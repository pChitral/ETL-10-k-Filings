318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2014,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.) This additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our products face substantial competition.We operate in a highly competitive environment. (See Item 1. Business — Competition.) Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. Our competitors market products or are actively engaged in R&D in areas where we have products, where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field with increasing frequency, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. As a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, better safety profile, are easier to administer, achieve earlier entry into the market or that are otherwise competitive with our products. Our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars or generics that come to market as branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. For example, upon the expiry of patent protection for Novartis’s Zometa® (zolendronic acid) in 2013, a number of companies have launched generic forms of zolendronic acid, which now compete against XGEVA®. Further, in November, Teva launched short-acting Granix® in the U.S. to compete with NEUPOGEN® and long-acting lipegfilgrastim in Europe to compete with Neulasta®. Further, EPOGEN® and Aranesp® may begin to face competition during the second half of 2014 from the launch of MIRCERA® in the United States.Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private insurers have pursued, and continue to pursue, aggressive cost containment initiatives, including increased focus on comparing the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom our products will be reimbursed by payers.25A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from U.S. federal government healthcare programs. Further, as the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid and the new Health Insurance Exchanges, CMS has substantial power to quickly implement policy changes that can significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. Additionally, there is an increased focus in the United States on analyzing the impact of various government programs on the federal deficit, which has resulted in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs. Private payers also continue to seek to reduce their costs. Additionally, the implementation of ACA’s Health Insurance Exchanges, where plans are required to meet certain coverage and cost sharing requirements in the face of increased regulation of rates and profits, could drive consolidation in the insurance industry. The resulting consolidated entities could have greater leverage in making coverage and reimbursement decisions and exert additional pressure on our ability to price and secure patient access for our products. Further, the current Health Care Exchange offerings have very high deductibles and cost-sharing requirements for drugs; if private payers were to broadly adopt these benefit levels for other plans, such change would have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Outside the United States, we expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce their healthcare expenditures. (See Item 1. Business — Reimbursement.) Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations.We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the U.S. reimbursement of and discounts for our products. Pricing data that we submit impacts the prices providers are paid, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare, Medicaid and other government drug programs, and the calculations are complex. Price reporting regulations require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions, and/or underlying data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, if our pricing calculations are incorrect, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin.Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:•regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;•adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier;•unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;•failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall;•a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials;•discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components; and•labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise.These events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product use and sales and our business and operating results. For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues which result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN® glass vials). We may experience or continue to experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. We continue to investigate alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require 26the use of certain biologically derived substances because such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. However, any disruptions or delays by us or by third-party suppliers or partners in converting to alternatives to certain biologically derived substances and alternative manufacturing processes or our ability to gain regulatory approval for the alternative materials and manufacturing processes could increase our associated costs or result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value of certain related assets, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently are involved in the manufacture of all of our principal products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of ENBREL, Prolia®, Sensipar®/Mimpara®, Nplate®, XGEVA®, Vectibix® and Kyprolis® and plan to use contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our late-stage product candidates. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by:•capacity of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers;•contamination by microorganisms or viruses; •natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;•labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise;•degree of compliance with regulatory requirements;•changes in forecasts of future demand;•timing and actual number of production runs;•updating of manufacturing specifications;•production success rates and yields;•contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; and•timing and outcome of product quality testing.If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Over the past several years we have initiated a number of voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, beginning in September 2010, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of EPOGEN® and J&J voluntarily recalled certain lots of PROCRIT®, manufactured by us, because a small number of vials in each lot were found to contain glass lamellae (extremely thin, barely visible glass flakes) which we believed was a result of the interaction of the product formulation with glass vials during the shelf life of the product. The recalls were executed in close cooperation with the FDA. We may experience the same or other problems in the future, resulting in broader product recalls, adverse event trends, delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and results of operations.Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA or other regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. For example, in order to mitigate the risk associated with the majority of our formulation and fill operations being performed in a single facility, we are completing the construction and qualification of a new formulation and filling facility at our Puerto Rico site, and we are modifying and expanding our recently acquired formulation, fill and finish manufacturing site in Ireland. Upon completion, these facilities will require licensure by the various regulatory authorities.If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our 27third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, the Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda, the Netherlands. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation for the distribution of our products to our customers which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats.We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials.We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN®, Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, Prolia® and XGEVA® and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. We also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN® and Aranesp®, all of the purification of bulk EPOGEN® material and substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for Prolia® and XGEVA® at this facility. We perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. A number of factors could materially and adversely affect our operations, including:•power failures and/or other utility failures;•breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment;•improper installation or operation of equipment;•labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak;•inability or unwillingness of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components; and•natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes or fires.In the past, the Puerto Rico facility has experienced manufacturing component shortages and there was evidence of adverse trends in the microbial bioburden of the production environment that reduced the production output. The same or other problems may result in our being unable to supply our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. Our Puerto Rico facility is also subject to the same difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing experienced in our other manufacturing facilities. For example, the limited number of lots EPOGEN® voluntarily recalled in 2010 were manufactured at our Puerto Rico facility. In future inspections, our failure to adequately address the FDA's expectations could lead to further inspections of the facility or regulatory actions. (See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.)Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful, and may result in costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions. We have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger, acquisition, partnering and in-license opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint, product offerings and/or our R&D pipeline. Acquisitions may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may result in the diversion of our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities. Failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses that we acquire (including their technology, compliance programs, financial systems, distribution and general business operations and procedures), while preserving important R&D, distribution, marketing, promotion and other relationships, may affect our ability to grow and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. For example, on October 1, 2013, we acquired Onyx, a biopharmaceutical company with several currently marketed products as well as pipeline candidates progressing through the development process and failures or difficulties in the integration of Onyx could result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.28Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation.Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, involved in patent litigation. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed, or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period of time from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover for the losses, damages, and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitors before expiry of the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the twelve year exclusivity period provided under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009.Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have recently expired or will expire over the next few years., (See Item 1. Business — Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products — Patents.) As our patents expire, competitors may be able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. (See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.) We have received, and we continue to seek, additional patent protection relating to our products, including patents on our products, specific processes for making our products, formulations and particular uses of our products. However, competitors may be able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products.Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets.We expect a significant portion of growth in our future business to come from expanding our footprint and presence in emerging markets. As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our current products into new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that the Company’s efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed or that the growth rates experienced in these countries will continue in the future. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including sovereign debt issues and/or fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The Company may also be required to increase its reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies that we partner with or acquire in emerging markets (See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.). Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and an evolving legal and regulatory environment. These legal and operational challenges along with the imposition of governmental controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintain necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products may result in a material adverse impact on the international sales of our products, our business and results of operations.29Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of free-standing dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our bargaining power and profit margins.The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales are made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN®, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics, which have experienced significant consolidation. Two organizations, DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care North America, own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for a substantial majority of all EPOGEN® sales in the free-standing dialysis clinic setting. Due to this concentration, these entities have substantial purchasing leverage, which may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins.Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. (See Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management's attention and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products.We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. As we announced on December 19, 2012, we finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices. However, we may also be subject to actions by governmental entities, including those not participating in the settlement, and may in the future become subject to claims by other parties, in each case with respect to the alleged conduct which is the subject of the settlement. We may see new governmental investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax and our tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. We believe our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open years based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. For example, there are several proposals under consideration in the United States to reform tax law, including proposals that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of U.S. income tax on our unrepatriated foreign earnings. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, such as a change to the taxation of income earned outside the United States including credits allowed for foreign taxes, or a significant change to the Puerto Rico tax system, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations.We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We may access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.30Our risk mitigation measures and corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we effectively manage all operational risks and that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or other requirements.The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval and Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) In addition, our business is complex and involves significant operational risks. While we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measures to comply with such regulations in this complex operating environment, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively mitigate all operational risks. Further, we are now operating under a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, OIG, which requires us to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined obligations. The corporate integrity agreement requires us to make periodic attestations that we are implementing and following the provisions of the corporate integrity agreement, and provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on our compliance to the OIG. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our partners, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws, all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws and/or all requirements of the corporate integrity agreement. If we fail to adequately mitigate our operational risks or if we or our agents fail to comply with any of those regulations, laws and/or requirements of the corporate integrity agreement, a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation. Such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data.We are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to the Company, its patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. While in the past we have experienced cyber-attacks and intrusions into our computer systems, we do not believe that such attacks have had a material adverse effect on our operations. While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us.Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world. As more fully explained below, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment through mandatory discounts on our products, policies requiring the automatic substitution of generics or biosimilars, higher hurdles for initial reimbursement approval for new products or other similar measures. (See We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.) Additionally, as a result of global economic conditions, third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. In addition, as a result of the economic conditions and/or employer decisions regarding the insurance coverage mandate that goes into effect in the United States in 2015 and 2016, some employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. Job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. These economic conditions may affect patients' ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products, including some patients delaying treatment, rationing prescription medications, leaving prescriptions unfilled, reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities, utilizing alternative therapies and/or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage. In addition to its effects on consumers, any economic downturn may have also increased cost sensitivities among medical providers in the United States, such as oncology clinics, particularly in circumstances where providers may experience challenges in the collection of patient co-pays or be forced to absorb treatment costs as a result of coverage decisions or reimbursement terms. Collectively, we believe these changes have resulted and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products, which could 31materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Any resulting decrease in demand for our products could also cause us to experience excess inventory write-offs and/or excess capacity or impairment charges at certain of our manufacturing facilities.Economic conditions continue to affect our operations and performance outside the United States as well, particularly in countries where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures. Credit and economic conditions have adversely impacted the timing of collections of our trade receivables. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation — Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.) Further economic challenges may impact our ability to collect some or all of our receivables, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows and a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.)We also rely upon third parties for certain parts of our business, including licensees and partners, wholesale distributors of our products, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and single third-party suppliers. There may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Current economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Further, economic conditions appear to have affected, and may continue to affect, the business practices of our wholesale distributors in a manner that contributes to lower sales of our products. Although we monitor our distributors', customers' and suppliers' financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. These risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with third parties with substantial operations in countries where current economic conditions are the most severe, particularly where such third parties are themselves exposed to sovereign risk from business interactions directly with fiscally-challenged government payers.We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on the sale of investments.Our stock price is volatile.Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations.Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or those other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies as well as reimbursement of our products by government and private payers. In addition, HTA organizations, such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.The commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products is dependent in part on our partners.We have entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Item 1. Business — Business Relationships.) Many of these agreements involve the sharing of certain decisions and a division of responsibilities, costs and benefits. If our partners fail to effectively deliver on their marketing and commercialization commitments to us or if we and our partners fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, sales of our products may be materially and adversely affected.32Cost savings initiatives may result in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired or other related charges being incurred.Our business continues to face many challenges. In response to these challenges, we have worked and continue to work to improve cost efficiencies and to reduce discretionary expenditures. As part of those efforts, we undertake cost savings initiatives to evaluate our processes and procedures in order to identify opportunities for achieving greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business. In particular, we evaluate our manufacturing operations to identify opportunities to increase production yields and/or success rates as well as capacity utilization. Depending on the timing and outcomes of these cost savings initiatives, the carrying value of certain manufacturing or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of impairment and/or other related charges. The recognition of such charges, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.Our Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends on our common stock since it adopted a dividend policy in 2011. Whether we continue and the amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and agreements of the Company applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. Future dividends, including their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; debt service requirements; our credit rating; changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all. The reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or of stolen or diverted products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet the exacting standards of our Company's development, manufacturing and distribution processes. Counterfeit medicines pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially life-threatening. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, products stolen from inventory, at warehouses, plants or while in transit or unlawfully diverted, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. Public loss of confidence in the integrity of biologics and/or pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Item 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.33Item 2.PROPERTIESAs of December 31, 2013, we owned or leased approximately 200 properties. The locations and primary functions of significant properties are summarized in the following table:In addition to the properties listed above, we have undeveloped land at certain U.S. locations, principally in Thousand Oaks, California; Longmont, Colorado; Louisville, Kentucky; Allentown, Pennsylvania; West Greenwich, Rhode Island; Seattle and Bothell, Washington; Juncos, Puerto Rico; Dun Laoghaire, Ireland; and Singapore (under construction), to accommodate future expansion as required. Excluded from the table above are leased properties that have been abandoned and certain buildings that we still own but are no longer used in our business. There are no material encumbrances on our properties.We believe that our facilities are suitable for their intended use and, in conjunction with our third-party contracting manufacturing agreements, provide adequate capacity. We also believe that our existing facilities, our third-party contract manufacturing agreements and our anticipated additions are sufficient to meet our expected needs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion on the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products.See Item 1. Business — Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials.

In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume” and “continue,” as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (EPS), liquidity and capital resources, trends and planned dividends and stock repurchases. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.OverviewThe following management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people's lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be the world's largest independent biotechnology company, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.Our principal products include Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN®, ENBREL, Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, XGEVA®, Prolia® and Sensipar®/Mimpara®. For additional information about our products, see Item 1. Business — Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.Revenues increased 8% driven by strong performance across the portfolio. Product sales grew 10% in the United States and 8% in the rest of the world (ROW). We also continued paying quarterly dividends in 2013, and in December 2013, we declared a dividend of $0.61 per share of common stock payable in March 2014, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in each of the past four quarters. In addition to delivering strong operating results, we invested heavily in the business in 2013 and that is reflected in our pipeline advancements. We had positive readouts for evolocumab, talimogene laherparepvec and trebananib and also made progress on our biosimilars as we commenced pivotal trials for three of our six programs. We are now present in more than 75 countries including Japan, China and other emerging markets. This expansion was helped, in part, by our reacquiring rights to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, effective January 1, 2014. Finally, we added Kyprolis® to our marketed products portfolio through the acquisition of Onyx and in-licensed the U.S. commercial rights to ivabradine from Servier.We expect 2014 to be a data-rich year with various opportunities to continue growing our business. We believe the currently approved indications for XGEVA® and Prolia® represent significant commercial opportunities. Longer-term growth may also be achieved by the successful development of 10 innovative molecules in our later stage pipeline, including Kyprolis® and evolocumab in both the United States and internationally. (See Item 1. Business — Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates.) Additionally, longer-term growth may be achieved by continued expansion into emerging markets and through strategic business development opportunities. Our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies will assist in providing the necessary resources to fund many of these future opportunities.39Our business will, however, continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will face increasing competitive pressure as a result of competitive product launches. Additionally, certain of the existing patents on our principal products — including NEUPOGEN®, EPOGEN®, Neulasta®and Aranesp® — recently expired or will expire over the next few years, and we expect to face increasing competition from competitive products including biosimilars. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Item 1. Business — Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products — Patents.Current global economic conditions also pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Efforts to reduce healthcare costs are being made by third-party payers including governments and private payers. In the United States, various actions have been taken aimed at reducing healthcare spending. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce our revenues or increase our expenses may be enacted. As a result of economic conditions, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures in certain European countries also.Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. The discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. We must develop new products over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched, as well as in order to provide for revenue and earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.Finally, our product sales are subject to certain influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and end-user buying patterns (e.g., wholesaler and end-user stocking, contract-driven buying and patients delaying certain purchasing or physician visits). Such factors can result in higher demand for our products and/or higher wholesaler inventory levels and, therefore, higher product sales for a given three-month period, generally followed by a decline in product sales in the subsequent three-month period. For example, sales of certain of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 can be slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three-month period. While this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis, these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended March 31 with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year.See Item 1. Business — Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales.Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): 2013 Change 2012Product sales: U.S.$14,045 10 % $12,815ROW4,147 8 % 3,824Total product sales18,192 9 % 16,639Other revenues484 (23)% 626Total revenues$18,676 8 % $17,265Operating expenses$12,809 10 % $11,688Operating income$5,867 5 % $5,577Net income$5,081 17 % $4,345Diluted EPS$6.64 20 % $5.52Diluted shares765 (3)% 787In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.The increase in U.S. product sales for 2013 reflects growth across the portfolio except for Aranesp®, which declined 4%. The growth was driven primarily by increases in average net sales prices and, to a lesser extent, unit growth. The increase in ROW product sales for 2013 reflects growth for all of our marketed products except Aranesp®, which declined 7%, and NEUPOGEN®, which declined 9%. The ROW increase was driven by unit growth.40The decrease in other revenues for 2013 was due primarily to revenue recognized in the prior year related to changes in our motesanib collaboration with Takeda and milestone payments received in the prior year from AstraZeneca and Astellas Pharma Inc. The modification to the Takeda arrangement resulted in revenue recognition of $230 million in 2012 and resulted in Takeda receiving an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize motesanib.The increase in operating expenses for 2013 was driven primarily by R&D and Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) spending including the addition of Onyx effective October 1, 2013.The increase in net income for 2013 was due primarily to a lower effective income tax rate as well as higher Operating income.The increase in diluted EPS for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase in net income and, to a lesser extent, by the favorable impact of our stock repurchase program in 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted EPS. We did not repurchase any shares during the second, third or fourth quarters of 2013.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2013, 2012 or 2011.Results of OperationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®$5,790 8 % $5,352 3 % $5,212ENBREL4,551 7 % 4,236 14 % 3,701Aranesp®1,911 (6)% 2,040 (11)% 2,303EPOGEN®1,953 1 % 1,941 (5)% 2,040XGEVA®1,019 36 % 748 * 351Prolia®744 58 % 472 * 203Sensipar®/Mimpara®1,089 15 % 950 18 % 808Other products1,135 26 % 900 33 % 677Total product sales$18,192 9 % $16,639 9 % $15,295Total U.S.$14,045 10 % $12,815 9 % $11,725Total ROW4,147 8 % 3,824 7 % 3,570Total product sales$18,192 9 % $16,639 9 % $15,295* Change in excess of 100%Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Item 1.

The increase in global NEUPOGEN® sales for 2013 was driven by a $155-million order from the U.S. government. Excluding the special order, U.S. sales grew only 1% and global sales declined 1%. Units declined in 2013 in both the United States and ROW.The increase in U.S. Neulasta® sales for 2012 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price. The decrease in ROW Neulasta® sales for 2012 was due primarily to a decrease in unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe and a decrease in the average net sales price.The increase in U.S. NEUPOGEN® sales for 2012 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price. The decrease in ROW NEUPOGEN® sales for 2012 was driven by a decrease in unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe.Our material U.S. patents for filgrastim (NEUPOGEN®) expired in December 2013. We now face competition in the United States, which may have a material adverse impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN® and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta®. Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) expires in 2015.Future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011ENBREL — U.S. $4,256 7% $3,967 15% $3,458ENBREL — Canada 295 10% 269 11% 243Total ENBREL $4,551 7% $4,236 14% $3,701The increase in ENBREL sales for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by slight unit declines.The increase in ENBREL sales for 2012 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, an increase in unit demand.ENBREL also faces increased competition. See Item 1. Business — Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products — Competition.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011Aranesp® — U.S.$747 (4)% $782 (21)% $986Aranesp® — ROW1,164 (7)% 1,258 (4)% 1,317Total Aranesp®$1,911 (6)% $2,040 (11)% $2,30342The decreases in U.S. Aranesp® sales for both 2013 and 2012 were driven by declines in unit demand. The unit declines reflect changes in practice patterns resulting from changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011.The decrease in ROW Aranesp® sales for 2013 reflects unit declines and price pressure in Europe. In 2012, the ROW decline was driven by a decrease in the average net sales price.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011EPOGEN® — U.S.$1,953 1% $1,941 (5)% $2,040EPOGEN® sales for 2013 increased by 1% due to unit growth.The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for 2012 was driven by a 23% decrease in unit demand, driven by reductions in dose utilization due to changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred in 2011. This decrease was offset partially by reductions in customer discounts, as part of new provider contracts that became effective January 1, 2012, and by a year-over-year favorable change in accounting estimates of $96 million.Future EPOGEN® sales will also depend, in part, on such factors as:•response to changes in reimbursement including recent reduction to the ESRD payment bundle effective January 1, 2014;•potential increased competition in the U.S. dialysis setting; and•changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling.See Item 1.

The excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) also slightly contributed to the decrease. The rate was 4.0% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in the first half of 2013 and 4.0% effective July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017. See Note 4, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.Cost of sales increased to 19.2% of product sales for 2012, driven primarily by product mix and the Puerto Rico excise tax. 44Excluding the impact of the excise tax, cost of sales would have been 16.4%, 17.2% and 16.3% of product sales for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.Research and developmentR&D costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems’ costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with K-A and third-party R&D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery.The Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences, (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Company’s R&D activities as set forth in the following table:Category DescriptionDiscovery Research and Translational Sciences R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our discovery research and translational sciences functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development.Later stage clinical programs R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU.Marketed products R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained.R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): 2013 2012 2011Discovery Research and Translational Sciences$1,233 $1,137 $1,125Later stage clinical programs1,950 1,285 983Marketed products900 958 1,059Total R&D expense$4,083 $3,380 $3,167The increase in R&D expense for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase of $665 million in our later stage clinical programs, including evolocumab and Kyprolis®; and an increase of $96 million in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $58 million.The increase in R&D expense for 2012 was driven primarily by an increase of $302 million in our later stage clinical programs, including evolocumab and romosozumab; and an increase of $12 million in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $101 million.Selling, general and administrativeSG&A expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; the annual U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. SG&A expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or when we become entitled to the cost recovery.The increase in SG&A expense for 2013 was driven primarily by the addition of Onyx of $276 million, of which $215 million was acquisition-related and does not have a continuing impact on the combined company’s operating results. Included in these costs are advisory, legal and regulatory costs, and compensation related payments. The compensation payments include cash 45payments for accelerated vesting of equity awards as part of the acquisition that were previously granted under the Onyx equity award programs which would not have otherwise vested. SG&A also increased by $98 million related primarily to favorable changes in 2012 to the estimated U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee.The increase in SG&A expense for 2012 was driven primarily by higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $207 million as well as international expansion, offset partially by lower U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee expense of $106 million in 2012 compared with 2011, which includes a $61 million favorable adjustment related to the 2011 fee.Historically, under our ENBREL collaboration agreement, we paid Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada on a scale that increased with gross profits. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired on October 31, 2013, and we are now required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada of 12% through October 31, 2014, 11% through October 31, 2015 and 10% through October 31, 2016.OtherOther operating expenses for 2013 included $113 million of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex) business combination, certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives of $71 million, which includes severance expenses, and $12 million of other charges related primarily to legal proceedings.Other operating expenses for 2012 included charges of $175 million related to our cost savings initiatives, which includes severance and expenses associated with abandoning leased facilities, legal charges of $64 million and other operating expenses of $56 million, which includes adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex business combination.Other operating expenses for 2011 included primarily a legal settlement charge of $780 million and charges related to cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $109 million.See Item 1. Government Regulation — Other Regulation and Note 8, Other charges, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our legal settlement.Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2013 2012 2011Interest expense, net$1,022 $1,053 $610Interest and other income, net$420 $485 $448Provisions for income taxes$184 $664 $467Effective tax rate3.5% 13.3% 11.3%Interest expense, netThe decrease in interest expense, net in 2013 was due primarily to the decrease in non-cash interest resulting from the settlement of our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes in February 2013 offset partially by increases resulting from the higher average balance of other outstanding debt and financing fees paid in association with the acquisition of Onyx. The increase in interest expense, net in 2012 was due primarily to a higher average debt balance.Interest and other income, netThe decrease in interest and other income, net for 2013 was due primarily to lower net gains on sales of investments recognized in the current year. The increase in interest and other income, net for 2012 was due primarily to higher interest income due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities offset partially by lower yields and lower net gains realized on investments.Income taxesThe decrease in our effective rate for 2013 was due primarily to three significant events occurring in 2013: (i) the acquisition of Onyx, which resulted in a tax benefit of $182 million; (ii) the $187 million settlement of our examination with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 in which we agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS and remeasured our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) accordingly; and (iii) the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 and 2013. Because the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was not enacted until 2013, certain provisions of the Act benefiting the Company's 2012 federal taxes, including the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2012, were not 46recognized in the Company's 2012 financial results and instead are reflected in the Company's 2013 financial results. The tax benefit of the retroactive extension of the 2012 R&D tax credit that was recognized in 2013 was $70 million. Additionally, our rate was further reduced by the indefinitely reinvested earnings of our foreign operations. The increase in our effective tax rate for 2012 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and the exclusion of the federal R&D tax credit in 2012, offset partially by the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters related to prior years. The effective tax rates for 2013, 2012 and 2011 would have been approximately 9.2%, 18.7%, and 18.0%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax.As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States.See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies — Income taxes and Note 4, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected financial data was as follows as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in millions): 2013 2012Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$19,401 $24,061Restricted investments3,412 — Total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments$22,813 $24,061Total assets66,125 54,298Current portion of long-term debt2,505 2,495Long-term debt29,623 24,034Stockholders’ equity22,096 19,060The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. Whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors — There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends). In April 2011, the Board of Directors approved a dividend policy related to our common stock and subsequently declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.28 per share of common stock during the second half of 2011. Subsequently, the Board of Directors declared a 29% increase in our quarterly cash dividends to $0.36 per share of common stock in 2012, and a 31% increase in our quarterly cash dividends to $0.47 per share of common stock in 2013. In December 2013, the Board of Directors declared a 30% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.61 per share of common stock, payable in March 2014.The Company has also returned capital to stockholders through its stock repurchase program. During 2011, 2012 and 2013, we spent $8.3 billion, $4.6 billion and $832 million, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013, $1.6 billion remains available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program; however, we do not expect to make significant repurchases of our common stock during 2014 and 2015. In connection with the acquisition of Onyx in October 2013, we entered into a Repurchase Agreement and a Term Loan Credit Facility. See Note 2, Business combinations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, we sold 34,097 Class A preferred shares of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, ATL Holdings Limited, on September 30, 2013. We are obligated to repurchase the Class A preferred shares from the counterparties on or before September 28, 2018, for the aggregate sale price of $3.1 billion. Under the Repurchase Agreement, which is accounted for as long-term debt, we are obligated to make payments to the counterparties based on the sale price of the outstanding preferred shares at a floating interest rate of London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) plus 1.1%. The Repurchase Agreement contains customary events of default, and we have the right to repurchase all or a portion of the Class A preferred shares at any time prior to the required repurchase date.On October 1, 2013, we borrowed $5.0 billion under a Term Loan Credit Facility which bears interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus additional interest, initially 1%, which can vary based on the credit ratings assigned to our long-term debt by Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC (S&P) and Moody's Investor Service, Inc. (Moody's). A portion of the principal amount of this debt is to be repaid at the end of each quarter equal to 2.5% of the original amount of the loan, or $125 million, with the balance due on October 1, 2018.47In February 2013, our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes matured/converted, and accordingly, the $2.5 billion principal amount was settled in cash. In addition, in May 2013, warrants to acquire 32 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $104.80 originally sold in connection with the issuance of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes were exercised resulting in a net cash payment of $100 million.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our revolving credit agreement and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as “U.S. funds”) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of December 31, 2013, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $419 million, of which $301 million was past due. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary. Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investmentsOf our total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investment balances totaling approximately $22.8 billion as of December 31, 2013, approximately $20.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Financing arrangementsThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2013, were $2.5 billion and $29.6 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2012, were $2.5 billion and $24.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, S&P, Moody's and Fitch, Inc. assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a negative outlook and BBB with a negative outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings and would affect the interest rate paid under our Term Loan Credit Facility.We issued long-term debt during the three years ended December 31, 2013, including $8.1 billion, $5.0 billion, and $10.5 billion aggregate principal amounts in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We repaid debt of $3.4 billion, $123 million, and $2.5 billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and were designated as fair value hedges. In 2013, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $4.4 billion. In addition, we previously had interest rate swap contracts on debt with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion which, due to historically low interest rates, were terminated in May 482012. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts.To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion. See Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2013, we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.In December 2011, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.In March 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC which allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in March 2014 and is expected to be renewed before its expiration date.In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2013.See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements.Cash flowsA summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): 2013 2012 2011Net cash provided by operating activities$6,291 $5,882 $5,119Net cash used in investing activities(8,469) (9,990) (786)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities2,726 419 (674)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2013 due primarily to the 2012 impacts of the payment associated with a previously disclosed litigation settlement and higher payments to taxing authorities, offset partially by cash receipts in 2012 of $397 million in connection with the termination of interest rate swap agreements and $197 million received under a government-funded program in Spain with regard to trade receivables. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2012 compared with 2011 due primarily to the timing and amount of receipts from customers, timing of payments to vendors and taxing authorities, cash received in connection with the termination of our interest rate swap agreements discussed above and the impact of decreased inventory-related expenditures. These increases were offset partially by a payment associated with the previously disclosed litigation settlement.49InvestingCapital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Ireland and Puerto Rico, as well as other site developments, totaled $693 million, $689 million and $567 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We currently estimate 2014 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $800 million.Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $9.4 billion, $2.4 billion and $701 million, respectively.Net sales of marketable securities were $2.2 billion for 2013, compared to net purchases of $6.9 billion for 2012 and net sales of $437 million for 2011.FinancingCash provided by financing activities during 2013 was due to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $8.1 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $296 million. These receipts were offset partially by the repayment of long-term debt of $3.4 billion, the payment of dividends of $1.4 billion, and repurchases of our common stock of $832 million. Cash provided by financing activities during 2012 was due to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.9 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $1.3 billion, offset partially by repurchases of common stock of $4.6 billion and the payment of dividends of $1.1 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2011 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $8.3 billion; repayment of long-term debt of $2.5 billion; and payment of dividends of $500 million, offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $10.4 billion.See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.Contractual ObligationsContractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period Year Years Years YearsContractual obligationsTotal 1 2 and 3 4 and 5 6 and beyondLong-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4)$50,245 $3,625 $5,007 $12,412 $29,201Operating lease obligations905 140 239 181 345Purchase obligations (5)2,249 895 450 245 659UTBs (6)— — — — —Total contractual obligations$53,399 $4,660 $5,696 $12,838 $30,205(1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments which are included in our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2013, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net increase in future interest payments of $68 million. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts.50(2) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments under our Master Repurchase Agreement and Term Loan at LIBOR-based variable rates of interest. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2013, in computing interest payments on these debt obligations. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these debt obligations.(3) Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt issued in 2012 and 2011, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from pounds sterling/euros to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts.(4) Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2013. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations.(5) Purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third-party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.(6) Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2013, are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities.In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of BioVex and Onyx. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2013, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $3.3 billion, including $875 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisitions of BioVex and Onyx. See Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.51Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.Product sales and sales deductionsRevenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, “sales deductions”) and returns, which are established at the time of sale.We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions TotalBalance as of January 1, 2011$844 $173 $127 $1,144Amounts charged against product sales1,795 2,626 670 5,091Payments(1,592) (2,600) (717) (4,909)Balance as of December 31, 20111,047 199 80 1,326Amounts charged against product sales1,480 2,709 659 4,848Payments(1,680) (2,741) (624) (5,045)Balance as of December 31, 2012847 167 115 1,129Amounts charged against product sales1,784 3,008 669 5,461Payments(1,736) (2,924) (682) (5,342)Balance as of December 31, 2013$895 $251 $102 $1,248For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, total sales deductions were 23%, 23% and 25% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent 3% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2013.In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold.Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid by us based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which can take more than one year. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. For example, we had managed Medicaid rebate adjustments of $164 million in 2013. Including this adjustment, changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods were less than 10% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, and less than 5% for the year ended December 31, 2011. A 10% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized 52in 2013 would have had an impact of approximately $180 million, or approximately 1% of our 2013 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity.Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.Product returnsReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the last three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant.Income taxesThe Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.Certain items are included in the Company's tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.The Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Company’s pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Company’s operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020.Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Company’s foreign income associated with the Company’s operations conducted in Puerto Rico.If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results.53Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies.While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinationsWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:•determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;•projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;•estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and•developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of various contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses (see Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.Impairment of long-lived assetsWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value.Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility, are reviewed annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 54carrying amount may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.In the capital and credit markets, we experienced an increase in interest rates during 2013. As a result, in the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2013 and 2012. We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsOur portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities at December 31, 2013 and 2012, was comprised of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest-bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $22.3 billion and $23.7 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2013 and 2012, would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2013 and 2012, would not result in a material effect on income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year.As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $32.1 billion and a fair value of $33.5 billion. As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $26.5 billion and a fair value of $29.9 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2013 and 2012, was comprised of debt with fixed interest rates, except for $8.1 billion of debt issued in connection with the acquisition of Onyx outstanding at December 31, 2013. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.2 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.6 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts.To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts during 2013, which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These derivative contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $4.4 billion were outstanding at December 31, 2013. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $300 million on our interest rate swap contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. 55As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion that hedge certain of our foreign denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros/pounds sterling and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2013 and 2012, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $320 million and $400 million, respectively, but would have no material effect on cash flows or income in the respective ensuing year.Foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $750 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $730 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $760 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $700 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt.With regard to our $2.7 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros and pound sterling as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on this date, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $660 million and $710 million on this date, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The impact on income in the ensuing years from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2013, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $4.0 billion and $516 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.7 billion and $200 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the net unrealized gains on these contracts were not material. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2013, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $820 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $400 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2012, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $730 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $350 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $999 million and $629 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2013 and 2012. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2013 and 2012, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in a reduction of approximately $160 million and $60 million, respectively, in the fair value of these contracts on this date, but would not result in a material effect on income or cash flows in the respective ensuing 56year. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Market price sensitive financial instrumentsAs of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, was not material.Counterparty credit risksOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with investment grade credit ratings and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.",2023-12-30 18:05:12.606654
318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2015,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.) Further economic challenges may impact our ability to collect some or all of our receivables, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows and a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.)We also rely upon third parties for certain parts of our business, including licensees and partners, wholesale distributors of our products, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and single third-party suppliers. There may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Current economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Further, economic conditions appear to have affected, and may continue to affect, the business practices of our wholesale distributors in a manner that contributes to lower sales of our products. Although we monitor our distributors', customers' and suppliers' financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. These risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with third parties with substantial operations in countries where current economic conditions are the most severe, particularly where such third parties are themselves exposed to sovereign risk from business interactions directly with fiscally-challenged government payers.We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on the sale of investments.34Our stock price is volatile.Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations.Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or those other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies as well as reimbursement of our products by government and private payers. In addition, HTA organizations, such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.The commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products is dependent in part on our partners.We have entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Item 1. Business—Business Relationships.) Many of these agreements involve the sharing of certain decisions and a division of responsibilities, costs and benefits. If our partners fail to effectively deliver on their marketing and commercialization commitments to us or if we and our partners fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, sales of our products may be materially and adversely affected.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will repurchase stock.Our Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends on our common stock since it adopted a dividend policy in 2011. In addition, in October 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our stock repurchase program that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available under the repurchase program. Whether we pay such dividends and repurchase our stock in the future, and the amount and timing of such dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and agreements of the Company applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of stock. Future dividends and stock repurchases, including their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; debt service requirements; our credit rating; changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares. Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. The reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price. The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or of stolen or diverted products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet the exacting standards of our Company's development, manufacturing and distribution processes. Counterfeit medicines pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially life-threatening. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, products stolen from inventory, at warehouses, plants or while in transit or unlawfully diverted, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. Public loss of confidence in the integrity of biologics and/or pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.35We may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our recently announced restructuring plan.During the second half of 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules, while improving our cost structure. As part of the plan, we expect to reduce staff and close or dispose of certain facilities. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits and savings from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.Following the completion of our restructuring, we must execute our core business initiatives, including advancing our pipeline and addressing competition from competitor products and biosimilars, with fewer human resources. We must also attract, retain and motivate key employees that are critical to our business. If we are unable to effectively execute with fewer staff members and/or attract, retain or motivate key employees, it may adversely affect our business.Item 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.36Item 2.PROPERTIESAs of December 31, 2014, we owned or leased approximately 200 properties. The locations and primary functions of significant properties are summarized in the following table:Excluded from the table above are undeveloped land and leased properties that have been abandoned and certain buildings that we still own but are no longer used in our business. There are no material encumbrances on our properties.We believe that our facilities are suitable for their intended use and, in conjunction with our third-party contracting manufacturing agreements, provide adequate capacity and are sufficient to meet our expected needs.

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.Forward-looking statementsThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume,” and “continue,” as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (EPS), liquidity and capital resources, trends and planned dividends, stock repurchases and restructuring plans.

This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people's lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world's leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.Our principal products include Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN®, ENBREL, XGEVA®, Prolia®, EPOGEN®, Aranesp® and Sensipar®/Mimpara®. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.Our strategy for long-term growth continues to focus on discovery and development of innovative medicines to address serious illnesses, development of branded biosimilars, global expansion, next-generation manufacturing of high quality biologics, development of improved biologic drug delivery systems and return of capital to shareholders.In 2014, we advanced our strategy. Revenues increased 7% driven by strong performance across the portfolio. Product sales grew 5% in the United States and 11% in the rest of the world (ROW). We continued returning capital to shareholders through the payment of dividends and through stock repurchases. We paid dividends of $0.61 per share of common stock in each of the four quarters of 2014, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in each of the four quarters of 2013. In December 2014, we declared a dividend of $0.79 per share of common stock, payable in March 2015, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in 2014. In October 2014, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our stock repurchase authorization that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available under that program. We reinitiated repurchase activity in November 2014 and repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $153 million during the remainder of 2014.42In addition to delivering strong operating results, our innovative pipeline, which includes both internally-developed and externally-acquired opportunities, continued to advance in 2014, with the following milestones achieved:Clinical Program Lead Indication MilestoneRepatha™ Dyslipidemia US submission EU submissionCorlanor® Chronic heart failure US submissionKyprolis®* Multiple myeloma Phase 3 ASPIRE dataTalimogene laherparepvec Metastatic melanoma US submission EU submissionBLINCYTO™ Relapsed/refractory ALL US approval EU submissionBrodalumab** Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis Phase 3 dataAMG 416 Secondary hyperparathyroidism Phase 3 dataAMG 334 Migraine prophylaxis Phase 2b data (episodic)* Marketed by Onyx, an Amgen subsidiary** Developed in collaboration with AstraZenecaDuring 2014, six of our medicines generated positive registration-enabling data and four were submitted for regulatory approval. In December 2014, the FDA approved BLINCYTO™ and the Neulasta® Delivery Kit, including the On-body Injector for Neulasta®. In 2014, we also advanced and expanded our biosimilar program, including announcing plans to add three more biosimilar molecules to our portfolio—for a total of nine. Finally, in January 2015, we and Onyx announced the submission of a sNDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for Kyprolis® to seek approval for the treatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.We believe that we are uniquely positioned for the opportunities arising in biology and to deliver our strategy. We have near- and long-term growth opportunities ahead, including: (i) the approval and launch of new indications for Kyprolis® in the United States and Europe as well as the approval and launch of several new innovative biologics, including Repatha™ and brodalumab, (ii) continuing to move into new geographic growth markets and (iii) the development, approval and launch of our biosimilars. We are present in more than 75 countries and, in 2014 we continued to expand into new geographic growth markets, including additional markets in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia.We announced a restructuring plan during the second half of 2014 that reduces our staff and our facilities footprint by the end of 2015. This restructuring plan allows us to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules while improving our cost structure. We are also advancing a number of key initiatives to streamline processes, increase agility and efficiencies, and improve operating performance. These initiatives include improved contracting and sourcing, rationalizing discretionary spending, greater use of shared services and optimizing R&D efficiency. Also during 2014, we completed facilities construction and entered the licensure process for a Next-Generation Biomanufacturing facility in Singapore which we believe, when licensed, will enable us to increase our manufacturing productivity versus conventional alternatives at lower capital costs and operating expense. Our restructuring plan and our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies in all areas of the company will enable us to reallocate resources to fund many of our growth opportunities to deliver value to patients and shareholders.Our business will continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will face increasing competitive pressure as a result of competitive product launches. Additionally, certain of the existing patents on our principal products recently expired or will expire this year or over the next few years, and we expect to face increasing competition, including biosimilars. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents and see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition.Current global economic conditions also pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Efforts to reduce healthcare costs are being made by third-party payers including governments and private payers. In the United States, various actions have been taken aimed at reducing healthcare spending. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce our revenues or increase our expenses may be enacted. As a result of economic conditions, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures in certain non-U.S. countries also.43Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. The discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. We must develop new products over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched, as well as in order to provide for revenue and earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.Finally, our product sales can be affected by wholesaler and end-user buying patterns. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales. For example, sales of certain of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 are usually lower relative to the preceding fourth quarter. These effects have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year.See Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales.Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013Product sales: U.S.$14,732 5% $14,045ROW4,595 11% 4,147Total product sales19,327 6% 18,192Other revenues736 52% 484Total revenues$20,063 7% $18,676Operating expenses$13,872 8% $12,809Operating income$6,191 6% $5,867Net income$5,158 2% $5,081Diluted EPS$6.70 1% $6.64Diluted shares770 1% 765In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.The increase in U.S. product sales for 2014 reflects growth across the portfolio except for NEUPOGEN®, which declined 28%. This overall growth was driven primarily by increases in average net sales prices and, to a lesser extent, unit growth, offset partially by a decline in wholesaler and, based on prescription data for ENBREL and Sensipar®, end-user inventory levels. Also, 2014 included a full year of Kyprolis® product sales as a result of the Onyx acquisition on October 1, 2013. The increase in ROW product sales for 2014 reflects growth primarily in our marketed products except ENBREL and Aranesp®, which declined 4% and 2%, respectively. The ROW increase was driven by unit growth, offset partially by declines in average net sales prices.The increase in other revenues for 2014 was due primarily to a full year of Nexavar® collaboration revenues as a result of the Onyx acquisition. The increase in operating expenses for 2014 was driven primarily by cost of sales and restructuring charges, offset partially by the end of the ENBREL profit share on October 31, 2013. The increase in net income for 2014 was due primarily to higher operating income, offset partially by a higher effective income tax rate.The increase in diluted EPS for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in net income offset partially by an increase in diluted shares.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging 44activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2014, 2013 or 2012.Results of OperationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®$5,755 (1)% $5,790 8 % $5,352ENBREL4,688 3 % 4,551 7 % 4,236XGEVA®1,221 20 % 1,019 36 % 748Prolia®1,030 38 % 744 58 % 472EPOGEN®2,031 4 % 1,953 1 % 1,941Aranesp®1,930 1 % 1,911 (6)% 2,040Sensipar®/Mimpara®1,158 6 % 1,089 15 % 950Other products1,514 33 % 1,135 26 % 900Total product sales$19,327 6 % $18,192 9 % $16,639Total U.S.$14,732 5 % $14,045 10 % $12,815Total ROW4,595 11 % 4,147 8 % 3,824Total product sales$19,327 6 % $18,192 9 % $16,639Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part 1—Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition, Part 1—Item 1A. Risk Factors and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. In addition, for a list of our products' significant competitors, see Part 1—Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition.Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® Total Neulasta® and total NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012Neulasta® — U.S.$3,649 4 % $3,499 9 % $3,207Neulasta® — ROW947 6 % 893 1 % 885Total Neulasta®4,596 5 % 4,392 7 % 4,092NEUPOGEN® — U.S.839 (28)% 1,169 16 % 1,007NEUPOGEN® — ROW320 40 % 229 (9)% 253Total NEUPOGEN®1,159 (17)% 1,398 11 % 1,260Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®$5,755 (1)% $5,790 8 % $5,352The increase in global Neulasta® sales for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States. The decrease in global NEUPOGEN® sales for 2014 was driven by the $155-million order from the U.S. government in 2013. Excluding the special order, U.S. and global sales declined 17% and 7%, respectively, which reflected decreases in unit demand in the United States, offset partially by the increased sales as a result of acquiring rights to filgrastim in certain regions effective January 1, 2014. In December 2014, the FDA granted approval of the Neulasta® Delivery Kit, including the On-body Injector for Neulasta®, which enables the healthcare provider to initiate administration of Neulasta® on the same day as cytotoxic chemotherapy with delivery of the patient’s full dose of Neulasta® the day following chemotherapy administration, consistent with the Neulasta® prescribing information.The increase in global Neulasta® sales for 2013 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States, offset partially by a decline in units. The increase in global NEUPOGEN® sales for 2013 was driven by the $155-million order 45from the U.S. government. Excluding the special order, U.S. sales grew only 1% and global sales declined 1%. Units declined in 2013 in both the United States and ROW.Our material U.S. patents for filgrastim (NEUPOGEN®) expired in December 2013. We face competition in the United States, which could have an impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN® and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta®. Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) expires in 2015. Apotex, Inc. announced that the FDA accepted for filing their applications, under the abbreviated pathway, for pegfilgrastim, a biosimilar version of Neulasta®, on December 17, 2014, and for filgrastim, a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®, on February 17, 2015. On January 7, 2015, Sandoz, a Novartis company, announced that the FDA ODAC recommended approval of its investigational biosimilar filgrastim. The Sandoz biosimilar filgrastim is the subject of ongoing litigation between us and Sandoz.See Part 1, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition and Part IV—Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012ENBREL — U.S.$4,404 3 % $4,256 7% $3,967ENBREL — Canada284 (4)% 295 10% 269Total ENBREL$4,688 3 % $4,551 7% $4,236The increase in ENBREL sales for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by unfavorable changes in wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories.The increase in ENBREL sales for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by slight unit declines.XGEVA® and Prolia® Total XGEVA® and total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012XGEVA® — U.S.$857 12% $764 19% $644XGEVA® — ROW364 43% 255 * 104Total XGEVA®1,221 20% 1,019 36% 748Prolia® — U.S.625 35% 462 58% 292Prolia® — ROW405 44% 282 57% 180Total Prolia®1,030 38% 744 58% 472Total XGEVA®/Prolia®$2,251 28% $1,763 45% $1,220* Change in excess of 100%The increases in global XGEVA® and Prolia® sales for 2014 and 2013 were driven primarily by unit growth.46EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012EPOGEN® — U.S.$2,031 4% $1,953 1% $1,941The increase in EPOGEN® sales for 2014 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by unit declines.EPOGEN® sales for 2013 increased by 1% due to unit growth.Our remaining material U.S. patent for EPOGEN® expires in May 2015. As a result, we may face competition in the United States, which may have a material adverse impact over time on EPOGEN® sales. In addition, EPOGEN® and Aranesp® will face competition from the launch of MIRCERA® in the United States. Roche began selling MIRCERA® in October 2014 in the United States under terms of a limited patent license obtained from Amgen in connection with the settlement of patent litigation. MIRCERA® competes with Aranesp® in the nephrology segment only. On December 16, 2014, Hospira, Inc. submitted a BLA to the FDA for Retacrit™, a proposed biosimilar to EPOGEN®, under the abbreviated pathway.In addition, future EPOGEN® sales will also depend, in part, on such factors as response to changes in reimbursement, including the reduction to the ESRD payment bundle effective January 1, 2014, and changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling. See Part 1, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012Aranesp® — U.S.$794 6 % $747 (4)% $782Aranesp® — ROW1,136 (2)% 1,164 (7)% 1,258Total Aranesp®$1,930 1 % $1,911 (6)% $2,040The increase in U.S. Aranesp® sales for 2014 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, unit demand. The decrease in ROW Aranesp® sales for 2014 reflects price declines offset partially by unit demand in international markets.The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for 2013 was driven by declines in unit demand. The unit declines reflect changes in practice patterns resulting from changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011.The decrease in ROW Aranesp® sales for 2013 reflects unit declines and price pressure in Europe.Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012Sensipar® — U.S.$796 5% $757 18% $639Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW362 9% 332 7% 311Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$1,158 6% $1,089 15% $950The increases in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for 2014 and 2013 were driven primarily by unit growth and increases in the average net sales price in the United States; however, the increases in 2014 were offset partially by unfavorable changes in U.S. wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories.47Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012Vectibix® — U.S.$168 33 % $126 3% $122Vectibix® — ROW337 28 % 263 11% 237Nplate® — U.S.260 8 % 241 13% 214Nplate® — ROW209 12 % 186 21% 154Kyprolis® — U.S.306 * 71 N/A —Kyprolis® — ROW25 * 2 N/A —BLINCYTO™ — U.S.3 N/A — N/A —Other — ROW206 (16)% 246 42% 173Total other product sales$1,514 33 % $1,135 26% $900Total U.S. — other products$737 68 % $438 30% $336Total ROW — other products777 11 % 697 24% 564Total other product sales$1,514 33 % $1,135 26% $900* Change in excess of 100%Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012Operating expenses: Cost of sales$4,422 32 % $3,346 5 % $3,199% of product sales22.9% 18.4% 19.2%% of total revenues22.0% 17.9% 18.5%Research and development$4,297 5 % $4,083 21 % $3,380% of product sales22.2% 22.4% 20.3%% of total revenues21.4% 21.9% 19.6%Selling, general and administrative$4,699 (9)% $5,184 8 % $4,814% of product sales24.3% 28.5% 28.9%% of total revenues23.4% 27.8% 27.9%Other$454 * $196 (34)% $295* Change in excess of 100%RestructuringWe announced a restructuring plan during the second half of 2014 to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules while improving our cost structure. As part of the plan, we stated that we would reduce our staff by 3,500 to 4,000 by the end of 2015 and close our facilities in Washington state and Colorado and reduce the number of buildings at our headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California. Company-wide, these actions will result in an approximate 23% reduction in our facilities footprint. We estimate that these actions will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $935 million to $1,035 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we initiated the above-noted actions and incurred $558 million of restructuring costs. We expect that substantially all remaining restructuring actions and related estimated costs will be incurred in 2015.48Net savings were not significant in 2014 due to investments in later stage clinical programs, new product launch preparation and external business development.Additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Part IV—Note 2, Restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Cost of salesCost of sales increased to 22.0% of total revenues for 2014, driven by acquisition-related expenses that included an increase of $642 million of non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Onyx acquisition. The year ended December 31, 2014, also included impairment and accelerated depreciation charges pursuant to our restructuring initiative of $104 million and a $99-million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014. Cost of sales decreased to 17.9% of total revenues for 2013, driven primarily by lower royalties and higher average net sales prices, offset partially by changes in product mix. The excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) also slightly contributed to the decrease. The rate was 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in the first half of 2013 and 4.0% effective July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017. See Part IV—Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the impact of the excise tax, cost of sales would have been 20.1%, 16.0% and 16.5% of total revenues for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Research and developmentR&D costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems’ costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with K-A and third-party R&D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery.The Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS), (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Company’s R&D activities as set forth in the following table:Category DescriptionDRTS R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our DRTS functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development.Later stage clinical programs R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU.Marketed products R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained.R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012DRTS$1,212 $1,233 $1,137Later stage clinical programs2,287 1,950 1,285Marketed products798 900 958Total R&D expense$4,297 $4,083 $3,38049The increase in R&D expense for 2014 was driven primarily by increased costs of $326 million associated with Onyx across all categories of R&D spend, as well as increased costs associated with other later stage clinical program support. Overall, costs associated with later stage clinical programs support increased $337 million, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed products support of $102 million and DRTS activities of $21 million. DRTS expenses included a $60 million upfront payment related to our cancer immunotherapy collaboration with Kite Pharma, Inc.The increase in R&D expense for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase of $665 million in our later stage clinical programs, including evolocumab and Kyprolis®; and an increase of $96 million in DRTS activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed products support of $58 million.Selling, general and administrativeSG&A expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; the BPD fee; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. SG&A expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery.The decrease in SG&A expense for 2014 was driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL profit share in October 2013, which reduced expenses by $818 million. That decline was offset partially by the addition of $183 million as a result of the Onyx acquisition, an additional $129 million accrual for the BPD fee as the final regulations accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year and increased commercial expenses of $109 million in preparation for new product launches. Historically, under our ENBREL collaboration agreement, we paid Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada on a scale that increased with gross profits. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired on October 31, 2013, and we are required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada. The royalty percentage was 12% through October 31, 2014, declining to 11% through October 31, 2015 and 10% through October 31, 2016.The increase in SG&A expense for 2013 was driven primarily by the addition of Onyx of $276 million, of which $215 million was acquisition-related. Included in these costs are advisory, legal and regulatory costs, and compensation-related payments. The compensation payments include cash payments for accelerated vesting of equity awards as part of the acquisition that were previously granted under the Onyx equity award programs which would not have otherwise vested. SG&A also increased by $98 million related primarily to favorable changes in 2012 to the estimated BPD fee.OtherOther operating expenses for 2014 included certain charges related to our restructuring plan, primarily separation costs of $377 million. It also included a $46 million write-off of a non-key IPR&D program acquired in a prior year business combination.Other operating expenses for 2013 included $113 million of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex) business combination, certain charges related to our other cost savings initiatives of $71 million, which included severance expenses, and $12 million of other charges related primarily to legal proceedings.Other operating expenses for 2012 included charges of $175 million related to our other cost savings initiatives, which included severance and expenses associated with abandoning leased facilities, legal charges of $64 million and other operating expenses of $56 million, comprised primarily of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex business combination.Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Years ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012Interest expense, net$1,071 $1,022 $1,053Interest and other income, net$465 $420 $485Provision for income taxes$427 $184 $664Effective tax rate7.6% 3.5% 13.3%50Interest expense, netThe increase in interest expense, net in 2014 was due primarily to a higher average balance of debt outstanding offset partially by lower average borrowing rates compared with 2013. The decrease in interest expense, net in 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to the decrease in non-cash interest resulting from the settlement of our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes in February 2013 offset partially by increases resulting from the higher average balance of other outstanding debt and financing fees paid in association with the acquisition of Onyx.Interest and other income, netThe increase in interest and other income, net for 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to interest earned as a result of a higher average balance of cash and investments offset partially by a reduction in income realized from the sale of investments recognized in 2014. The decrease in interest and other income, net for 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to a reduction in income from the sale of investments recognized in 2013.Income taxesThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to two significant events that occurred during 2013. First, the settlement of our examination with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, in which we agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS and remeasured our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) accordingly, resulting in a benefit of approximately $185 million. Second, because the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was not enacted until 2013, certain provisions of the Act benefiting the Company's 2012 federal taxes, including the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2012, were not recognized in the Company's 2012 financial results and instead are reflected in the Company's 2013 financial results. Therefore, our effective tax rate for 2013 included an additional $70 million benefit for the full-year 2012 R&D tax credit. The increase was offset partially by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses due primarily to higher domestic acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs in 2014.The decrease in our effective rate for 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to three significant events occurring in 2013: (i) we settled our examination with the IRS for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, as discussed above; (ii) costs associated with the acquisition of Onyx, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $180 million; and (iii) the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 and 2013, as discussed above. Additionally, our rate was further reduced by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses.The effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 would have been approximately 12.8%, 9.2%, and 18.7%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax.As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States.See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies—Income taxes and Part IV—Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2014 2013Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$27,026 $19,401Restricted investments— 3,412 Total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments$27,026 $22,813Total assets69,009 66,125Current portion of long-term debt500 2,505Long-term debt30,215 29,623Stockholders’ equity25,778 22,096The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividends and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. 51Whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will repurchase stock). The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.36 per share of common stock in 2012, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 31% to $0.47 per share of common stock in 2013 and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 30% to $0.61 per share of common stock in 2014. In December 2014, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.79 per share of common stock, an increase of 30%, to be paid in March 2015.The Company has also returned capital to stockholders through its stock repurchase program. During 2012, we spent $4.6 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock, and an additional $832 million during the first quarter of 2013, after which repurchases were temporarily suspended. In October 2014, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the stock repurchase program that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available. We reinitiated repurchasing activity under the program and, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased $153 million of stock, of which $138 million was paid in cash by December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, $3.8 billion remains available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as “U.S. funds”) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $223 million and $419 million, respectively. Of these receivables, $124 million and $301 million were past due as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securitiesOf our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $27.0 billion as of December 31, 2014, approximately $25.7 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Financing arrangementsThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2014, were $0.5 billion and $30.2 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2013, were $2.5 billion and $29.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (Moody's) and Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB with a negative outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to 52these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings and would affect the interest rate paid under our Term Loan Credit Facility.During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we issued long-term debt with aggregate principal amounts of $4.5 billion, $8.1 billion, and $5.0 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we repaid debt of $5.6 billion, $3.4 billion, and $123 million, respectively. For information regarding specific issuances and repayments of debt, see Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges. In 2014 and 2013, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.25 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. In addition, we previously had interest rate swap contracts on debt with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion which, due to historically low interest rates, were terminated in May 2012. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts.To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion. See Part IV—Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2014, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.In July 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. This agreement amended and restated our previous revolving credit agreement on substantially similar terms. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.In February 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC which allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2017.In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2014.See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements.53Cash flowsA summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012Net cash provided by operating activities$8,555 $6,291 $5,882Net cash used in investing activities(5,752) (8,469) (9,990)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities(2,877) 2,726 419OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2014 due primarily to higher revenues, higher operating income, including the impact of the expiration of the ENBREL co-promotion term on October 31, 2013, and improvements in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2013 due primarily to the 2012 impacts of the payment associated with a legal settlement and higher payments to taxing authorities, offset partially by cash receipts in 2012 of $397 million in connection with the termination of interest rate swap agreements and $197 million received under a government-funded program in Spain with regard to trade receivables.InvestingCapital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland, as well as other site developments, totaled $718 million, $693 million and $689 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We currently estimate 2015 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $800 million.Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $165 million, $9.4 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, $285 million was used to purchase intangible assets.Net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments used $4.4 billion for 2014 and provided $1.7 billion for 2013. Net purchases of marketable securities totaled $6.9 billion for 2012.FinancingCash used in financing activities during 2014 was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $5.6 billion, the payment of dividends of $1.9 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $138 million. These payments were offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.5 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $186 million. Cash provided by financing activities during 2013 was due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $8.1 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $296 million. These receipts were offset partially by the repayment of long-term debt of $3.4 billion, the payment of dividends of $1.4 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $832 million. Cash used in financing activities during 2012 was due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.9 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $1.3 billion, offset partially by repurchases of common stock of $4.6 billion and the payment of dividends of $1.1 billion. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.Contractual ObligationsContractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.54The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period as of December 31, 2014 Year Years Years YearsContractual obligationsTotal 1 2 and 3 4 and 5 6 and beyondLong-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4)$48,262 $1,611 $8,985 $9,579 $28,087Operating lease obligations1,034 135 323 282 294Purchase obligations (5)3,398 1,377 811 401 809UTBs (6)— — — — —Total contractual obligations$52,694 $3,123 $10,119 $10,262 $29,190(1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments which are included in our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2014, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net increase in future interest payments of $272 million. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts.(2) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments under our Term Loan at LIBOR-based variable rates of interest. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2014, in computing interest payments on this debt obligation. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this debt obligation.(3) Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IV—Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts.(4) Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2014. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations.(5) Purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business; and (iv) a $225 million payment due to the former shareholders of Proteolix, Inc. in settlement of contingent consideration assumed in the acquisition of Onyx (see Note 16, Fair value measurement to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.(6) Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2014, are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities.In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisition of BioVex. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2014, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $3.0 billion, including $450 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. See Part IV—Note 16, Fair value measurement to the Consolidated Financial Statements.55Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.Product sales and sales deductionsRevenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, “sales deductions”) and returns, which are established at the time of sale.We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions TotalBalance as of January 1, 2012$1,047 $199 $80 $1,326Amounts charged against product sales1,480 2,709 659 4,848Payments(1,680) (2,741) (624) (5,045)Balance as of December 31, 2012847 167 115 1,129Amounts charged against product sales1,784 3,008 669 5,461Payments(1,736) (2,924) (682) (5,342)Balance as of December 31, 2013895 251 102 1,248Amounts charged against product sales2,499 3,399 688 6,586Payments(2,274) (3,454) (727) (6,455)Balance as of December 31, 2014$1,120 $196 $63 $1,379For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, total sales deductions were 25%, 23% and 23% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent 3% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2014.In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold.Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid by us based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which can take more than one year. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. For example, we had managed Medicaid rebate adjustments of $164 million in 2013. Changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods were less than 2% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, and less than 10% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, including the aforementioned adjustment. A 10% change in our rebate estimate attributable 56to rebates recognized in 2014 would have had an impact of approximately $250 million, or approximately 1% of our 2014 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity.Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.Product returnsReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the last three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant.Income taxesThe Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.Certain items are included in the Company's tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.The Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Company’s pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Company’s operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020.Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Company’s foreign income associated with the Company’s operations conducted in Puerto Rico.If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results.57Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Part IV—Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies.While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinationsWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:•determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;•projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;•estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and•developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of various contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses (see Part IV—Note 3, Business combinations, and Note 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.Impairment of long-lived assetsWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value.58Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility, are reviewed annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2014 and 2013. We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsOur portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities at December 31, 2014 and 2013, was comprised of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest-bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $26.6 billion and $22.3 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2014 and 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these securities of approximately $700 million and $470 million, respectively, on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2014 and 2013, would not result in a material effect on income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year.As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $30.7 billion and a fair value of $33.6 billion. As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $32.1 billion and a fair value of $33.5 billion. Our outstanding debt was comprised primarily of debt with fixed interest rates as the carrying value of variable rate debt was $5.2 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2014, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.5 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.2 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts.To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts during 2014 and 2013, which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These derivative contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $6.65 billion and $4.4 billion were outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2014 and 2013 would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $350 million and $300 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing years. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that 59hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion that hedge certain of our foreign currency denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros/pounds sterling and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2014 and 2013, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $260 million and $320 million, respectively, but would have no material effect on cash flows or income in the respective ensuing year.Foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2014, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $740 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $660 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $750 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $730 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt.With regard to our $2.7 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros and pound sterling as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $610 million and $660 million, respectively on these dates, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the respective ensuing years. The impact on income in the ensuing years from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2014, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.8 billion and $271 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $4.0 billion and $516 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, the net unrealized gain on these contracts was approximately $360 million. As of December 31, 2013, the net unrealized loss on these contracts was not material. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2014, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2014, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $700 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $380 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2013, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $820 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $400 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.60As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $875 million and $999 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2014 and 2013. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2014 and 2013, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in a reduction of approximately $80 million and $160 million, respectively, in the fair value of these contracts on this date, but would not result in a material effect on income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Market price sensitive financial instrumentsAs of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, was not material.Counterparty credit risksOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S&P, Moody's or Fitch and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.",2023-12-30 18:05:21.556771

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.Forward-looking statementsThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume,” and “continue,” as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made.

This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people’s lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world’s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.Our principal products include ENBREL, Neulasta®, Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, Sensipar®/Mimpara®, XGEVA®, Prolia® and NEUPOGEN®. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.In 2015, we advanced our strategy, by delivering strong financial performance across the business, advancing our innovative pipeline and branded biosimilar programs, developing improved biologic drug delivery systems, transforming our business to a more focused operating model and returning capital to shareholders.•Financial performance was strong, as total revenues and product sales increased 8% driven by strong performance across the portfolio except EPOGEN® and NEUPOGEN® which both decreased by 9%. Net income and diluted EPS increased by 35%, driven by higher total revenue and lower operating expenses. Cash flows from operating activities grew 6% to $9.1 billion, driven by higher operating income, enabling us to grow the business and invest for the future.•Our progress can also be seen in six innovative new launches - four in oncology and two in cardiovascular disease. For example, we continued to expand indications for our products, including for Kyprolis® , which is now the only approved therapy for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with proven efficacy as a single agent, doublet or triplet combination, that is offered in a variety of doses to meet individual patient needs.•Our pipeline continues to advance with the recent regulatory submissions for Parsabiv™, positive phase 3 data for romosozumab (in collaboration with UCB), phase 2 data for AMG 334 (in collaboration with Novartis) and phase 2b data for omecamtiv mecarbil (in collaboration with Cytokinetics). In 2015, we also continued to advance our biosimilar program, including the filing for global regulatory approval for ABP 501, biosimilar adalimumab (HUMIRA®) and phase 3 data for ABP 215, biosimilar bevacizumab (Avastin®).39•We continue to innovate with patient- and provider-friendly delivery systems to differentiate our products. The Neulasta® Onpro™ kit was approved by the FDA at the end of 2014 and now represents approximately one fourth of our U.S. Neulasta® business. We also submitted applications to regulators, including the FDA and EMA, for a single-dosing option for the monthly administration of Repatha®.•In 2015, we continued to execute the transformation and process improvement efforts announced in 2014. As part of these efforts, we committed to a more focused operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company have enabled us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities to deliver value to patients and shareholders.•Finally, we continued returning capital to shareholders in 2015 through the payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We paid dividends of $0.79 per share of common stock in each of the four quarters of 2015, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in each of the four quarters of 2014. In December 2015, we declared a dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2016, payable in March 2016, representing a 27% increase over the quarterly dividends paid in 2015. We also repurchased 12 million shares of our common stock throughout 2015 at an aggregate cost of $1.9 billion. As of December 31, 2015, $4.9 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program.We believe that we are uniquely positioned for the opportunities arising in biology and to deliver our strategy focusing on the areas of oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience. We have near- and long-term opportunities ahead, including: (i) successfully executing on new product launches, (ii) advancing our robust pipeline with new innovative biologics and new delivery systems, (iii) the development, approval and launch of our biosimilars and (iv) advancing the next-generation manufacturing of high quality biologics. We expect our legacy products to continue to generate significant cash flows. In addition, we continue to focus on collaborating with innovators and value-creating business development activities to expand our approach to deliver significant impact for patients and advance programs where there remains high unmet medical need. Finally, we continue to expand into new geographic growth markets, enabling us to be present in over 100 countries.Our business will continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will face increasing competitive pressure as a result of competitive product launches, including from biosimilars. 2016 is the first full year we are competing without patent protection on several of our principal products in the United States. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Patents and see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition.Current global economic conditions also pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Efforts to reduce healthcare costs are being made by third-party payers including governments and private payers. In the United States, various actions have been taken aimed at reducing healthcare spending. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce our revenues or increase our expenses may be enacted. As a result of global economic conditions, as well as public and private health care provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures.Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. The discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. We must develop new products over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched, as well as in order to provide for revenue and earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.Finally, our product sales can be affected by wholesaler and end-user buying patterns. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year.See Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales.40Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2015 Change 2014Product sales: U.S.$16,523 12 % $14,732Rest of world (ROW)4,421 (4)% 4,595Total product sales20,944 8 % 19,327Other revenues718 (2)% 736Total revenues$21,662 8 % $20,063Operating expenses$13,192 (5)% $13,872Operating income$8,470 37 % $6,191Net income$6,939 35 % $5,158Diluted EPS$9.06 35 % $6.70Diluted shares766 (1)% 770In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.U.S. product sales for 2015 increased across the portfolio except for EPOGEN® and NEUPOGEN®, which declined 9% and 5%, respectively. The U.S. increase was driven primarily by increases in net selling prices. The decrease in ROW product sales for 2015 reflects unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and declines in net selling prices, offset partially by unit demand growth.The decrease in operating expenses for 2015 was driven primarily by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts, higher restructuring charges in the prior year and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, offset partially by increased support for launch products.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2015, 2014 or 2013.41Results of OperationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013ENBREL$5,364 14 % $4,688 3 % $4,551Neulasta®4,715 3 % 4,596 5 % 4,392Aranesp®1,951 1 % 1,930 1 % 1,911EPOGEN®1,856 (9)% 2,031 4 % 1,953Sensipar®/Mimpara®1,415 22 % 1,158 6 % 1,089XGEVA®1,405 15 % 1,221 20 % 1,019Prolia®1,312 27 % 1,030 38 % 744NEUPOGEN®1,049 (9)% 1,159 (17)% 1,398Other products1,877 24 % 1,514 33 % 1,135Total product sales$20,944 8 % $19,327 6 % $18,192Total U.S.$16,523 12 % $14,732 5 % $14,045Total ROW4,421 (4)% 4,595 11 % 4,147Total product sales$20,944 8 % $19,327 6 % $18,192Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part 1—Item 1.

As of the end of December 2015, the Neulasta® Onpro™ kit represents approximately one fourth of our U.S. Neulasta® business.In December 2014, the FDA granted approval of the Neulasta® Onpro™ kit which enables the healthcare provider to initiate administration of Neulasta® on the same day as chemotherapy—with delivery of the patient’s full dose of Neulasta® the day following chemotherapy administration, consistent with the Neulasta® prescribing information.The increase in global Neulasta® sales for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States. Our final material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) expired in October 2015. On December 17, 2014, Apotex, Inc. (Apotex) announced that the FDA accepted for filing its application, under the abbreviated pathway, for pegfilgrastim, a biosimilar version of Neulasta®. Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on Neulasta® sales. For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Apotex, see Part IV—Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Future Neulasta® sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013Aranesp® — U.S.$900 13 % $794 6 % $747Aranesp® — ROW1,051 (7)% 1,136 (2)% 1,164Total Aranesp®$1,951 1 %$1,930 1 % $1,911The increase in global Aranesp® sales for 2015 was driven by unit demand growth, including a shift from EPOGEN® in the United States, offset partially by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in net selling price.The increase in U.S. Aranesp® sales for 2014 was driven by an increase in net selling price and, to a lesser extent, unit demand growth. The decrease in ROW Aranesp® sales for 2014 reflects a decrease in net selling price offset partially by unit demand growth in international markets.Supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries relating to our European patent for darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp®) expire in June 2016. See Part 1, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013EPOGEN® — U.S.$1,856 (9)% $2,031 4% $1,953The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for 2015 was driven by a decline in unit demand resulting from competition and a shift in dialysis sales to Aranesp®, offset partially by an increase in net selling price. The decline in EPOGEN® sales accelerated in the second half of 2015 to 37% in the fourth quarter 2015 as compared to the fourth quarter in 2014.The increase in EPOGEN® sales for 2014 was driven by an increase in net selling price offset partially by a decline in unit demand.Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN® expired in May 2015. We face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on EPOGEN® sales. Currently, in the United States, EPOGEN® and Aranesp® compete with MIRCERA®, which Roche began selling in October 2014 and, as of May 2015, licensed commercialization rights in the United States to Galenica. Simultaneously, Galenica entered into an agreement to supply MIRCERA® to Fresenius, which provides treatment to a significant portion of U.S. dialysis patients. On December 16, 2014, Hospira, Inc. (Hospira), a subsidiary of Pfizer, 43submitted a BLA to the FDA for Retacrit™, a proposed biosimilar to EPOGEN®. For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Hospira, see Part IV—Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013Sensipar® — U.S.$1,069 34 % $796 5% $757Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW346 (4)% 362 9% 332Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$1,415 22 %$1,158 6% $1,089The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for 2015 was driven primarily by unit demand growth and an increase in net selling price in the United States. ROW Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for 2014 was driven primarily by unit demand growth and an increase in net selling price in the United States, offset partially by unfavorable changes in U.S. wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories.XGEVA® Total XGEVA® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013XGEVA® — U.S.$1,006 17% $857 12% $764XGEVA® — ROW399 10% 364 43% 255Total XGEVA®$1,405 15%$1,221 20% $1,019The increases in global XGEVA® sales for 2015 and 2014 were driven primarily by unit demand growth.Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013Prolia® — U.S.$837 34% $625 35% $462Prolia® — ROW475 17% 405 44% 282Total Prolia®$1,312 27%$1,030 38% $744The increases in global Prolia® sales for 2015 and 2014 were driven primarily by unit demand growth.NEUPOGEN® Total NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013NEUPOGEN® — U.S.$793 (5)% $839 (28)% $1,169NEUPOGEN® — ROW256 (20)% 320 40 % 229Total NEUPOGEN®$1,049 (9)%$1,159 (17)% $1,39844The decrease in global NEUPOGEN® sales for 2015 was driven by a decline in unit demand due primarily to the impact of short-acting competition in the United States.The decrease in global NEUPOGEN® sales for 2014 was driven by the $155-million order from the U.S. government in 2013. Excluding the special order, U.S. and global sales declined 17% and 7%, respectively, which reflected declines in unit demand in the United States, offset partially by the increased sales as a result of acquiring rights to filgrastim in certain international areas effective January 1, 2014.There is competition in the United States, which we expect will have a material adverse impact on future sales of NEUPOGEN®. On September 3, 2015, Sandoz announced that they launched Zarxio™, a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®, in the United States. On February 17, 2015, Apotex announced that the FDA accepted for filing its application, under the abbreviated pathway, for its biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®. For discussion of ongoing litigation, see Part IV—Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.See Part 1, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition and Part IV—Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Future NEUPOGEN® sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013Vectibix® — U.S.$204 21% $168 33 % $126Vectibix® — ROW345 2% 337 28 % 263Nplate® — U.S.317 22% 260 8 % 241Nplate® — ROW208 —% 209 12 % 186Kyprolis® — U.S.467 53% 306 * 71Kyprolis® — ROW45 80% 25 * 2Other — U.S.84 * 3 N/A —Other — ROW207 —% 206 (16)% 246Total other product sales$1,877 24% $1,514 33 % $1,135Total U.S. — other products$1,072 45% $737 68 % $438Total ROW — other products805 4% 777 11 % 697Total other product sales$1,877 24% $1,514 33 % $1,135* Change in excess of 100%45Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013Operating expenses: Cost of sales$4,227 (4)% $4,422 32 % $3,346% of product sales20.2% 22.9% 18.4%% of total revenues19.5% 22.0% 17.9%Research and development$4,070 (5)% $4,297 5 % $4,083% of product sales19.4% 22.2% 22.4%% of total revenues18.8% 21.4% 21.9%Selling, general and administrative$4,846 3 % $4,699 (9)% $5,184% of product sales23.1% 24.3% 28.5%% of total revenues22.4% 23.4% 27.8%Other$49 (89)% $454 * $196* Change in excess of 100%Transformation and process improvementDuring the second half of 2014, we announced process improvement and transformation initiatives that are enabling us to invest in continuing innovation, expand into new countries and launch new products, while improving our cost structure. This plan includes a restructuring, which is delivering cost savings and funding investments. The restructuring includes reducing our geographic footprint, as well as reducing our staff by 3,500 to 4,000, both of which allow us to reinvest and hire in our strategic areas of focus.We estimate that this restructuring plan will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million, which is less than originally expected due to better than anticipated results from the exit of two of our closed facilities. Restructuring costs to date of $672 million were incurred as of December 31, 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred restructuring costs of $114 million and $558 million, respectively. We expect that we will incur most of the remaining estimated costs in 2016 and 2017 in order to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts. Net savings were not significant in 2015 and 2014 due to the investments in new product launch preparations, later stage clinical programs and external business development.Additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Part IV—Note 2, Restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 19.5% of total revenues for 2015, driven primarily by lower royalties, higher net selling prices, manufacturing efficiencies and lower costs related to our restructuring plan. The year ended December 31, 2014, also had a $99-million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014.Cost of sales increased to 22.0% of total revenues for 2014, driven by acquisition-related expenses that included an increase of $642 million of non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Onyx acquisition. The year ended December 31, 2014, also included impairment and accelerated depreciation charges pursuant to our restructuring initiative of $104 million as well as the aforementioned $99-million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche.The excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) is recorded as a cost of sales expense. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 17.8%, 20.1% and 16.0% of total revenues for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Part IV—Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax.46Research and developmentThe Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS), (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Company’s R&D activities as set forth in the following table:Category DescriptionDRTS R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our DRTS functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development.Later stage clinical programs R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU.Marketed products R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained.R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013DRTS$997 $1,212 $1,233Later stage clinical programs1,876 2,287 1,950Marketed products1,197 798 900Total R&D expense$4,070 $4,297 $4,083The decrease in R&D expense for 2015 was driven by decreased costs associated with later stage clinical programs support of $411 million and DRTS of $215 million, offset partially by increased costs associated with marketed products support of $399 million. All categories of R&D spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan, which were offset partially by increased launch related spend in marketed products, primarily Repatha®. Prior to approval, costs related to our launch products were largely categorized as later stage clinical programs. The 2015 DRTS expenses also included up-front milestone payments related to our collaborations with Xencor, Inc. and Novartis.The increase in R&D expense for 2014 was driven primarily by increased costs of $326 million associated with Onyx across all categories of R&D spend, as well as increased costs associated with other later stage clinical program support. Overall, costs associated with later stage clinical programs support increased $337 million, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed products support of $102 million and DRTS activities of $21 million. The 2014 DRTS expenses also included a $60 million upfront payment related to our cancer immunotherapy collaboration with Kite Pharma, Inc.Selling, general and administrativeThe increase in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense for 2015 was driven primarily by new product launches offset partially by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan. 2014 also included an additional $129 million accrual for the BPD fee as the final regulations accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year.The decrease in SG&A expense for 2014 was driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL profit share in October 2013, which reduced expenses by $818 million. That decline was offset partially by the addition of $183 million as a result of the Onyx acquisition, the aforementioned additional accrual for the BPD fee and increased commercial expenses of $109 million in preparation for new product launches. Historically, under our ENBREL collaboration agreement, we paid Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada on a scale that increased with gross profits. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired on October 31, 2013, and we are required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada. The royalty percentage was 12% through October 31, 2014, declining to 11% through October 31, 2015, and 10% through October 31, 2016. Effective November 1, 2016, there will be no further royalty payments.47OtherOther operating expenses for 2015 included $91 million of charges related to legal proceedings, certain charges related to our restructuring initiatives, primarily separation costs of $49 million, $31 million of write-offs of non-key assets acquired in a prior year business combination, and $111 million of gains from the sale of assets related to our site closures.Other operating expenses for 2014 included certain charges related to our restructuring plan, primarily separation costs of $377 million. It also included a $46 million write-off of a non-key IPR&D program acquired in a prior year business combination.Other operating expenses for 2013 included $113 million of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex) business combination, certain charges related to our other cost savings initiatives of $71 million, which included severance expenses, and $12 million of other charges related primarily to legal proceedings.Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Interest expense, net$1,095 $1,071 $1,022Interest and other income, net$603 $465 $420Provision for income taxes$1,039 $427 $184Effective tax rate13.0% 7.6% 3.5%Interest expense, netThe increase in interest expense, net in 2015 compared with 2014 was due primarily to a higher average amount of fixed rate debt outstanding, offset partially by the impacts of repayment of variable rate debt. The increase in interest expense, net in 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to a higher average balance of debt outstanding, offset partially by lower average borrowing rates.Interest and other income, netThe increase in interest and other income, net for 2015 compared with 2014 was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash and investment balances with a modestly higher portfolio yield, offset partially by net losses on sales of interest bearing securities in 2015. The increase in interest and other income, net for 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to interest earned as a result of a higher average balance of cash and investments offset partially by a reduction in income realized from the sale of investments in 2014.Income taxesThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2015 compared with 2014 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and lower domestic restructuring costs in 2015.The increase in our effective tax rate for 2014 compared with 2013 is due primarily to two significant events that occurred during 2013. First, the settlement of our examination with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, in which we agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS and remeasured our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) accordingly, resulting in a benefit of approximately $185 million. Second, because the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was not enacted until 2013, certain provisions of the Act benefiting the Company’s 2012 federal taxes, including the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2012, were not recognized in the Company’s 2012 financial results and instead are reflected in the Company’s 2013 financial results. Therefore, our effective tax rate for 2013 included an additional $70 million benefit for the full-year 2012 R&D tax credit. The increase was offset partially by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses.The effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 would have been approximately 16.4%, 12.8% and 9.2%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax.As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States.See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies—Income taxes and Part IV—Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.48Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2015 2014Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$31,382 $27,026Total assets$71,576 $69,009Current portion of long-term debt$2,250 $500Long-term debt$29,306 $30,215Stockholders’ equity$28,083 $25,778We intend to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.47 per share of common stock in 2013, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 30% to $0.61 per share of common stock in 2014 and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 30% to $0.79 per share of common stock in 2015. In December 2015, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2016, an increase of 27%, to be paid in March 2016.We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the first quarter of 2013, we spent $832 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased $153 million of common stock, of which $138 million was paid in cash by December 31, 2014. During 2015, we repurchased $1.9 billion of common stock. As of December 31, 2015, $4.9 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as “U.S. funds”) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $222 million and $223 million, respectively. Of these receivables, $127 million and $124 million were past due as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.49Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securitiesOf our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $31.4 billion as of December 31, 2015, approximately $29.0 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Financing arrangementsThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2015, were $2.3 billion and $29.3 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2014, were $0.5 billion and $30.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings and would affect the interest rate paid under our Term Loan Credit Facility.During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we issued long-term debt with aggregate principal amounts of $3.5 billion, $4.5 billion, and $8.1 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we repaid debt of $2.4 billion, $5.6 billion, and $3.4 billion, respectively. For information regarding specific issuances and repayments of debt, see Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $6.65 billion. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts.To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion. See Part IV—Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2015, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.In July 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.In February 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC which allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2017.In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program.50Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2015.See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements.Cash flowsA summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Net cash provided by operating activities$9,077 $8,555 $6,291Net cash used in investing activities(5,547) (5,752) (8,469)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities(3,117) (2,877) 2,726OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2015 due primarily to improvement in our operating margin and the effective termination of foreign currency contracts that resulted in the receipt of $340 million in cash, offset by the timing of payment to vendors and cash received from customers. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2014 due primarily to higher revenues, higher operating income, including the impact of the expiration of the ENBREL co-promotion term on October 31, 2013, and improvements in working capital.InvestingCapital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland, as well as other site developments, totaled $594 million, $718 million and $693 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We currently estimate 2016 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $359 million, $165 million and $9.4 billion, respectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, $55 million and $285 million, respectively, was used to purchase intangible assets.Net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments used $4.4 billion in 2015 and 2014, and provided $1.7 billion in 2013.FinancingCash used in financing activities during 2015 was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $2.4 billion, the payment of dividends of $2.4 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $1.9 billion and the settlement of obligations incurred in connection with the acquisitions of businesses of $253 million. These payments were offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $3.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2014 was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $5.6 billion, the payment of dividends of $1.9 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $138 million. These payments were offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.5 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company’s equity award programs of $186 million. Cash provided by financing activities during 2013 was due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $8.1 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company’s equity award programs of $296 million. These receipts were offset partially by the repayment of long-term debt of $3.4 billion, the payment of dividends of $1.4 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $832 million.See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.51Contractual ObligationsContractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period as of December 31, 2015 Year Years Years YearsContractual obligationsTotal 1 2 and 3 4 and 5 6 and beyondLong-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4)$49,786 $3,440 $8,604 $7,364 $30,378Operating lease obligations749 127 224 199 199Purchase obligations (5)2,817 1,045 745 391 636UTBs (6)— — — — —Total contractual obligations$53,352 $4,612 $9,573 $7,954 $31,213(1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments which are included in our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2015, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net decrease in future interest payments of $83 million. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts.(2) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments under our Term Loan at LIBOR-based variable rates of interest. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2015, in computing interest payments on this debt obligation. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this debt obligation.(3) Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IV—Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts.(4) Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2015. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations.(5) Purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.(6) Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015, are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities.In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of Dezima Pharma B.V. (Dezima) and BioVex. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2015, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $5.0 billion, including $1.6 billion of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisitions of Dezima and BioVex. See Part IV—Note 16, Fair value measurement to the Consolidated Financial Statements.52Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.Product sales and sales deductionsRevenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, “sales deductions”) and returns, which are established at the time of sale.We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions TotalBalance as of January 1, 2013$847 $167 $115 $1,129Amounts charged against product sales1,784 3,008 669 5,461Payments(1,736) (2,924) (682) (5,342)Balance as of December 31, 2013895 251 102 1,248Amounts charged against product sales2,499 3,399 688 6,586Payments(2,274) (3,454) (727) (6,455)Balance as of December 31, 20141,120 196 63 1,379Amounts charged against product sales2,734 4,275 732 7,741Payments(2,735) (4,198) (701) (7,634)Balance as of December 31, 2015$1,119 $273 $94 $1,486For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, total sales deductions were 27%, 25% and 23% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in the amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 3% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2015.In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold.Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. For example, we had managed Medicaid rebate adjustments of $164 million in 2013. Changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods were less than 3% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and less than 10% for the year ended December 31, 2013, including the aforementioned adjustment. A 10% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2015 would 53have had an impact of approximately $270 million, or approximately 1% of our 2015 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity.Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.Product returnsReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant.Income taxesThe Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.Certain items are included in the Company’s tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.The Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Company’s pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Company’s operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020.Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Company’s foreign income associated with the Company’s operations conducted in Puerto Rico.If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results.54Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. (Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Part IV—Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies.While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinationsWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:•determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;•projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;•estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and•developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of various contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses (see Part IV—Note 3, Business combinations, and Note 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.Impairment of long-lived assetsWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value.Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility or lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever 55events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2015 and 2014. We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsOur portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was comprised of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest-bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $31.0 billion and $26.6 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2015 and 2014, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these securities of approximately $840 million and $700 million, respectively, on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2015 and 2014, would not result in a material effect on income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year.As of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $31.6 billion and a fair value of $33.1 billion. As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $30.7 billion and a fair value of $33.6 billion. Our outstanding debt was comprised primarily of debt with fixed interest rates as the carrying value of variable rate debt was $2.8 billion and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2015 and 2014, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.5 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below.To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts during 2015 and 2014, which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These derivative contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $6.65 billion were outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2015 and 2014, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $290 million and $350 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing years. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. 56As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion that hedge certain of our foreign currency denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros/pounds sterling and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2015 and 2014, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $210 million and $260 million, respectively, but would have no material effect on cash flows or income in the respective ensuing year.Foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, the carrying value and fair value of this debt denominated in foreign currencies was $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2015, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $660 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $610 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2014, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $740 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $660 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt.With regard to our $2.7 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros and pound sterling, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $610 million on each of these dates, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the respective ensuing years. The impact on income in the ensuing years from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2015, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.3 billion and $225 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.8 billion and $271 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of these contracts was approximately $140 million and $360 million, respectively. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2015, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2015, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $650 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $320 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2014, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2014, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $700 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $380 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $911 million and $875 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2015 and 2014. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2015 and 2014, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts, related income or cash flows in the 57respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Market price sensitive financial instrumentsAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, was not material.Counterparty credit risksOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.",2023-12-30 18:05:16.608490

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.Forward-looking statementsThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions.

This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people’s lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world’s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.Our strategy is to develop innovative medicines in six focused therapeutic areas that meet important unmet medical needs in addressing serious illness. We have a presence in approximately 100 countries worldwide focusing on: oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience. Our principal products include ENBREL, Neulasta®, Aranesp®, Prolia®, Sensipar®/Mimpara®, XGEVA®, EPOGEN®, and NEUPOGEN®. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.In 2016, we made substantial progress on our strategic priorities with strong execution across the business.•Over the past year, our financial performance was strong, as total revenues increased 6%. Net income increased 11% and diluted EPS increased by 13% driven by higher total revenues and continued improvement in operating leverage enabled by the transformation initiatives.•Our pipeline continued to advance with the U.S. regulatory filing for EVENITY™, approval of Parsabiv™ in the EU, and in early 2017, approval in the United States. We announced positive phase 2 and phase 3 results for erenumab for chronic and episodic migraine, respectively, and positive phase 3 results for XGEVA® for the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. We also announced positive phase 3 results for Repatha® for the treatment of coronary artery disease and in early 2017, positive top-line results in our phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes and cognitive function trials. We received new indications for KYPROLIS®, Nplate®, BLINCYTO® and ENBREL. Additionally, we continued to advance our biosimilar program, including the U.S. approval and EU regulatory submission for AMJEVITA™/ ABP 501, global regulatory submission of ABP 215, and phase 3 data for ABP 980. Throughout the course of the year, we invested in external early-stage innovation to augment our internal research efforts.•We built the foundation for long-term growth through our product launches in new parts of the world, as seen by our ability to secure 94 country product launches.•We made investments in next-generation biomanufacturing that build on our expertise in manufacturing, including our new Singapore facility for which licensure is under way. We believe that our next-generation biomanufacturing will reduce the scale and cost of making biologics while retaining a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines.41•We continue to innovate with patient- and provider-friendly delivery systems to differentiate our products, as seen by our U.S. launch of the Repatha® Pushtronex™ system, a new monthly single-dose administration option, and the continued growth of the Neulasta® OnPro® kit in the United States.•Cash flows from operating activities grew 6% to $10.4 billion, enabling us to invest for the future and return capital to shareholders, consistent with our expectations for long-term growth. We increased our dividend 27% to $1.00 per share of common stock in each of the four quarters of 2016. In December 2016, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.15 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 15% for this period, to be paid in March 2017. We also repurchased 19.7 million shares of our common stock throughout 2016 at an aggregate cost of $3.0 billion.•We have focused our business and operating model through significant transformation and process improvement efforts. Our transformation has established a foundation for longer-term growth and we are approaching the development of promising new medicines with greater understanding, speed and confidence.While 2016 execution was strong, we expect 2017 to be an increasingly challenging environment. Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products over time in order to provide for revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched. Certain of our products will face increasing pressure from competitive product launches, including from biosimilars. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents and see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.Rising healthcare costs and economic conditions also continue to pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public and private health care provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures.Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales.We believe we are well positioned for the challenges and opportunities in the coming year. Challenges and opportunities led us to begin our transformation at Amgen, which will continue to be an important part of our strategy and execution. We have enthusiasm for the future and long-term growth based on innovative medicines that make a difference for patients suffering from serious illness. We are focused on executing our strategy and delivering results.42Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2016 Change 2015Product sales: U.S.$17,325 5 % $16,523Rest of world (ROW)4,567 3 % 4,421Total product sales21,892 5 % 20,944Other revenues1,099 53 % 718Total revenues$22,991 6 % $21,662Operating expenses$13,197 — % $13,192Operating income$9,794 16 % $8,470Net income$7,722 11 % $6,939Diluted EPS$10.24 13 % $9.06Diluted shares754 (2)% 766In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.U.S. product sales for 2016 increased across the portfolio except for EPOGEN® and NEUPOGEN®, which declined by 31% and 33%, respectively. The U.S. increase was driven primarily by increases in net selling prices. The increase in ROW product sales for 2016 was driven primarily by higher unit demand from new product launches, offset by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and declines in net selling prices.Operating expenses for 2016 were flat as the savings from transformation and process improvement efforts were offset by increased support for launch products.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2016, 2015 or 2014.43Results of OperationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014ENBREL$5,965 11 % $5,364 14 % $4,688Neulasta®4,648 (1)% 4,715 3 % 4,596Aranesp®2,093 7 % 1,951 1 % 1,930Prolia®1,635 25 % 1,312 27 % 1,030Sensipar®/Mimpara®1,582 12 % 1,415 22 % 1,158XGEVA®1,529 9 % 1,405 15 % 1,221EPOGEN®1,282 (31)% 1,856 (9)% 2,031NEUPOGEN®765 (27)% 1,049 (9)% 1,159Other products2,393 27 % 1,877 24 % 1,514Total product sales$21,892 5 % $20,944 8 % $19,327Total U.S.$17,325 5 % $16,523 12 % $14,732Total ROW4,567 3 % 4,421 (4)% 4,595Total product sales$21,892 5 % $20,944 8 % $19,327Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1.

In addition, for a list of our products’ significant competitors, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014ENBREL — U.S.$5,719 12 % $5,099 16 % $4,404ENBREL — Canada246 (7)% 265 (7)% 284Total ENBREL$5,965 11 %$5,364 14 % $4,688The increases in ENBREL sales for 2016 and 2015 were driven primarily by an increase in net selling price, offset partially by the impact of competition.In 2017, we expect intensifying competition and relatively little benefit from net selling price changes.Neulasta® Total Neulasta® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014Neulasta® — U.S.$3,925 1 % $3,891 7 % $3,649Neulasta® — ROW723 (12)% 824 (13)% 947Total Neulasta®$4,648 (1)%$4,715 3 % $4,596The decrease in global Neulasta® sales for 2016 was driven primarily by lower unit demand, offset by an increase in net selling price in the United States. As of the end of December 2016, utilization of the Neulasta® Onpro® kit continues to grow in the United States.44The increase in global Neulasta® sales for 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States, offset partially by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our final material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) expired in October 2015. Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta®. Apotex, Inc. (Apotex), Sandoz and Coherus BioSciences, Inc., announced that the FDA has accepted their applications for proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®. Novartis indicated that it received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Apotex and Sandoz, see Part IV—Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, relating to our European patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) will expire in August 2017. For further information regarding our patents, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents.Future Neulasta® sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014Aranesp® — U.S.$1,082 20 % $900 13 % $794Aranesp® — ROW1,011 (4)% 1,051 (7)% 1,136Total Aranesp®$2,093 7 %$1,951 1 % $1,930The increases in global Aranesp® sales for 2016 and 2015 were driven by unit demand growth, including a shift from EPOGEN® in the United States, offset partially by a decrease in net selling price in ROW.Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014Prolia® — U.S.$1,049 25% $837 34% $625Prolia® — ROW586 23% 475 17% 405Total Prolia®$1,635 25%$1,312 27% $1,030The increases in global Prolia® sales for 2016 and 2015 were driven primarily by unit demand growth.Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014Sensipar® — U.S.$1,240 16 % $1,069 34 % $796Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW342 (1)% 346 (4)% 362Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$1,582 12 %$1,415 22 % $1,158The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States and unit demand growth.45The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for 2015 was driven primarily by unit demand growth and an increase in net selling price in the United States.

As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders.The transformation includes a restructuring plan that will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million. As of December 31, 2016, restructuring costs incurred to date were $709 million. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred restructuring costs of $37 million, $114 million and $558 million, respectively. We expect that we will incur most of the remaining estimated costs in 2017 in order to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.2 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings were not significant in 2016, 2015 and 2014 as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Part IV—Note 2, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 18.1% of total revenues for 2016, driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies.Cost of sales decreased to 19.5% of total revenues for 2015, driven primarily by lower royalties, higher net selling prices, manufacturing efficiencies and lower costs related to our restructuring plan. The year ended December 31, 2014, also had a $99 million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014.The excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) is recorded as a cost of sales expense. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 16.5%, 17.8% and 20.1% of total revenues for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Part IV—Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Research and developmentThe Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS), (2) later-stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Company’s R&D activities as set forth in the following table:Category DescriptionDRTS R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our DRTS functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development.Later-stage clinical programs R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU.Marketed products R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained.R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014DRTS$1,039 $997 $1,212Later-stage clinical programs1,054 1,876 2,287Marketed products1,747 1,197 798Total R&D expense$3,840 $4,070 $4,29748The decreases in R&D expenses for 2016 and 2015 were driven primarily by decreased costs associated with later-stage clinical programs support of $822 million and $411 million, respectively, offset partially by increased costs associated with marketed products support of $550 million and $399 million, respectively. All categories of R&D spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. The decreases were offset partially by reinvestment for the long-term benefit of the company, including increases in DRTS for up-front milestone payments related to several collaboration transactions. Prior to approval, costs related to our launch products were categorized largely as later-stage clinical programs.Selling, general and administrativeThe increase in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense for 2016 was driven primarily by further investments in product launches, offset partially by the expiration of the ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016.The increase in SG&A expense for 2015 was driven primarily by new product launches, offset partially by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan.The ENBREL co-promotion term expired in October 2013, and we were required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada. Effective November 2016, there were no further residual royalty payments. The residual royalty percentage ranged from 10% to 12% in 2014, 2015, and 2016.OtherOther operating expenses for 2016 included $105 million of charges related to legal proceedings.Other operating expenses for 2015 included $91 million of charges related to legal proceedings, certain charges related to our restructuring initiatives, including separation costs of $49 million, $31 million of write-offs of non-key assets acquired in a prior year business combination, and $111 million of gains from the sale of assets related to our site closures.Other operating expenses for 2014 included certain charges related to our restructuring plan, primarily separation costs of $377 million. It also included a $46 million write-off of a non-key IPR&D program acquired in a prior year business combination.Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Years ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014Interest expense, net$1,260 $1,095 $1,071Interest and other income, net$629 $603 $465Provision for income taxes$1,441 $1,039 $427Effective tax rate15.7% 13.0% 7.6%Interest expense, netThe increases in interest expense, net in 2016 and 2015 were due primarily to a higher average amount of debt outstanding compared with the respective prior year.Interest and other income, netThe increase in interest and other income, net for 2016 compared with 2015 was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash and investment balances in 2016, offset partially by higher gains on strategic equity investments in 2015. The increase in interest and other income, net for 2015 compared with 2014 was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash and investment balances with a modestly higher portfolio yield, offset partially by higher net losses on sales of interest bearing securities in 2015.Income taxesThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2016 compared with 2015 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, offset partially by the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based compensation payments. One aspect of the standard requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as an income tax benefit and expense in the income statement.49The increase in our effective tax rate for 2015 compared with 2014 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and lower domestic restructuring costs in 2015.The effective tax rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014 would have been approximately 18.6%, 16.4% and 12.8%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax.As permitted under GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States.See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies—Income taxes and Part IV—Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2016 2015Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$38,085 $31,382Total assets$77,626 $71,449Current portion of long-term debt$4,403 $2,247Long-term debt$30,193 $29,182Stockholders’ equity$29,875 $28,083We intend to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.61 per share of common stock in 2014, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 30% to $0.79 per share of common stock in 2015, and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 27% to $1.00 per share of common stock in 2016. In December 2016, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.15 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 15% for this period, to be paid in March 2017.We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2016 and 2015, we repurchased $3.0 billion and $1.9 billion of our common stock, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased $153 million of our common stock, of which $138 million was paid in cash by December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2016, $4.1 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively, U.S. funds) are adequate to continue meeting our U.S. obligations, including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds, for the foreseeable future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securitiesOf our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $38.1 billion as of December 31, 2016, approximately $35.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.50The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Financing arrangementsThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2016, were $4.4 billion and $30.2 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2015, were $2.2 billion and $29.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings Inc. assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings.During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we issued debt with aggregate principal amounts of $7.3 billion, $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we repaid debt of $3.7 billion, $2.4 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. For information regarding specific issuances and repayments of debt, see Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $6.65 billion. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualified and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. See Part IV—Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As of December 31, 2016, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program, although we anticipate utilizing the commercial paper program in 2017.In 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. We extended this term by one year during 2016 and may extend the term for an additional year with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 1% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.In 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires on February 23, 2017, and is expected to be renewed before its expiration date.In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under this arrangement as of December 31, 2016. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.51Cash flowsA summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014Net cash provided by operating activities$10,354 $9,731 $8,952Net cash used in investing activities$(8,658) $(5,547) $(5,752)Net cash used in financing activities$(2,599) $(3,771) $(3,274)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2016 due primarily to an improved operating margin and the timing of customer payments, offset partially by inventory build, the monetization of foreign currency forward contracts in 2015 and the timing of tax payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2015 due primarily to improvement in our operating margin and the monetization of foreign currency contracts that resulted in the receipt of $340 million in cash, offset by the timing of payments to vendors and cash received from customers.InvestingCapital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland, as well as other site developments, totaled $738 million, $594 million and $718 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We currently estimate 2017 spending on capital projects and equipment to be consistent with 2016 spend.Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $359 million and $165 million, respectively.Net cash invested in marketable securities was $7.7 billion, $4.4 billion and $5.0 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, restricted investments provided $533 million in 2014.FinancingCash used in financing activities during 2016 was due primarily to the repayment of debt of $3.7 billion, the payment of dividends of $3.0 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $3.0 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $260 million, offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $7.3 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2015 was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $2.4 billion, the payment of dividends of $2.4 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $1.9 billion, withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $401 million and the settlement of contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with the acquisition of a business of $253 million. These payments were offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $3.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2014 was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $5.6 billion, the payment of dividends of $1.9 billion, withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $225 million and repurchases of our common stock of $138 million. These payments were offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.5 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company’s equity award programs of $186 million.See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.Contractual ObligationsContractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.52The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period as of December 31, 2016 Year Years Years YearsContractual obligationsTotal 1 2 and 3 4 and 5 6 and beyondLong-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4)$57,297 $5,741 $7,009 $7,612 $36,935Operating lease obligations (5)787 156 284 231 116Purchase obligations (6)2,914 1,592 540 285 497Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (7)— — — — —Total contractual obligations$60,998 $7,489 $7,833 $8,128 $37,548(1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our fixed rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2016, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net decrease in future interest payments of $39 million. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our LIBOR-based variable rate obligations. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2016, in computing the LIBOR-based portion of interest payments on these debt obligations. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(3) Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IV—Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(4) Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2016. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(5) Operating lease obligations exclude $228 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities.(6) Purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.(7) Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2016, are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities.In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of Dezima Pharma B.V. (Dezima) and Biovex Group Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $7.5 billion, including $1.6 billion of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisitions of Dezima and BioVex. See Part IV—Note 16, Fair value measurement to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.53Product sales and sales deductionsRevenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns, which are established at the time of sale.We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions TotalBalance as of January 1, 2014$895 $251 $102 $1,248Amounts charged against product sales2,499 3,399 688 6,586Payments(2,274) (3,454) (727) (6,455)Balance as of December 31, 20141,120 196 63 1,379Amounts charged against product sales2,734 4,275 732 7,741Payments(2,735) (4,198) (701) (7,634)Balance as of December 31, 20151,119 273 94 1,486Amounts charged against product sales3,479 5,270 905 9,654Payments(3,181) (5,201) (884) (9,266)Balance as of December 31, 2016$1,417 $342 $115 $1,874For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, total sales deductions were 31%, 27% and 25% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2016.In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold.Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.54Product returnsReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant.Income taxesWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.Certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return, but have not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.We are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035.Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to our foreign income associated with our operations conducted in Puerto Rico.If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results.Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors —The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. (Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Part IV—Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies.55While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinationsWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:•determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;•projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;•estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and•developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of various contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses (see Part IV—Note 3, Business combinations, and Note 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.Impairment of long-lived assetsWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value.Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility or lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.56We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2016 and 2015. We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsOur portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities at December 31, 2016 and 2015, was composed of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest-bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $37.6 billion and $31.0 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2016 and 2015, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these securities of approximately $900 million and $840 million, respectively, on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2016 and 2015, would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year.As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $34.6 billion and a fair value of $36.5 billion. As of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $31.4 billion and a fair value of $33.1 billion. Our outstanding debt was composed primarily of debt with fixed interest rates as the carrying values of variable rate debt were $1.5 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2016 and 2015, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below.To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $6.65 billion were outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2016 and 2015, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $240 million and $290 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, that hedge certain of our foreign currency denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros/pounds sterling and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2016 and 2015, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $450 million and $210 million, respectively.Foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign 57currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $5.5 billion. As of December 31, 2015, we had euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2016, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $1.2 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $1.1 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2015, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $660 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $610 million. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt.We have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion and $2.7 billion, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $1.2 billion and $610 million on these dates, respectively. The impact on income in the ensuing years from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2016, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $608 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.3 billion and $225 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair values of these contracts were approximately $200 million and $140 million, respectively. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2016, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2016, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $650 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $300 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2015, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2015, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $650 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $320 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $666 million and $911 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2016 and 2015. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2016 and 2015, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Market price sensitive financial instrumentsAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, was not material.Counterparty credit risksOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S&P and Moody’s and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.58",2023-12-30 18:05:18.999175
318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2018,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Income taxes.We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.We currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.In late September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico. The hurricane destroyed residential and commercial buildings, agriculture, communications networks and most of Puerto Rico’s electric grid. The critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly impacted by the storm, and we have now resumed our full manufacturing operations. The restoration of electrical service on the island has been a slow process. As a result, our facility operated with electrical power from back-up diesel-powered generators through the end of 2017 and we received regular deliveries of diesel fuel under pre-arranged contracts. In January 2018, we reconnected to the Puerto Rico electric grid and began operating without the back-up generators. However, power has not been restored to the entire island, and it is possible that the electric grid may not remain stable and we may be required to resume use of our diesel generators. In addition, supplies of medical-grade oxygen and nitrogen used in biopharmaceutical manufacturing operations are limited on the island, and we have arranged deliveries of both gases from the U.S. mainland and other countries. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.While nearly all of our staff have returned to work, some of them or their families may now or in the future be without housing, access to food and clean water, electricity, healthcare, sanitation, communications services, childcare, transportation or other essentials, and for these or other reasons some of our staff may be forced or elect to temporarily or permanently relocate elsewhere on or off the island. A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility (whether due to problems with the facility itself, the infrastructure and services available on the island, the unavailability of raw materials or supplies from vendors, the unavailability of key staff or otherwise) or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.The impact of Hurricane Maria is certain to place greater stress on the island’s already challenged economy. Since June 2015, when the Governor of Puerto Rico announced that the government (including certain government entities) was unable to pay its roughly $72 billion in debt, the government’s liquidity position has continued to deteriorate and public reports indicate that the Puerto Rico government is not making certain payments with respect to its obligations. On June 30, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to provide a mechanism for Puerto Rico to restructure its debt, achieve fiscal responsibility and gain access to capital markets. PROMESA established a federal Financial Oversight and Management Board (Oversight Board) to provide fiscal oversight through the development and approval of fiscal plans and budgets for Puerto Rico and to assist in the debt restructuring. In May 2017, after negotiations with creditors were unsuccessful and an automatic stay of creditor actions expired, the Oversight Board approved and certified the filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico of a voluntary petition under Title III of PROMESA for the government of Puerto Rico, following thereafter with similar filings for certain Puerto Rico government entities. Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Given the severe conditions in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, it is expected that resolution of Puerto Rico’s outstanding debt situation through the PROMESA judicial process will be delayed pending recovery efforts. Additionally, in January 2017, the Puerto Rico government enacted the Puerto Rico Fiscal Emergency and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which, among other things, declared a state of financial emergency in Puerto Rico and authorized the Governor to designate certain services as essential services, and other services as non-essential in order to prioritize the use of available resources to satisfy Puerto Rico’s obligations. The Puerto Rico government has continued to extend the emergency period. In June 2017, the Oversight Board certified the Puerto Rico government’s budget for fiscal year 2018. In January 2018, the Puerto Rico government proposed a revised fiscal plan. The revised fiscal plan 32is subject to approval by the Oversight Board and calls for delayed and reduced payments to creditors and assumes U.S. federal disaster assistance of $35 billion.The Puerto Rico government is continuing to seek assistance from the U.S. government for disaster relief related to Hurricane Maria. In October 2017, the U.S. Congress approved a supplemental appropriation for disaster relief whereby Puerto Rico could receive a loan of up to approximately $5 billion to be used by the Puerto Rico government to provide essential services. U.S. and Puerto Rico officials are currently negotiating the terms and conditions of disaster relief loans that may be granted to Puerto Rico. In November 2017, the Governor of Puerto Rico submitted an additional request for federal disaster assistance to restore housing and rebuild a resilient power grid. It is not certain whether and what amounts will be appropriated by the U.S. Congress to assist in the hurricane recovery. In addition, the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation will no longer permit deferral of U.S. taxation on Puerto Rico earnings of U.S. companies (or their foreign subsidiaries), although these earnings generally will be taxed in the United States at a reduced 10.5% rate. Given Puerto Rico’s challenged economy and hurricane recovery needs, it may be difficult for Puerto Rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base due to competition from other foreign locations subject to a similar level of U.S. taxation, or U.S. locations due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The manufacturing sector currently contributes more than 45% of Puerto Rico’s gross domestic product, and U.S. companies with Puerto Rico operations contribute more than 33% of Puerto Rico’s revenue base.While PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, there is still a risk that Puerto Rico’s ongoing economic challenges, the effects of Hurricane Maria and the potential impact of the 2017 Tax Act could negatively affect the territorial government’s provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business, create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, and/or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales.We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, Insulet Corporation is our single source of the on-body injector for our Neulasta® Onpro® kit. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin.Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:•regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;•adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;•unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;•failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall;•a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials;•discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components; and•labor disputes or shortages, including from the effects of health emergencies and natural disasters.For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN® glass vials). We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, clinical trial delays, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. These or other similar events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product use and sales and our business and results of operations. Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently are involved in the manufacture of many of our products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use 33contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. See Item 1. Business—Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials—Manufacturing. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by:•capacity of manufacturing facilities;•contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;•natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;•labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies or natural disasters;•compliance with regulatory requirements;•changes in forecasts of future demand;•timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields;•updates of manufacturing specifications;•contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers;•timing and outcome of product quality testing;•power failures and/or other utility failures; and/or•breakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment.If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. From time to time we have initiated voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, in July 2014, we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp® lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license another manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. We are in the process of commercially validating and licensing a second facility at our site in Singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for KYPROLIS®. If we are unable to obtain needed licenses for this facility on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned risk mitigation and cost reductions which, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if authorities restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, contract disputes, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats.34Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively impact our business.Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN®, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and accounts for approximately 70% of all EPOGEN® sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. The concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively impacting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competitive products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. Further, if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all, it could negatively impact our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions.We seek innovation through significant investment in both internal R&D and external transactions including collaborations, partnering, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions (acquisition activity). We have an ongoing process of evaluating such potential acquisition activity opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint, product offerings and/or our R&D pipeline. Acquisitions or similar arrangements may be complex, time consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may result in the diversion of our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may pay substantial amounts of cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities, which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders, respectively. Failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire (including their technology, compliance programs, distribution and general business operations and procedures), while preserving important R&D, distribution, marketing, promotion and other relationships, may affect our ability to grow and may result in our incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets.As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our products in new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including sovereign debt issues and/or the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions. As we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets. See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and/or evolving legal and regulatory environments. These legal and operational challenges along with government controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products may result in a material adverse impact on our international product sales, business and results of operations.Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. See Part IV—Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in 35costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management’s attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products.We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the United States and around the world. Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act. As we announced on December 19, 2012, we finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices. In connection with that settlement, we have been operating under a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that requires us to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations until December 2017. The corporate integrity agreement also provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on our compliance program. Certain of the corporate integrity agreement’s reporting obligations to OIG continue into 2018. While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement, failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and our being excluded from government healthcare programs. We may see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems and network-connected control systems and our data, interrupt the operation of our business and affect our reputation. To achieve our business objectives, we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network-connected control systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties. Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business, result in significant costs and/or affect our reputation.Our information technology systems are highly integrated into our business, including our R&D efforts, our clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and our product sales and distribution processes. The complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions. Our systems are also subject to frequent cyberattacks. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Such attacks could include the use of key loggers or other harmful and virulent malware, including ransomware or other denials of service, and can be deployed through malicious websites, the use of social engineering and/or other means. Attacks such as those recently seen with other multi-national companies, including some of our peers, could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access important data needed to operate our business, including developing, gaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing, selling and distributing our products. For example, in 2017, Merck experienced a cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted its operations, including the production of some of its medicines and vaccines. Our systems also contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory information, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials or personal information belonging to us, our staff, our patients, customers and/or other business partners. In some cases, we utilize third-party service providers to manage or transmit such data, which may increase our risk. Intentional or inadvertent data privacy or security breaches (including cyberattacks) by employees, service providers, nation states, organized crime organizations, “hacktivists” or others, pose risks that our sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons, our competitors, or the public. Finally, domestic and global government regulators, our key business partners, suppliers with whom we do business, companies that provide us or our partners with important business services and companies we may acquire may face similar risks, and security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security, leave us without access to important systems, products, raw materials, components, services or information or expose our confidential data. For example, we distribute our products in the United States primarily through three pharmaceutical wholesalers, and a security breach that impairs the distribution operations of our wholesalers could significantly impair our ability to deliver our products to healthcare providers. Although in the past we have experienced system breakdowns, attacks and information security breaches, we do not believe such breakdowns, attacks and breaches have had a material adverse effect on our operations. We continue to invest in the monitoring, protection, and resilience of our critical or sensitive data and systems. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks, or breaches of our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive data, which could result in 36financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us or impact our stock price. While we maintain cyber-liability insurance, our insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses that could potentially result from a service interruption, breach of our systems or loss of our critical or sensitive data.Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. Financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients’ ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors’, customers’ and suppliers’ financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments.Our stock price is volatile.Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Announcements or discussions of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would impact our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. Similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid impact on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially impacted.We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We expect to access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.Item 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.37Item 2.PROPERTIESAs of December 31, 2017, we owned or leased approximately 180 properties. The locations and primary functions of significant properties are summarized in the following tables:Excluded from the tables above are (i) undeveloped land and leased properties that have been abandoned and (ii) certain buildings that we still own but are no longer used in our business. There are no material encumbrances on our owned properties.We believe that our facilities are suitable for their intended uses and, in conjunction with our third-party contracting manufacturing agreements, provide adequate capacity and are sufficient to meet our expected needs.

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.Forward-looking statementsThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume,” and “continue,” as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (EPS), liquidity and capital resources, trends, planned dividends, stock repurchases and restructuring plans.

A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world’s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.Our principal products (those products with the most significant annual commercial sales) include ENBREL, Neulasta®, Aranesp®, Prolia®, Sensipar®/Mimpara®, XGEVA® and EPOGEN®. We also market a number of other products, including KYPROLIS®, Vectibix®, Nplate®, NEUPOGEN®, Repatha®, BLINCYTO®, IMLYGIC®, Corlanor® and Parsabiv™. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.Six therapeutic areas form the core of our business—oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience. Our strategy to execute in these therapeutic areas is multifaceted as we engage in a series of integrated activities to strengthen our competitive position in the industry focused on seven strategic priorities:In 2017, we made substantial progress on our strategic priorities.•Our innovative pipeline continued to advance with the addition of cardiovascular outcomes data to the Repatha® label in the United States. The FDA also approved Parsabiv™ for secondary hyperparathyroidism in hemodialysis patients and Vectibix®, in combination with chemotherapy, for use in wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer, and expanded the BLINCYTO® indication to include the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in adults and children. We submitted the U.S. regulatory filing for Aimovig™ for the prevention of migraine in patients experiencing four or more migraines per month. We also made U.S. and EU regulatory filings to include overall survival data in the KYPROLIS® label for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients and to expand the XGEVA® indication to include the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. We announced positive phase 3 results for a weekly regimen of KYPROLIS® for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and positive phase 2b results with tezepelumab, which has now advanced into Phase 3 for the treatment of severe, uncontrolled asthma. Throughout the course of the year, we invested in external early-stage innovation to augment our internal research efforts.•Our biosimilars also continued to advance as the FDA approved MVASI™ for the treatment of five types of cancer, and the EC approved AMGEVITA™ for the treatment of certain inflammatory diseases. We also gained clarity on the launch timing of AMGEVITA™, which is now expected in Europe later this year and we submitted U.S. and EU regulatory filings for ABP 980.•We continued to build the foundation for long-term growth through our product launches in new parts of the world, as seen by our ability to secure 80 country product launches, leveraging our global presence to deliver the potential of our products to patients.44•We continued to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines for patients around the world while responding to natural disasters and investing for the future.–In September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico. The hurricane caused widespread damage to the island, however, the critical manufacturing areas of our site in Juncos were not significantly impacted and we have resumed our full manufacturing operations. –We made investments in next-generation biomanufacturing that build on our expertise in human biology and protein manufacturing. This next-generation biomanufacturing dramatically reduces the scale and costs of making biologics while retaining a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines. In 2017, our new Singapore facility that uses our next-generation biomanufacturing technology was approved for certain commercial production by multiple regulatory agencies, including the FDA and the EMA. •We continued to innovate with delivery systems to differentiate our products, as seen by our development of the AutoTouch™ reusable auto-injector to be used with Enbrel Mini™ single-dose prefilled cartridges (50 mg/mL), which was approved by the FDA in September 2017. This device was ergonomically designed to meet the needs of rheumatoid arthritis patients. We also launched our Repatha® automated mini-doser with pre-filled cartridge in Europe. This hands-free device provides Repatha® in a single injection for administration monthly. Further, the use of the Neulasta® Onpro® On-body Injector continues to increase, exiting 2017 with over 60% share of Neulasta® sales.•Cash flows from operating activities grew 8% to $11.2 billion, enabling us to invest for the future and return capital to shareholders, consistent with our expectations for long-term growth. We increased our dividend 15% to $1.15 per share of common stock in each of the four quarters of 2017. In December 2017, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.32 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 15% for this period, to be paid in March 2018. We also repurchased 18.5 million shares of our common stock throughout 2017 at an aggregate cost of $3.1 billion.•We further optimized our business and operating model through significant transformation and process improvement efforts. Our transformation has established a foundation for growth and we are approaching the development of promising new medicines with greater understanding, speed and confidence.Our 2017 financial results also reflect the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. We now have global access to our $41.7 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which unlocks additional financial flexibility.While 2017 execution was strong, we expect 2018 will be another important year as we continue to invest in the pipeline, build our global business and support new product growth. In preparation for 2018, we expanded our transformation activities and savings initiatives to enable investment in new products and the defense of existing products to optimize long- and short-term growth. Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products over time in order to provide for revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched. Certain of our products will face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents and see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.Rising healthcare costs and economic conditions also continue to pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public and private health care provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures.Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales.45Selected Financial InformationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016Product sales: U.S.$17,131 (1)% $17,325Rest of world (ROW)4,664 2 % 4,567Total product sales21,795 — % 21,892Other revenues1,054 (4)% 1,099Total revenues$22,849 (1)% $22,991Operating expenses$12,876 (2)% $13,197Operating income$9,973 2 % $9,794Net income$1,979 (74)% $7,722Diluted EPS$2.69 (74)% $10.24Diluted shares735 (3)% 754In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.Total product sales for 2017 decreased slightly as a decline in U.S. product sales was offset partially by an increase in ROW product sales. The U.S. decrease was driven primarily by lower unit demand resulting from competition, offset partially by increases in net selling prices and favorable changes in inventory. The increase in ROW product sales for 2017 was driven primarily by higher unit demand, offset partially by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and declines in net selling prices.Operating expenses for 2017 decreased 2%. All expense categories benefited from savings resulting from our transformation and process improvement efforts. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2017, 2016 or 2015.46Results of OperationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015ENBREL$5,433 (9)% $5,965 11 % $5,364Neulasta®4,534 (2)% 4,648 (1)% 4,715Aranesp®2,053 (2)% 2,093 7 % 1,951Prolia®1,968 20 % 1,635 25 % 1,312Sensipar®/Mimpara®1,718 9 % 1,582 12 % 1,415XGEVA®1,575 3 % 1,529 9 % 1,405EPOGEN®1,096 (15)% 1,282 (31)% 1,856Other products3,418 8 % 3,158 8 % 2,926Total product sales$21,795 — % $21,892 5 % $20,944Total U.S.$17,131 (1)% $17,325 5 % $16,523Total ROW4,664 2 % 4,567 3 % 4,421Total product sales$21,795 — % $21,892 5 % $20,944Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1.

For 2018, we expect the trends of lower unit demand and net selling price to continue.The increase in ENBREL sales for 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price, offset partially by the impact of competition.Neulasta® Total Neulasta® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015Neulasta® — U.S.$3,931 — % $3,925 1 % $3,891Neulasta® — ROW603 (17)% 723 (12)% 824Total Neulasta®$4,534 (2)%$4,648 (1)% $4,715The decreases in global Neulasta® sales for 2017 and 2016 were driven primarily by lower unit demand, offset partially by an increase in net selling price in the United States. As of the end of December 2017, utilization of the Neulasta® Onpro® kit continues to grow in the United States.47 Our final material U.S. patent for Neulasta® expired in October 2015. Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta®. Multiple companies have announced applications to the FDA for proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®. While a number of these companies have announced receipt of Complete Response Letters from the FDA regarding their applications, certain of these companies may receive approval in 2018. For discussion of ongoing patent litigations with these and other companies developing proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®, see Part IV—Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, relating to our European patent for Neulasta® expired in August 2017. For further information regarding our patents, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents.Neulasta® sales have been and will continue to be impacted by the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new treatment alternatives that have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of myelosuppressive regimens in some patients.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015Aranesp® — U.S.$1,114 3 % $1,082 20 % $900Aranesp® — ROW939 (7)% 1,011 (4)% 1,051Total Aranesp®$2,053 (2)%$2,093 7 % $1,951The decrease in global Aranesp® sales for 2017 was driven primarily by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, offset partially by higher unit demand, including a shift of some U.S. dialysis centers from EPOGEN®.The increase in global Aranesp® sales for 2016 was driven primarily by higher unit demand, including a shift of some U.S. dialysis centers from EPOGEN®, offset partially by a decrease in net selling price in ROW.For 2018, we expect Aranesp® to face increasing competition from branded products. We could also face competition from biosimilar versions of EPOGEN® in 2018 if they launch in the United States. Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015Prolia® — U.S.$1,272 21% $1,049 25% $837Prolia® — ROW696 19% 586 23% 475Total Prolia®$1,968 20%$1,635 25% $1,312The increases in global Prolia® sales for 2017 and 2016 were driven primarily by higher unit demand.Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016 Change Year ended December 31, 2015Sensipar® — U.S.$1,374 11% $1,240 16 % $1,069Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW344 1% 342 (1)% 346Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$1,718 9%$1,582 12 % $1,415The increases in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for 2017 and 2016 were driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States and, to a lesser extent, higher unit demand.48Our U.S. composition of matter patent relating to Sensipar®, a small molecule, expires in March 2018. We are also involved in a number of litigation matters relating to Sensipar®, including patent litigations with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar® and litigation regarding our request for pediatric exclusivity for Sensipar®.

As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders.The transformation includes a restructuring plan that we continue to estimate will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $825 million to $900 million. As of December 31, 2017, restructuring costs incurred to date were $797 million. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred restructuring costs of $88 million, $37 million and $114 million, respectively. We expect that we will incur most of the remaining estimated costs in 2018 in order to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.5 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings have not been significant as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Part IV—Note 2, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Puerto Rico operationsIn September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico. The hurricane caused widespread damage to the island and some damage to our facility in Juncos. Critical manufacturing areas of our facility were not significantly affected, and we have resumed our full manufacturing operations. Further recovery efforts on the island are ongoing. We have continued to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines for patients around the world. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.We incurred $146 million of pre-tax expenses in 2017 related to Hurricane Maria. At this time, we do not expect significant pre-tax expenses in 2018. Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 17.8% of total revenues for 2017, driven primarily by lower amortization of intangible assets, lower royalties and favorable manufacturing costs, offset partially by expenses related to Hurricane Maria, unfavorable product mix and other inventory costs. Cost of sales decreased to 18.1% of total revenues for 2016, driven primarily by certain manufacturing efficiencies.Research and developmentThe Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS), (2) later-stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Company’s R&D activities as set forth in the following table:Category DescriptionDRTS R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our DRTS functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development.Later-stage clinical programs R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU.Marketed products R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained.51R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015DRTS$972 $1,039 $997Later-stage clinical programs879 1,054 1,876Marketed products1,711 1,747 1,197Total R&D expense$3,562 $3,840 $4,070The decrease in R&D expenses for 2017 was driven by decreased costs associated with later-stage clinical program support, lower external business development expense in DRTS and lower marketed-product support. All categories of R&D spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts and we continue to advance our pipeline. The decrease in R&D expenses for 2016 was driven primarily by decreased costs associated with later-stage clinical programs support of $822 million, offset partially by increased costs associated with marketed-products support of $550 million. All categories of R&D spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. The decrease was offset partially by reinvestment for the long-term benefit of the company, including an increase in DRTS for up-front milestone payments related to several collaboration transactions. Prior to approval, costs related to our launch products were categorized largely as later-stage clinical programs.Selling, general and administrativeThe decrease in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense for 2017 was driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016, offset partially by investments in product launch and marketed product support. The increase in SG&A expense for 2016 was driven primarily by further investments in product launches, offset partially by the expiration of the ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016.The ENBREL co-promotion term expired in October 2013, and we were required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada. Effective November 2016, there were no further residual royalty payments. The residual royalty percentage ranged from 10% to 11% in 2016 and 2015.OtherOther operating expenses for 2017 included $284 million of net charges associated with the discontinuance of the internal development of AMG 899 and $83 million of certain net charges related to our restructuring plan. See Part IV—Note 3, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other operating expenses for 2016 included $105 million of charges related to legal proceedings.Other operating expenses for 2015 included $91 million of charges related to legal proceedings; certain charges related to our restructuring initiatives, including separation costs of $49 million; $31 million of write-offs of non-key assets acquired in a prior-year business combination; and $111 million of gains from the sale of assets related to our site closures.Non-operating expenses, income and provision for income taxesNon-operating expenses, income and provision for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Years ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015Interest expense, net$1,304 $1,260 $1,095Interest and other income, net$928 $629 $603Provision for income taxes$7,618 $1,441 $1,039Effective tax rate79.4% 15.7% 13.0%Interest expense, netThe increases in interest expense, net in 2017 and 2016 were due primarily to a higher average amount of debt outstanding compared with the respective prior year.52Interest and other income, netThe increase in interest and other income, net for 2017 compared with 2016 was due primarily to higher interest income that resulted from higher average investment balances and higher gains on strategic investments.The increase in interest and other income, net for 2016 compared with 2015 was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average investment balances in 2016, offset partially by higher gains on strategic equity investments in 2015. Income taxesThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2017 compared with 2016 was due primarily to impacts of the 2017 Tax Act, including the repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings, offset partially by the remeasurement of certain net deferred and other tax liabilities.The increase in our effective tax rate for 2016 compared with 2015 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, offset partially by the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based compensation payments. One aspect of the standard requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as an income tax benefit and expense in the income statement.On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the 2017 Tax Act that imposes a repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, implements a territorial tax system together with a current tax on certain foreign earnings and lowers the general corporate income tax rate to 21%. On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) that allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We currently are analyzing the 2017 Tax Act, and in certain areas, have made reasonable estimates of the effects on our consolidated financial statements and tax disclosures, including the amount of the repatriation tax and changes to our existing deferred tax balances.The repatriation tax is based primarily on our accumulated foreign earnings and profits that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We recorded an estimated amount for our repatriation tax liability of $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2017. We no longer reinvest our undistributed earnings of our foreign operations indefinitely outside the United States. In addition, we remeasured certain net deferred and other tax liabilities based on the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The estimated amount recorded related to the remeasurement of these balances was a net benefit of $1.2 billion. The net estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Act is $6.1 billion.We consider the key estimates on the repatriation tax, net deferred tax remeasurement and the impact on our unrealized tax benefits to be incomplete due to our continuing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. Our analysis could affect the measurement of these balances and give rise to new deferred tax assets and liabilities. Since the 2017 Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and further guidance and accounting interpretation is expected over the next 12 months, our review is still pending. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period.As previously disclosed, we received a RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. On November 29, 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised their calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution through the IRS administrative appeals process, which we believe will likely not be concluded within the next 12 months. Final resolution of the IRS audit could have a material impact on our results of consolidated operations and cash flows if not resolved favorably, however, we believe our income tax reserves are appropriately provided for all open tax years.See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies—Income taxes, and Part IV—Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.53Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2017 2016Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$41,678 $38,085Total assets$79,954 $77,626Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt$1,152 $4,403Long-term debt$34,190 $30,193Stockholders’ equity$25,241 $29,875Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesWe now have global access to our $41.7 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as we no longer reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely outside the United States. Under the 2017 Tax Act, we owe a repatriation tax on undistributed earnings generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions estimated at $7.3 billion that will be paid over eight years. See Contractual Obligations below. We will also have access to global cash generated from operations in the future.The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Capital allocationConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we will seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner and will consider several alternatives such as share repurchases, payment of cash dividends, repayment of debt, and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest. In addition to deploying our cash balances, we intend to continue to invest in our business and return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.79 per share of common stock in 2015, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 27% to $1.00 per share of common stock in 2016, and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.15 per share of common stock in 2017. In December 2017, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.32 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 15% for this period, to be paid in March 2018.We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2017, we repurchased $3.1 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $3.2 billion. In 2016 and 2015, we repurchased $3.0 billion and $1.9 billion of our common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, $4.4 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.In January 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 billion under our stock repurchase program. Based on our confidence in the long-term outlook for our business, enhanced by the 2017 Tax Act, and consistent with our ongoing objective to return capital to our stockholders, on February 5, 2018, we announced a tender offer to purchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock at a price not greater than $200 per share nor less than $175 per share. The tender offer expires at 12:00 Midnight, New York City time, at the end of Monday, March 5, 2018, unless the offer is extended.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt 54markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Financing arrangementsThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2017, were $1.2 billion and $34.2 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2016, were $4.4 billion and $30.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch) assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings.During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we issued debt with aggregate principal amounts of $4.5 billion, $7.3 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we repaid debt of $4.4 billion, $3.7 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $9.45 billion and $6.65 billion, respectively.To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualified and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion. As of December 31, 2017, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2017, we issued and repaid an aggregate of $12.3 billion commercial paper and had a maximum outstanding balance of $1.5 billion under our commercial paper program. During 2016 and 2015, we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2017 or 2016.In 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. We extended this term by one year during 2016 and may extend the term for an additional year with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 1% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.In 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2020.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under this arrangement as of December 31, 2017. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.55Cash flowsA summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015Net cash provided by operating activities$11,177 $10,354 $9,731Net cash used in investing activities$(4,024) $(8,658) $(5,547)Net cash used in financing activities$(6,594) $(2,599) $(3,771)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2017 due primarily to a higher operating margin and the timing of payments to vendors and receipts from customers, offset partially by higher payments to taxing authorities. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2016 due primarily to an improved operating margin and the timing of customer payments, offset partially by inventory build, the monetization of foreign currency forward contracts in 2015 and the timing of tax payments. InvestingCash used in investing activities during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $3.2 billion, $7.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with site development costs, including our Thousand Oaks campus, as well as manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico, Singapore and Ireland, were $664 million, $738 million and $594 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We currently estimate 2018 spending on capital projects to be approximately $750 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during 2017 was due primarily to the repayment of debt of $4.4 billion, the payment of dividends of $3.4 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $3.2 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $191 million, offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $4.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2016 was due primarily to the repayment of debt of $3.7 billion, the payment of dividends of $3.0 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $3.0 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $260 million, offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $7.3 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2015 was due primarily to the repayment of debt of $2.4 billion, the payment of dividends of $2.4 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $1.9 billion, withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $401 million and the settlement of contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with the acquisition of a business of $253 million, offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $3.5 billion. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.56The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period as of December 31, 2017Contractual obligations Total Year 1 Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 Years 6 and beyondLong-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4) $56,763 $2,530 $9,964 $9,705 $34,564Operating lease obligations (5) 650 158 242 159 91Purchase obligations (6) 1,343 605 346 150 242U.S. repatriation tax (7) 7,316 585 1,170 1,170 4,391Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (8) — — — — —Total contractual obligations $66,072 $3,878 $11,722 $11,184 $39,288(1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our fixed-rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2017, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net increase in future interest payments of $22 million. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our LIBOR-based variable-rate obligations. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2017, in computing the LIBOR-based portion of interest payments on these debt obligations. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(3) Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IV—Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(4) Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2017. See Part IV—Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(5) Operating lease obligations exclude $205 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities.(6) Purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.(7) Under the 2017 Tax Act, we will elect to pay the repatriation tax primarily related to our prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations in eight annual installments beginning April 2018. See Part IV—Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(8) Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties of $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2017, are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities.In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisition of BioVex Group Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2017, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $7.0 billion, including $325 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. Contingent consideration with respect to the acquisition of Dezima Pharma B.V. was excluded due to the discontinuation of the development of AMG 899, upon which payments are based. See Part IV—Note 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.57Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.Product sales and sales deductionsRevenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns, which are established at the time of sale.We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions TotalBalance as of December 31, 2014$1,120 $196 $63 $1,379Amounts charged against product sales2,734 4,275 732 7,741Payments(2,735) (4,198) (701) (7,634)Balance as of December 31, 20151,119 273 94 1,486Amounts charged against product sales3,479 5,270 905 9,654Payments(3,181) (5,201) (884) (9,266)Balance as of December 31, 20161,417 342 115 1,874Amounts charged against product sales4,909 6,098 992 11,999Payments(4,459) (6,168) (999) (11,626)Balance as of December 31, 2017$1,867 $272 $108 $2,247For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, total sales deductions were 35%, 31% and 27% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2017.In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold.Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price 58between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.Product returnsReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant.Income taxesWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.Certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return, but have not yet recognized the expense in the consolidated financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.We are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035.On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118 to address the accounting implications of the 2017 Tax Act. The effects of the 2017 Tax Act are recognized upon enactment, however, SAB 118 permits a company to recognize provisional amounts when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. The measurement period to finalize our calculations cannot extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Key provisions that have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and where we have recognized estimated amounts include the recognition of liabilities for taxes on repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of certain net deferred and other tax liabilities.Furthermore, the 2017 Tax Act permits a company, upon election, to pay the repatriation tax over eight years on an interest-free basis, which we expect to do. In January 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board staff issued Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 2, Whether to Discount the Tax Liability on Deemed Repatriation, which notes that the repatriation tax liability should not be discounted. See Part IV—Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries, including the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.59ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Part IV—Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies.While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinationsWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. See Part IV—Note 3, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:•determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;•projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;•estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and•developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. For example, during 2017, we discontinued the internal development of AMG 899 and consequently reduced the related contingent consideration liabilities. See Part IV—Note 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.Impairment of long-lived assetsWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value.Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility or lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the 60asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, during 2017, we discontinued the internal development of AMG 899 and consequently recorded an IPR&D asset impairment charge. See Part IV—Note 12, Goodwill and other intangible assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsOur portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, was composed of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest-bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $41.2 billion and $37.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these securities of $1.1 billion and $900 million, respectively, on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year.As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $35.3 billion and a fair value of $38.6 billion. As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $34.6 billion and a fair value of $36.5 billion. Our outstanding debt was composed primarily of debt with fixed interest rates with variable rate debt having a carrying value of $850 million and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, would have resulted in an increase of $3.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below.To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $9.45 billion and $6.65 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of $420 million and $240 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. 61As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion that hedge certain of our foreign-currency denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of $390 million and $450 million, respectively.Foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign-currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated debt with a principal carrying value and fair value of $6.2 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated debt with a principal carrying value and fair value of $5.5 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2017, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.3 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.2 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2016, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.2 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.1 billion. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt.We have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs with an aggregate notional amount of $5.6 billion, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion on these dates, respectively. The impact on income in the ensuing years from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2017, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $4.6 billion and $74 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $608 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair values of these contracts were a $200 million liability and a $200 million asset, respectively. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open as of December 31, 2017, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2017, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $930 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $360 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2016, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2016, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $650 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $300 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $757 million and $666 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.62Market price sensitive financial instrumentsAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, was not material.Counterparty credit risksOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.",2023-12-30 18:05:18.450985

A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world’s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.Our principal products—those with the most significant annual commercial sales—are ENBREL, Neulasta®, Prolia®, Aranesp®, XGEVA®, Sensipar®/Mimpara® and EPOGEN®. We also market a number of other products, including KYPROLIS®, Nplate®, Vectibix®, Repatha®, NEUPOGEN®, Parsabiv®, BLINCYTO®, Aimovig®, IMLYGIC®, Corlanor®, KANJINTITM and AMGEVITATM. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.Our strategy includes a set of integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry. In 2018, we advanced our strategy while delivering strong financial performance and returning capital to shareholders, advancing our innovative pipeline and branded biosimilar programs, increasing our global geographic reach and expanding our next-generation manufacturing capabilities. In 2018, total product sales increased 3% driven primarily by Prolia®, XGEVA®, Repatha® and KYPROLIS®, along with our recently launched products Aimovig® and Parsabiv®. Product sales grew 2% in the United States and 9% in the rest of the world. Total operating expenses increased 5% as we supported our recently launched products and R&D pipeline, including early oncology assets. Cash inflows from operating activities were $11.3 billion, enabling us to invest in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.32 per share of common stock. In December 2018, we declared a cash dividend of $1.45 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2019. We also repurchased 94.5 million shares of our common stock throughout 2018 at an aggregate cost of $17.9 billion. In addition to launching Aimovig® in the United States and Parsabiv® in the United States and the EU, we received approvals for new indications for Repatha® and Prolia®, along with KYPROLIS®, BLINCYTO®, XGEVA® and Nplate® within our oncology/hematology portfolio. We continued to strengthen our international footprint with the approvals of Repatha® in China, and in early 2019, EVENITYTM in Japan. In addition to these commercial products, we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative first-in-class molecules, including our phase 3 molecule, tezepelumab. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tezepelumab in patients with severe asthma without an eosinophilic phenotype. We have also continued to invest in external innovation to augment our internal innovation with a focus when possible, on genetic related investments and genetically validated targets. We also continued to advance our biosimilar program with the approval of MVASITM for the treatment of five types of cancer in the United States and the EU, and the launches of KANJINTITM and AMGEVITATM in Europe. Lastly, we made regulatory submissions for ABP 710 in the United States and the EU. We broke ground on our new next-generation biomanufacturing plant in Rhode Island in 2018. This new plant will be the first of its kind in the United States and will use our proven next-generation biomanufacturing capabilities to manufacture our products while maintaining a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines. Next-generation biomanufacturing plants require a smaller manufacturing footprint and offer greater environmental benefits, including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower levels of carbon emissions. Our first next-generation biomanufacturing facility located in Singapore is already in use for certain commercial-scale production for multiple countries. While 2018 execution was strong, we face competition on our more mature products. We have established productivity initiatives to enable investment in new products and the defense of existing products to optimize long- and short-term growth. Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products over time in order to provide for revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched. Certain of our products face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents and see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.Rising healthcare costs and economic conditions also continue to pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public 44and private health care provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales.Selected Financial InformationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data): Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017Product sales: U.S.$17,429 2 % $17,131Rest of world (ROW)5,104 9 % 4,664Total product sales22,533 3 % 21,795Other revenues1,214 15 % 1,054Total revenues$23,747 4 % $22,849Operating expenses$13,484 5 % $12,876Operating income$10,263 3 % $9,973Net income$8,394 * $1,979Diluted EPS$12.62 * $2.69Diluted shares665 (10)% 735* Change in excess of 100%In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers (such as physicians or their clinics), dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held at wholesaler customers and end-users (such as pharmacies).Total product sales increased for 2018, driven primarily by higher unit demand, offset partially by a decline in net selling price. For 2019, we expect net selling price to continue to decline.Other revenues increased for 2018, driven primarily by higher milestone payments and royalties.Operating expenses increased for 2018, driven primarily by investments in product launches and increased spend in R&D, including support of our early pipeline. All expense categories continued to benefit from our transformation and process improvement efforts, which enabled investment in newer and recently launched products.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2018, 2017 or 2016.45Results of OperationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016ENBREL$5,014 (8)% $5,433 (9)% $5,965Neulasta®4,475 (1)% 4,534 (2)% 4,648Prolia®2,291 16 % 1,968 20 % 1,635Aranesp®1,877 (9)% 2,053 (2)% 2,093XGEVA®1,786 13 % 1,575 3 % 1,529Sensipar®/Mimpara®1,774 3 % 1,718 9 % 1,582EPOGEN®1,010 (8)% 1,096 (15)% 1,282Other products4,306 26 % 3,418 8 % 3,158Total product sales$22,533 3 % $21,795 — % $21,892Total U.S.$17,429 2 % $17,131 (1)% $17,325Total ROW5,104 9 % 4,664 2 % 4,567Total product sales$22,533 3 % $21,795 — % $21,892Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition, in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. In addition, for a list of our products’ significant competitors, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016ENBREL — U.S.$4,807 (8)% $5,206 (9)% $5,719ENBREL — Canada207 (9)% 227 (8)% 246Total ENBREL$5,014 (8)%$5,433 (9)% $5,965The decrease in ENBREL sales for 2018 was driven primarily by lower unit demand and net selling price. The decrease in ENBREL sales for 2017 was driven primarily by lower unit demand and net selling price, offset partially by an increase in inventory. For 2019, we expect the trend of lower unit demand to continue. Multiple companies are developing proposed biosimilar versions of ENBREL, and we are involved in patent litigation with the company seeking to market the biosimilar version of ENBREL approved by the FDA in 2016. See Part IV—Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.46Neulasta® Total Neulasta® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016Neulasta® — U.S.$3,866 (2)% $3,931 — % $3,925Neulasta® — ROW609 1 % 603 (17)% 723Total Neulasta®$4,475 (1)%$4,534 (2)% $4,648The decrease in global Neulasta® sales for 2018 was driven primarily by favorable changes in accounting estimates of product returns in 2017, offset partially by favorable changes in inventory. Neulasta® sales for 2018 included a $55 million order in the fourth quarter from the U.S. government. The decrease in global Neulasta® sales for 2017 was driven primarily by lower unit demand, offset partially by an increase in net selling price in the United States. Neulasta® sales have been and will continue to be affected by the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new treatment alternatives, including those that have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of myelosuppressive regimens in some patients.Our final material U.S. patent for Neulasta® expired in October 2015. Therefore, we face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta®. A biosimilar version of Neulasta® was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and launched in July 2018, and another biosimilar version was approved in the fourth quarter of 2018 and launched in January 2019. Other biosimilar versions of Neulasta® may also receive approval in the near future. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigations with these and other companies that are developing proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta®, see Part IV—Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, that are related to our European patent for Neulasta® expired in August 2017. In 2019, we expect European sales to decline with the launch of multiple long-acting biosimilar competitors.Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016Prolia® — U.S.$1,500 18% $1,272 21% $1,049Prolia® — ROW791 14% 696 19% 586Total Prolia®$2,291 16% $1,968 20% $1,635The increases in global Prolia® sales for 2018 and 2017 were driven primarily by higher unit demand.Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016Aranesp® — U.S.$942 (15)% $1,114 3 % $1,082Aranesp® — ROW935 — % 939 (7)% 1,011Total Aranesp®$1,877 (9)%$2,053 (2)% $2,093The decrease in global Aranesp® sales for 2018 was driven primarily by the impact of competition on unit demand.The decrease in global Aranesp® sales for 2017 was driven primarily by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, offset partially by higher unit demand, including a shift of some U.S. dialysis centers from EPOGEN®.47Aranesp® faces competition from a long-acting product. Aranesp® also faces competition from a biosimilar version of EPOGEN®, which was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and launched in the fourth quarter of 2018. Other biosimilar versions of EPOGEN ® may also receive approval. In 2019, we expect sales in the United States to decline at a faster rate than 2018 due to short- and long- acting competition. XGEVA® Total XGEVA® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016XGEVA® — U.S.$1,338 16% $1,157 4% $1,115XGEVA® — ROW448 7% 418 1% 414Total XGEVA®$1,786 13% $1,575 3% $1,529The increases in global XGEVA® sales for 2018 and 2017 were driven primarily by higher unit demand.Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016Sensipar® — U.S.$1,436 5 % $1,374 11% $1,240Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW338 (2)% 344 1% 342Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$1,774 3 %$1,718 9% $1,582The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for 2018 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States, offset partially by lower unit demand. The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for 2017 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States and, to a lesser extent, higher unit demand.Our U.S. composition of matter patent related to Sensipar®, a small molecule, expired in March 2018. We are involved in patent litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar®, one of which began selling its generic version in late December 2018 until reaching a settlement agreement with us in early January 2019. In a separate litigation, we have been sued by the manufacturer of another approved generic version of Sensipar® who is contending that provisions of its own settlement agreement with Amgen have been triggered by the first manufacturer’s at-risk launch, giving this second manufacturer a right to market its own generic version under its settlement agreement. See Part IV—Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2019, we expect Sensipar® sales will be lower than 2018 due to the temporary generic market entry, continued adoption of Parsabiv® and higher purchases in 2018 due to the reimbursement change from Medicare Part D to Part B. Further, generic competitors may enter the market at risk at any time. EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016EPOGEN® — U.S.$1,010 (8)% $1,096 (15)% $1,282The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for 2018 was driven primarily by a decline in net selling price due to contractual terms negotiated with DaVita (see Part I, Item I. Business—Business Relationships). In 2019, we expect a more significant decline in net selling price. 48The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for 2017 was driven primarily by a decline in net selling price due to contractual terms negotiated with DaVita and, to a lesser extent, a shift in some U.S. dialysis centers to Aranesp®.Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN® expired in May 2015. We face competition in the United States, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of EPOGEN ®. Multiple companies are developing proposed biosimilar versions of EPOGEN ®. A biosimilar version of EPOGEN ® was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and launched in the fourth quarter of 2018. Other biosimilar versions of EPOGEN ® may also receive approval. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigation with one of these companies, see Part IV—Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016KYPROLIS® — U.S.$583 4 % $562 1 % $554KYPROLIS® — ROW385 41 % 273 98 % 138Nplate® — U.S.438 12 % 392 12 % 350Nplate® — ROW279 12 % 250 7 % 234Vectibix® — U.S.288 15 % 251 10 % 229Vectibix® — ROW403 3 % 391 2 % 382Repatha® — U.S.358 59 % 225 * 101Repatha® — ROW192 * 94 * 40NEUPOGEN® — U.S.223 (40)% 369 (31)% 534NEUPOGEN® — ROW142 (21)% 180 (22)% 231Parsabiv® — U.S.302 * — — % —Parsabiv® — ROW34 * 5 * —BLINCYTO® — U.S.134 18 % 114 34 % 85BLINCYTO® — ROW96 57 % 61 * 30Aimovig® — U.S.119 * — — % —Biosimilars — ROW55 * — — % —Other — U.S.85 25 % 68 13 % 60Other — ROW190 4 % 183 (4)% 190Total other product sales$4,306 26 % $3,418 8 % $3,158Total U.S. — other products$2,530 $1,981 $1,913Total ROW — other products1,776 1,437 1,245Total other product sales$4,306 $3,418 $3,158* Change in excess of 100%49Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017 Change Year ended December 31, 2016Operating expenses: Cost of sales$4,101 1 % $4,069 (2)% $4,162% of product sales18.2% 18.7% 19.0%% of total revenues17.3% 17.8% 18.1%Research and development$3,737 5 % $3,562 (7)% $3,840% of product sales16.6% 16.3% 17.5%% of total revenues15.7% 15.6% 16.7%Selling, general and administrative$5,332 9 % $4,870 (4)% $5,062% of product sales23.7% 22.3% 23.1%% of total revenues22.5% 21.3% 22.0%Other$314 (16)% $375 * $133* Change in excess of 100%Transformation and process improvementDuring 2014, we announced transformation and process improvement efforts that we continue to execute. As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders.The transformation included a restructuring plan, and the activities associated with the restructuring plan have been completed. As of December 31, 2018, restructuring costs incurred to date were $809 million. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred restructuring costs of $12 million, $88 million and $37 million, respectively. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.9 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings have not been significant as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Part IV—Note 2, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Cost of salesCost of sales decreased to 17.3% of total revenues for 2018, driven primarily by lower royalty costs, expenses related to Hurricane Maria in 2017 and lower acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by higher manufacturing costs. Cost of sales decreased to 17.8% of total revenues for 2017, driven primarily by lower acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets, lower royalty costs and favorable manufacturing costs, offset partially by expenses related to Hurricane Maria, unfavorable product mix and other inventory costs. 50Research and developmentThe Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Research and early pipeline (formerly Discovery Research and Translational Sciences), (2) later-stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories are described below:Category DescriptionResearch and early pipeline R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development.Later-stage clinical programs R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU.Marketed products R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained.R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Research and early pipeline$1,201 $972 $1,039Later-stage clinical programs1,034 879 1,054Marketed products1,502 1,711 1,747Total R&D expense$3,737 $3,562 $3,840The increase in R&D expense for 2018 was driven by higher spend on our early pipeline, later-stage clinical programs as well as external business development expense in research and early pipeline, offset partially by lower marketed product support.The decrease in R&D expense for 2017 was driven by decreased costs associated with later-stage clinical program support, lower external business development expense in research and early pipeline and lower marketed product support. Selling, general and administrativeThe increase in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense for 2018 was driven primarily by investments in product launches and marketed product support. The decrease in SG&A expense for 2017 was driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016, offset partially by investments in product launches and marketed product support. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired in October 2013, and we were required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of ENBREL net sales in the United States and Canada. Effective November 2016, there were no further residual royalty payments. The residual royalty percentage ranged from 10% to 11% in 2016.OtherOther operating expenses for 2018 included a $330 million impairment charge associated with an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and a $42 million favorable net change in the fair values of contingent consideration. See Part IV—Note 14, Goodwill and other intangible assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other operating expenses for 2017 included $284 million of impairment-related charges associated with an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and $83 million of certain net charges related to our restructuring plan. Other operating expenses for 2016 included $105 million of charges related to legal proceedings.51Nonoperating expenses/income and income taxesNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Interest expense, net$1,392 $1,304 $1,260Interest and other income, net$674 $928 $629Provision for income taxes$1,151 $7,618 $1,441Effective tax rate12.1% 79.4% 15.7%Interest expense, netThe increase in Interest expense, net, for 2018 was due primarily to the impact of rising interest rates on variable-rate debt. The increase in Interest expense, net, for 2017 was due primarily to a higher average amount of debt outstanding compared with the prior year.Interest and other income, netThe decrease in Interest and other income, net, for 2018 was due primarily to higher investment losses and lower interest income as a result of the liquidation of a portion of our portfolio, offset partially by gains on our equity investments and a net gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of K-A in the first quarter of 2018. See Part IV—Note 3, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The increase in Interest and other income, net, for 2017 was due primarily to higher interest income that resulted from higher average investment balances and higher gains on strategic investments.Income taxesThe decrease in our effective tax rate for 2018 compared with 2017 was due primarily to impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform.On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the 2017 Tax Act, which imposes a repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposes a current tax on certain foreign earnings and lowers the general corporate income tax rate to 21%. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, including the repatriation tax, the net deferred tax remeasurement and the impact on our unrealized tax benefits. None of the adjustments we made to our provisional amounts were material to our consolidated financial statements.As previously disclosed, we received a RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS’s calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued.See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies—Income taxes, and Part IV—Note 7, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.52Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2018 2017Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$29,304 $41,678Total assets$66,416 $79,954Current portion of long-term debt$4,419 $1,152Long-term debt$29,510 $34,190Stockholders’ equity$12,500 $25,241Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesWe have global access to our $29.3 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as we no longer reinvest the related undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely outside the United States. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we recorded a repatriation tax liability on undistributed earnings generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions estimated at $7.3 billion, which will be paid over eight years. The first annual payment was made in April 2018. See Contractual Obligations below. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Capital allocationConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner, and we consider several alternatives such as payment of dividends, stock repurchases, repayment of debt, and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest. We intend to continue to invest in our business and return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.00 per share of common stock paid in 2016, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.15 per share of common stock paid in 2017, and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.32 per share of common stock paid in 2018. In December 2018, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.45 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2019.We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2018, we repurchased $17.9 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $17.8 billion, which included 52.1 million shares of common stock repurchased through a $10.0 billion tender offer. In 2017 and 2016, we repurchased $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion of our common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, $5.1 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.As a result of stock repurchases, including our recent tender offer, and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our accumulated deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt 53markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Financing arrangementsThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2018, were $4.4 billion and $29.5 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2017, were $1.2 billion and $34.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch) assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings.During 2018, we did not issue any debt or debt securities. During 2017 and 2016, we issued debt with aggregate principal amounts of $4.5 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we repaid debt of $1.1 billion, $4.4 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $10.95 billion and $9.45 billion, respectively.To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion. As of December 31, 2018, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2017, we issued and repaid an aggregate of $12.3 billion commercial paper and had a maximum outstanding balance of $1.5 billion under our commercial paper program. During 2018 and 2016, we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2018 or 2017.In 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. We extended this term by one year during 2016 and may extend the term for an additional year with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 1% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.In 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2020.Certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant, which was modified during 2018. The modified covenant requires that we maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest expense, each as defined and described in the amended credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2018. See Part IV—Note 16, Financing arrangements, and Note 19, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.54Cash flowsOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Net cash provided by operating activities$11,296 $11,177 $10,354Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$14,339 $(4,024) $(8,658)Net cash used in financing activities$(22,490) $(6,594) $(2,599)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2018 due primarily to improvements in working capital, offset partially by higher payments to taxing authorities. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2017 due primarily to higher operating margin and the timing of payments to vendors and receipts from customers, offset partially by higher payments to taxing authorities. InvestingCash provided by investing activities during 2018 was due primarily to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $15.0 billion and cash used in investing activities during 2017 and 2016 was due primarily to net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $3.2 billion, and $7.7 billion, respectively. Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with site development costs, including our Thousand Oaks campus, as well as the new next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Rhode Island and life-cycle investments across the manufacturing network, were $738 million, $664 million and $738 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We currently estimate 2019 spending on capital projects to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during 2018 was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $17.8 billion, the payment of dividends of $3.5 billion, repayment of debt of $1.1 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $126 million. Cash used in financing activities during 2017 was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $3.4 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $3.2 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $191 million, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayment, of $71 million. Cash used in financing activities during 2016 was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $3.0 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $3.0 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $260 million, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayment, of $3.6 billion.See Part IV—Note 16, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.55The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period as of December 31, 2018Contractual obligations Total Year 1 Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 Years 6 and beyondLong-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) $54,276 $5,856 $8,777 $7,444 $32,199Operating lease obligations (4) 569 164 239 120 46Purchase obligations (5) 1,153 609 305 124 115U.S. repatriation tax (6) 6,739 586 1,172 1,685 3,296Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (7) — — — — —Total contractual obligations $62,737 $7,215 $10,493 $9,373 $35,656(1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our fixed-rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the terms of the related hedge contracts. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2018, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts, which resulted in an aggregate net increase in future interest payments of $77 million. See Part IV—Note 16, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our LIBOR-based variable-rate obligations. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2018, in computing the LIBOR-based portion of interest payments on these debt obligations. See Part IV—Note 16, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(3) Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated long-term debt, we enter into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IV—Note 19, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(4) Operating lease obligations exclude $203 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities.(5) Purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.(6) Under the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay the repatriation tax related primarily to our prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations in eight annual installments. See Part IV—Note 7, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(7) Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties of $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2018, are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities.In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisition of K-A and BioVex Group Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $7.5 billion, including $325 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. Contingent consideration with respect to the acquisition of Dezima Pharma B.V. was excluded due to the discontinuation of the development of AMG 899, upon which payments are based. See Part IV—Note 18, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.56Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.Product sales and sales deductionsRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions TotalBalance as of December 31, 2015$1,119 $273 $94 $1,486Amounts charged against product sales3,479 5,270 905 9,654Payments(3,181) (5,201) (884) (9,266)Balance as of December 31, 20161,417 342 115 1,874Amounts charged against product sales4,909 6,098 992 11,999Payments(4,459) (6,168) (999) (11,626)Balance as of December 31, 20171,867 272 108 2,247Amounts charged against product sales6,180 6,926 1,180 14,286Payments(5,458) (6,744) (1,161) (13,363)Balance as of December 31, 2018$2,589 $454 $127 $3,170For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, total sales deductions were 39%, 35% and 31% of gross product sales, respectively. The increase in the total sales deductions balance as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, was driven primarily by the impact of higher sales, increases in U.S. rebates and chargebacks, as well as timing of payments. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold.Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements, which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels, and we accrue these rebates in the period the related sales are recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. 57Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.Product returnsReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.Income taxesWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.Certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return, but have not yet recognized the expense in the consolidated financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.We are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035.On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the 2017 Tax Act, which imposes a repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposes a current tax on certain foreign earnings and lowers the general corporate income tax rate to 21%. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118, which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, including the repatriation tax, the net deferred tax remeasurement and the impact on our unrealized tax benefits. None of the adjustments we made to our provisional amounts were material to our consolidated financial statements.As previously disclosed, we received a RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS’s calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the 58complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. See Part IV—Note 7, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries, including the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in Part IV—Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinationsWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. See Part IV—Note 3, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:•determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;•projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;•estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and•developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.Impairment of long-lived assetsWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the 59carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value.Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination that have not reached technological feasibility or that lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Part IV—Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2018.Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.Interest-rate-sensitive financial instrumentsOur portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, was composed of U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities, corporate debt securities, residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market mutual funds and other short-term interest-bearing securities composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $28.7 billion and $41.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these securities of $360 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year.As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.9 billion and a fair value of $35.0 billion. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $35.3 billion and a fair value of $38.6 billion. Our outstanding debt was composed primarily of debt with fixed interest rates, with variable-rate debt having carrying values of $850 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, would have resulted in increases of $2.6 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. Analysis of the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below.60To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $10.95 billion and $9.45 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of $460 million and $420 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income in the respective ensuing years. Analysis of the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest-rate-sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion that hedge certain of our foreign-currency-denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of $320 million and $390 million, respectively.Foreign-currency-sensitive financial instrumentsOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and fair value of $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and fair value of $6.2 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.1 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.1 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2017, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.3 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.2 billion. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the related foreign-currency-denominated debt.We have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs with an aggregate notional amount of $5.6 billion, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these contracts of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion on these dates, respectively. The impact of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates on ensuing years’ income from these contracts would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2018, we had open foreign currency forward and option contracts, primarily euro based with notional amounts of $4.5 billion and $21 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had open foreign currency forward and option contracts, primarily euro based with notional amounts of $4.6 billion and $74 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 the fair values of these contracts were a $181 million asset and a $26 million liability. As of December 31, 2017 the fair values of these contracts were a $6 million asset and a $204 million liability. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open as of December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $810 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $380 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2017, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2017, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $930 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $360 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.61As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $737 million and $757 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Market-price-sensitive financial instrumentsAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small-capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, was not material.Counterparty credit risksOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk, which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A– or equivalent by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.",2023-12-30 18:05:17.577275

A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world’s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. In 2020, we celebrate our 40th anniversary, continuing our history of focusing on innovative medicines that have the potential to be first-in-class molecules and that have a large-effect size on serious diseases.Our principal products—those with the most significant annual commercial sales—are ENBREL, Neulasta®, Prolia®, XGEVA®, Aranesp®, KYPROLIS®, EPOGEN® and our recently acquired product Otezla®. We also market a number of other products, including Nplate®, Vectibix®, Repatha®, Parsabiv®, Sensipar®/Mimpara®, BLINCYTO®, Aimovig®, NEUPOGEN®, KANJINTITM, AMGEVITATM, EVENITY®, MVASITM, IMLYGIC® and Corlanor®. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.Our strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry. We focus on six commercial areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology, bone health, cardiovascular disease, nephrology and neuroscience and conduct discovery research primarily in three therapeutic areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology and cardiovascular/metabolic diseases. In 2019, we advanced our innovative pipeline, launched branded biosimilar programs, built our global geographic reach and expanded our next generation manufacturing capabilities, while returning capital to shareholders. During the year we delivered strong financial results while facing competition from biosimilars and generics. Total product sales decreased 1% as lower net selling prices were offset partially by volume growth. Product sales decreased 5% in the United States and grew 11% in the rest of the world. Total operating expenses increased 2% as we invested in our innovative R&D pipeline, including our early oncology assets.We continued to advance our pipeline, including AMG 510, which was granted fast track designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with previously treated metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation. We launched EVENITY® in the United States and Japan, and it was granted marketing authorization in Europe; and the United States label for KYPROLIS® was expanded. We also continued to advance our biosimilar program with the launches of KANJINTITM and MVASITM in the United States and the approval of AVSOLATM for all approved indications of the reference product REMICADE® (infliximab) in the United States. Lastly, we made a regulatory submission for ABP 798 in the United States.We have also continued to invest in external opportunities to augment our internal programs and products. We completed our acquisition of worldwide rights to Otezla®, the only oral, non-biologic treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We strengthened our international footprint with the announcement of a strategic collaboration with BeiGene to expand our oncology presence in China. In addition, we expanded our human genetics capabilities, by entering into a collaboration with a regional healthcare system in the United States and joining a consortium to perform whole genome sequencing of approximately 500,000 participants from the United Kingdom. Our human genetics capabilities allow us to identify new development targets in our chosen areas of therapeutic focus. Cash flows from operating activities were $9.2 billion, enabling us to invest in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. For 2019, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.45 per share of common stock. In December 2019, we declared a cash dividend of $1.60 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2020. We also repurchased 40.2 million shares of our common stock throughout 2019 at an aggregate cost of $7.6 billion.Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. Certain of our products face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents, and Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities, but successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain and we also are facing increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.Rising healthcare costs and economic conditions also continue to pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public and private healthcare-provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. 46See Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales.Selected Financial InformationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data): Year ended December 31, 2019 Change Year ended December 31, 2018Product sales: U.S.$16,531 (5)% $17,429Rest of world (ROW)5,673 11 % 5,104Total product sales22,204 (1)% 22,533Other revenues1,158 (5)% 1,214Total revenues$23,362 (2)% $23,747Operating expenses$13,688 2 % $13,484Operating income$9,674 (6)% $10,263Net income$7,842 (7)% $8,394Diluted EPS$12.88 2 % $12.62Diluted shares609 (8)% 665In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held at wholesaler customers and end users such as pharmacies.Total product sales decreased for 2019, driven primarily by a decline in net selling price, offset partially by higher unit demand. For 2020, we expect net selling price to continue to decline.Other revenues decreased for 2019, driven primarily by lower milestone payments, offset partially by higher royalties.Operating expenses increased for 2019, driven primarily by higher spending in research and early pipeline in support of our oncology programs, offset partially by an impairment charge associated with an IPR&D asset in 2018.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2019, 2018 or 2017.47Results of OperationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2019 Change Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017ENBREL$5,226 4 % $5,014 (8)% $5,433Neulasta®3,221 (28)% 4,475 (1)% 4,534Prolia®2,672 17 % 2,291 16 % 1,968XGEVA®1,935 8 % 1,786 13 % 1,575Aranesp®1,729 (8)% 1,877 (9)% 2,053KYPROLIS®1,044 8 % 968 16 % 835EPOGEN®867 (14)% 1,010 (8)% 1,096Sensipar®/Mimpara®551 (69)% 1,774 3 % 1,718Other products4,959 49 % 3,338 29 % 2,583Total product sales$22,204 (1)% $22,533 3 % $21,795Total U.S.$16,531 (5)% $17,429 2 % $17,131Total ROW5,673 11 % 5,104 9 % 4,664Total product sales$22,204 (1)% $22,533 3 % $21,795Future sales of our products will depend in part on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1.

In addition, for a list of our products’ significant competitors, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2019 Change Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017ENBREL — U.S.$5,050 5 % $4,807 (8)% $5,206ENBREL — Canada176 (15)% 207 (9)% 227Total ENBREL$5,226 4 %$5,014 (8)% $5,433The increase in ENBREL sales for 2019 was driven primarily by favorable impacts from changes in accounting estimates of sales deductions and an increase in net selling price, offset partially by lower unit demand. For 2020, we expect the trend of lower unit demand to continue.The decrease in ENBREL sales for 2018 was driven primarily by lower unit demand and net selling price.In April 2019, the FDA approved a second biosimilar version of ENBREL, and we are involved in patent litigations with the two companies seeking to market their FDA-approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other companies are also developing proposed biosimilar versions of ENBREL. Companies with approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL may seek to enter the U.S. market if we are not successful in our litigations, or even earlier. 48Neulasta® Total Neulasta® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2019 Change Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017Neulasta® — U.S.$2,814 (27)% $3,866 (2)% $3,931Neulasta® — ROW407 (33)% 609 1 % 603Total Neulasta®$3,221 (28)%$4,475 (1)% $4,534The decrease in global Neulasta® sales for 2019 was driven by the impact of biosimilar competition on net selling price and unit demand. Neulasta® sales for 2019 included a $98 million order in the first quarter from the U.S. government. The decrease in global Neulasta® sales for 2018 was driven primarily by favorable changes in accounting estimates of product returns in 2017, offset partially by favorable changes in inventory. Neulasta® sales for 2018 included a $55 million order in the fourth quarter from the U.S. government. Biosimilar versions of Neulasta® have been approved and launched, and other biosimilar versions may also receive approval in the near future. Therefore, we face increased competition in the United States and Europe, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of Neulasta®. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigations related to these and other biosimilars, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2019 Change Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017Prolia® — U.S.$1,772 18% $1,500 18% $1,272Prolia® — ROW900 14% 791 14% 696Total Prolia®$2,672 17% $2,291 16% $1,968The increases in global Prolia® sales for 2019 and 2018 were driven by higher unit demand. Prolia®, which has a six-month dosing interval, has exhibited a historical sales pattern, with the first and third quarters of a year representing lower sales than the second and fourth quarters of a year.XGEVA® Total XGEVA® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2019 Change Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017XGEVA® — U.S.$1,457 9% $1,338 16% $1,157XGEVA® — ROW478 7% 448 7% 418Total XGEVA®$1,935 8% $1,786 13% $1,575The increases in global XGEVA® sales for 2019 and 2018 were driven primarily by higher unit demand.49Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2019 Change Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017Aranesp® — U.S.$758 (20)% $942 (15)% $1,114Aranesp® — ROW971 4 % 935 — % 939Total Aranesp®$1,729 (8)%$1,877 (9)% $2,053The decreases in global Aranesp® sales for 2019 and 2018 were driven primarily by the impact of competition on unit demand in the United States.Aranesp® faces competition from a long-acting ESA. Aranesp® also faces competition from a biosimilar version of EPOGEN®. Other biosimilar versions of EPOGEN® may also receive approval in the future. In 2019, sales in the United States declined, and we expect them to continue to decline at a faster rate in 2020 due to short- and long-acting competition. KYPROLIS® Total KYPROLIS® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2019 Change Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017KYPROLIS® — U.S.$654 12% $583 4% $562KYPROLIS® — ROW390 1% 385 41% 273Total KYPROLIS®$1,044 8% $968 16% $835The increase in global KYPROLIS® sales for 2019 was driven primarily by higher unit demand. The increase in global KYPROLIS® sales for 2018 was driven primarily by higher unit demand, offset partially by lower net selling price. We are engaged in litigation with two related companies that are challenging our material patents related to KYPROLIS® and that are seeking to market generic carfilzomib products. Separately, we have entered into confidential settlement agreements with other companies developing generic carfilzomib products, and the court has entered consent judgments enjoining those companies from infringing certain of our patents, subject to terms of the confidential settlement agreements. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The FDA has reported that it has tentatively approved Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) filed by two companies for generic carfilzomib products. The date of final approval of those ANDAs is governed by the Hatch-Waxman Act and any applicable settlement agreements between the parties.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2019 Change Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017EPOGEN® — U.S.$867 (14)% $1,010 (8)% $1,096The decreases in EPOGEN® sales for 2019 and 2018 were driven primarily by a decline in net selling price due to our contract with DaVita. See Part I, Item I. Business—Business Relationships. In 2020, we expect a lower net selling price compared with 2019 due to our contract with DaVita. 50A biosimilar version of EPOGEN® has been approved and launched, and other biosimilar versions may also receive approval in the future. Therefore, we face increased competition in the United States, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of EPOGEN®. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigation related to one of these biosimilars, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Sensipar®/Mimpara® Total Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2019 Change Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017Sensipar® — U.S.$252 (82)% $1,436 5 % $1,374Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW299 (12)% 338 (2)% 344Total Sensipar®/Mimpara®$551 (69)%$1,774 3 % $1,718The decrease in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for 2019 was driven by the impact of generic competitors on unit demand. The increase in global Sensipar®/Mimpara® sales for 2018 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States, offset partially by lower unit demand. Our U.S. composition-of-matter patent related to Sensipar®, a small molecule, expired in March 2018. We are involved in litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic cinacalcet products surrounding our U.S. formulation patent, which expires in September 2026. During the course of the patent litigation, we have entered into confidential settlement agreements with several of these companies. The court has entered consent judgments enjoining certain of those companies from infringing certain of our patents, subject to terms of the confidential settlement agreements. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Companies manufacturing generics began selling their generic cinacalcet products in the United States in late 2018 and 2019. Sensipar® sales have been and, we believe, may continue to be adversely impacted as a result of generic-product sales in the U.S. market. 51Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2019 Change Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017Nplate® — U.S.$480 10 % $438 12 % $392Nplate® — ROW315 13 % 279 12 % 250Vectibix® — U.S.316 10 % 288 15 % 251Vectibix® — ROW428 6 % 403 3 % 391Repatha® — U.S.376 5 % 358 59 % 225Repatha® — ROW285 48 % 192 * 94Parsabiv® — U.S.550 82 % 302 * —Parsabiv® — ROW80 * 34 * 5BLINCYTO® — U.S.176 31 % 134 18 % 114BLINCYTO® — ROW136 42 % 96 57 % 61Aimovig® — U.S.306 * 119 * —NEUPOGEN® — U.S.178 (20)% 223 (40)% 369NEUPOGEN® — ROW86 (39)% 142 (21)% 180KANJINTITM — U.S.118 * — — % —KANJINTITM — ROW108 * 44 * —AMGEVITATM — ROW215 * 11 * —EVENITY® — U.S.42 * — — % —EVENITY® — ROW147 * — — % —Otezla® — U.S.139 * — — % —Otezla® — ROW39 * — — % —MVASITM — U.S.121 * — — % —MVASITM — ROW6 * — — % —Other — U.S.105 24 % 85 25 % 68Other — ROW207 9 % 190 4 % 183Total other product sales$4,959 49 % $3,338 29 % $2,583Total U.S. — other products$2,907 49 % $1,947 37 % $1,419Total ROW — other products2,052 48 % 1,391 20 % 1,164Total other product sales$4,959 49 % $3,338 29 % $2,583* Change in excess of 100%.52Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2019 Change Year ended December 31, 2018 Change Year ended December 31, 2017Operating expenses: Cost of sales$4,356 6 % $4,101 1 % $4,069% of product sales19.6% 18.2% 18.7%% of total revenues18.6% 17.3% 17.8%Research and development$4,116 10 % $3,737 5 % $3,562% of product sales18.5% 16.6% 16.3%% of total revenues17.6% 15.7% 15.6%Selling, general and administrative$5,150 (3)% $5,332 9 % $4,870% of product sales23.2% 23.7% 22.3%% of total revenues22.0% 22.5% 21.3%Other$66 (79)% $314 (16)% $375Cost of salesCost of sales increased to 18.6% of total revenues for 2019, driven primarily by unfavorable product mix and amortization of intangible assets as a result of our acquisition of Otezla®, offset partially by lower royalties and lower manufacturing costs. Cost of sales decreased to 17.3% of total revenues for 2018, driven primarily by lower royalty costs, expenses related to Hurricane Maria in 2017 and lower acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by higher manufacturing costs. Research and developmentThe Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (i) research and early pipeline, (ii) later-stage clinical programs and (iii) marketed products. These categories are described below:Category DescriptionResearch and early pipeline R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process developmentLater-stage clinical programs R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product primarily in the United States or the EUMarketed products R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold primarily in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtainedR&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017Research and early pipeline$1,649 $1,201 $972Later-stage clinical programs1,062 1,034 879Marketed products1,405 1,502 1,711Total R&D expense$4,116 $3,737 $3,56253The increase in R&D expense for 2019 was driven primarily by higher spend in research and early pipeline in support of our oncology programs, offset partially by lower marketed-product support.The increase in R&D expense for 2018 was driven by higher spend on our early pipeline and later-stage clinical programs as well as external business development expense in research and early pipeline, offset partially by lower marketed-product support.Selling, general and administrativeThe decrease in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for 2019 was driven primarily by lower general and administrative expenses, the end of certain amortization charges in 2018 and lower spend for launched and marketed products, offset partially by spending for Otezla® commercial-related expenses. The increase in SG&A expense for 2018 was driven primarily by investments in product launches and marketed-product support. OtherOther operating expenses for 2019 included $47 million in restructuring costs.Other operating expenses for 2018 included a $330 million impairment charge associated with an IPR&D asset and a $42 million favorable net change in the fair values of contingent consideration liabilities. See Part IV—Note 17, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other operating expenses for 2017 included $284 million of impairment-related charges associated with an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and $83 million of certain net charges related to a restructuring plan. Nonoperating expenses/income and income taxesNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017Interest expense, net$1,289 $1,392 $1,304Interest and other income, net$753 $674 $928Provision for income taxes$1,296 $1,151 $7,618Effective tax rate14.2% 12.1% 79.4%Interest expense, netThe decrease in Interest expense, net, for 2019 was due primarily to a reduction in outstanding long-term debt as a result of maturities in the current year.The increase in Interest expense, net, for 2018 was due primarily to the impact of rising interest rates on variable-rate debt. Interest and other income, netThe increase in Interest and other income, net, for 2019 was due primarily to net gains on sales of investments in interest-bearing securities liquidated to fund our acquisition of Otezla® and our investment in BeiGene compared with losses in the prior year, offset partially by reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash balances and a gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (K-A), in the first quarter of 2018. See Part IV—Note 2, Acquisitions, and Note 21, Subsequent events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The decrease in Interest and other income, net, for 2018 was due primarily to higher investment losses and lower interest income as a result of the liquidation of a portion of our portfolio, offset partially by gains on our equity investments and a net gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of K-A. Income taxesThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2019 compared with 2018 was due primarily to a prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reform.The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2018 compared with 2017 was due primarily to impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform.54As previously disclosed, we received an RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS’s calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater or less than amounts accrued. See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies—Income taxes, and Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2019 2018Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$8,911 $29,304Total assets$59,707 $66,416Current portion of long-term debt$2,953 $4,419Long-term debt$26,950 $29,510Stockholders’ equity$9,673 $12,500Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesWe have global access to our $8.9 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Capital allocationConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner, and we consider several alternatives such as payment of dividends, stock repurchases, repayment of debt and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest. We intend to continue to invest in our business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases, thereby reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company’s agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.15 per share of common stock paid in 2017, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.32 per share of common stock paid in 2018 and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.45 per share of common stock paid in 2019. In December 2019, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.60 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2020.We also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2019, we repurchased $7.6 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $7.7 billion. In 2018, we repurchased $17.9 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $17.8 billion, which included 52.1 million shares of common stock repurchased through a $10.0 billion tender offer. In 2017, we repurchased $3.1 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $3.2 billion. In May 2019 and December 2019, 55our Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, $6.5 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.As a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our accumulated deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Financing arrangementsThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2019, were $3.0 billion and $27.0 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2018, were $4.4 billion and $29.5 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s), and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch), assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A- with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB+ with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings.During 2019 and 2018, we did not issue any debt or debt securities. During 2017, we issued debt with an aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we repaid debt of $4.5 billion, $1.1 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $9.6 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively.To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2017, we issued and repaid an aggregate of $12.3 billion of commercial paper and had a maximum outstanding balance of $1.5 billion under our commercial paper program. During 2019 and 2018, we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2019 or 2018.In 2019, we amended and restated our $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement, which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $750 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest for any amounts borrowed under this facility, based on our current credit rating, at (i) LIBOR plus 1% or (ii) the highest of (A) the syndication agent bank base commercial lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1%. The agreement contains provisions relating to the determination of successor rates to address the possible phase-out or unavailability of designated reference rates. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.It is anticipated that LIBOR will be phased out and replaced by 2022. While various replacement reference rates have been discussed, an alternative reference rate to LIBOR has not yet been widely adopted. Therefore, the mechanics to modify existing contracts that reference LIBOR have not been finalized. However, we do not expect that a change in the reference rate of our contracts will be material. See Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.56In February 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2023.Certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant, which requires that we maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2019. See Part IV—Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash flowsOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities$9,150 $11,296 $11,177Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$5,709 $14,339 $(4,024)Net cash used in financing activities$(15,767) $(22,490) $(6,594)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2019 due primarily to changes in working capital, an increase in payments to the IRS related to an advance deposit and lower Net income. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2018 due primarily to improvements in working capital, offset partially by higher payments to tax authorities. InvestingCash provided by investing activities during 2019 and 2018 was due primarily to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $20.0 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively. The liquidation of portions of our marketable securities portfolio in 2019 was due primarily to fund the acquisition of Otezla® and our investment in BeiGene and, in 2018, to fund the tender offer to repurchase our common stock. Cash used in investing activities during 2017 was due primarily to net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $3.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $618 million, $738 million and $664 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We currently estimate 2020 spending on capital projects to be approximately $700 million.FinancingCash used in financing activities during 2019 was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $7.7 billion, repayments of debt of $4.5 billion and payments of dividends of $3.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2018 was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $17.8 billion, payments of dividends of $3.5 billion and repayments of debt of $1.1 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2017 was due primarily to payments of dividends of $3.4 billion and repurchases of common stock of $3.2 billion, offset partially by proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, of $71 million. See Part IV—Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 16, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.57Contractual ObligationsContractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period as of December 31, 2019Contractual obligations Total Year 1 Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 Years 6 and beyondLong-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) $48,080 $4,086 $9,612 $4,467 $29,915Operating lease obligations (4) 910 159 266 157 328Purchase obligations (5) 1,938 1,512 255 100 71U.S. repatriation tax (6) 6,162 587 1,174 2,567 1,834Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (7) — — — — —Total contractual obligations $57,090 $6,344 $11,307 $7,291 $32,148(1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our fixed-rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the terms of the related hedge contracts. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2019, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts, which resulted in an aggregate net decrease in future interest payments of $309 million. See Part IV—Note 15, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our LIBOR-based variable-rate obligations. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2019, in computing the LIBOR-based portion of interest payments on these debt obligations. See Part IV—Note 15, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(3) Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayments of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively converted interest payments and principal repayments on this debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IV—Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(4) Operating lease obligations includes payments for leases that have not yet commenced, net of lease incentives, and excludes $141 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities.(5) Purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.(6) Under the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay in eight annual installments the repatriation tax related primarily to our prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments—Commitments – U.S. repatriation tax, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(7) Liabilities for UTBs are not included in the table above because due to their nature there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. See Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of K-A and BioVex Group Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2019, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $7.3 billion, including $325 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. Contingent 58consideration with respect to the acquisition of Dezima Pharma B.V. was excluded due to the discontinuation of the development of AMG 899, upon which payments are based. See Part IV—Note 17, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.Product sales and sales deductionsRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions TotalBalance as of December 31, 2016$1,417 $342 $115 $1,874Amounts charged against product sales4,909 6,098 992 11,999Payments(4,459) (6,168) (999) (11,626)Balance as of December 31, 20171,867 272 108 2,247Amounts charged against product sales6,180 6,926 1,180 14,286Payments(5,458) (6,744) (1,161) (13,363)Balance as of December 31, 20182,589 454 127 3,170Amounts charged against product sales6,825 7,090 1,292 15,207Payments(6,249) (6,985) (1,263) (14,497)Balance as of December 31, 2019$3,165 $559 $156 $3,880For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, total sales deductions were 41%, 39% and 35% of gross product sales, respectively. The increase in the total sales deductions balance as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, was driven primarily by the impact of increases in U.S. rebates and to a lesser extent, higher chargebacks. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold.Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements, which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels; and we accrue these rebates in the period the related sales are recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual 59settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.Product returnsReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.Income taxesWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.Certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.We are a vertically-integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct operations based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035.As previously disclosed, we received an RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS’s calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater or less than amounts accrued. See Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.60Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries, including the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitionsWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in an acquisition. See Part IV—Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to:•determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;•projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;•estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and•developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the business combination date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included but were not limited to the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations and assets acquisitions are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.61Impairment of long-lived assetsWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value.Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination that have not reached technological feasibility or that lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference, and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Part IV—Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2019.Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Except as noted below, we have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.Interest-rate-sensitive financial instrumentsOur portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, was composed of U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt securities, residential-mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market mutual funds and other short-term interest-bearing securities composed principally of commercial paper, and with respect to investments as of December 31, 2018, other government-related securities. The fair values of our available-for-sale investments were $8.2 billion and $28.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2019, would not have resulted in a material reduction in the fair value of these securities, and with respect to available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2018, would have resulted in a reduction of approximately $360 million in fair value. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year.As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $29.9 billion and a fair value of $33.7 billion. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.9 billion and a fair value of $35.0 billion. Our outstanding debt was composed primarily of debt with fixed interest rates, with variable-rate debt having carrying values of $300 million and $850 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis 62point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, would have resulted in increases of $3.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. Analysis of the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below.To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $9.6 billion and $11.0 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $380 million and $460 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income in the respective ensuing years. Analysis of the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest-rate-sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, that hedge our foreign-currency-denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $280 million and $320 million, respectively.Foreign-currency-sensitive financial instrumentsOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $4.5 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2019, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.0 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $0.9 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.1 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.1 billion. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the related foreign-currency-denominated debt.We have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these contracts of $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion on these dates, respectively. The impact of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates on ensuing years’ income from these contracts would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2019, we had primarily euro based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.0 billion. As of December 31, 2018, we had primarily euro based open foreign currency forward and option contracts with notional amounts of $4.5 billion and $21 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the fair values of these contracts were a $223 million asset and a $31 million liability. As of December 31, 2018, the fair values of these contracts were a $181 million asset and a $26 million liability. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open as of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2019, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $930 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $400 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign 63currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $810 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $380 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had open short-duration foreign currency forward contracts that mature in less than one month with notional amounts of $1.2 billion and $737 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, a hypothetical 5% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Market-price-sensitive financial instrumentsAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we were exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small-capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, was not material.Counterparty credit risksOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk, which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring that transactions be made only with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A– or equivalent by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch; and it requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.",2023-12-30 18:05:13.662301
318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview, Selected Financial Information and Results of Operations. For a discussion of the risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic to our results, see Risk Factors in Item 1A. Also see the remainder of Item 1. Business for discussion of pandemic-related impacts to our overall business.Products/Pipeline Oncology/HematologyKYPROLIS® (carfilzomib)•In August 2020, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved the expansion of the KYPROLIS® U.S. prescribing information to include its use in combination with DARZALEX® (daratumumab) plus dexamethasone in two dosing regimens—once weekly and twice weekly—for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three previous lines of therapy. Sotorasib (formerly AMG 510)•In September 2020, we announced updated phase 1 data evaluating sotorasib in 129 patients across multiple advanced solid tumors with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) G12C mutation, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Data from 59 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were also featured in an oral presentation at a September 2020 medical conference. In the patients with advanced NSCLC who were treated with the 960 mg daily dose, the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 35.3%. Across all dose levels, the confirmed ORR was 32.2%, with median duration of response of 10.9 months and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.3 months; 10 of 19 responders were still in response as of the data cutoff.•In October 2020, we announced top-line phase 2 results in 126 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced NSCLC. Sotorasib demonstrated an ORR (primary endpoint) consistent with previously reported phase 1 data in patients taking the 960 mg daily dose. Other measures of efficacy, including duration of response, were promising, and more than half of the responders were still on treatment and continuing to respond as of the data cutoff date. The results of this phase 2 study are potentially registrational, and a phase 3 confirmatory study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel is currently recruiting patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced NSCLC.1•In December 2020, we announced that the FDA had granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for our investigational KRASG12C inhibitor, sotorasib, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, as determined by an FDA-approved test, following at least one prior systemic therapy. Following this announcement, we submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA. The sotorasib NDA is being reviewed by the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, which aims to explore a more efficient review process that ensures safe and effective treatments are made available to patients as early as possible. Later in December, we also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).•In January 2021, we announced results from the phase 2 cohort of the clinical study evaluating sotorasib in 126 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced NSCLC. Sotorasib demonstrated a confirmed ORR and disease control rate of 37.1% and 80.6%, respectively, a median duration of response of 10 months and median progression-free survival of 6.8 months. In addition, sotorasib was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the National Medical Products Administration in China. RIABNITM (rituximab-arrx) (formerly ABP 798)•In December 2020, we announced that the FDA had approved RIABNITM, a biosimilar to Rituxan® (rituximab), for the treatment of adult patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis. RIABNITM launched in the United States in January 2021.InflammationOtezla® (apremilast)•In May 2020, we announced positive top-line results from a phase 3 study to assess the efficacy of Otezla® in adults with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis. The study showed that oral Otezla® 30 mg twice daily achieved a statistically significant improvement, compared with placebo, in the primary endpoint of the static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) response (defined as an sPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline) at week 16.Enbrel® (etanercept)•In July 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment by the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey upholding the validity of the two patents that describe and claim ENBREL and methods for making it. See Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Tezepelumab•In November 2020, we and AstraZeneca plc (AstraZeneca) announced positive top-line results from the registrational phase 3 NAVIGATOR trial in adults and adolescents with severe uncontrolled asthma. The trial met the primary endpoint with tezepelumab added to standard of care (SoC), demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction compared with placebo plus SoC in the annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks in the overall patient population. SoC consisted of medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus at least one additional controller medication with or without oral corticosteroids (OCS). We expect to submit results of this study to regulators in 2021.•In December 2020, we and AstraZeneca announced that the SOURCE trial had not met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in the daily OCS dose, without loss of asthma control, with tezepelumab compared to placebo. The results of this trial have no impact on our submission plans.CardiovascularOmecamtiv mecarbil•In November 2020, based on results of the omecamtiv mecarbil phase 3 trial, we provided notice to Cytokinetics, Incorporated (Cytokinetics) of termination of our collaboration and our intention to transition to them the development and commercialization rights for omecamtiv mecarbil and AMG 594.2Establishment of wholly owned affiliate in Japan •In April 2020, we completed our purchase from Astellas of the remaining shares of Amgen Astellas BioPharma K.K. (AABP), a joint venture between Amgen and Astellas established in 2013. AABP, now a wholly owned Amgen affiliate in Japan and renamed Amgen K.K., has enabled us to build a strong presence in Japan as we continue to advance treatments for serious illnesses. The purchase did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsThe largest concentration of our sales and marketing forces is based in the United States and Europe. In addition, we continue to expand the commercialization and marketing of our products into other geographic territories, including parts of Asia, the Middle East, Canada and Latin America. This expansion is occurring by establishing our own affiliates, by acquiring existing third-party businesses or product rights or by collaborating with third parties. See Business Relationships for our significant alliances. Whether we use our own sales and marketing forces or a third party’s varies across these markets. Such use typically depends on several factors, including the nature of entry into the new market, the size of an opportunity and operational capabilities. Together with our collaborators, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.In the United States, substantially all of our sales are to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, which are the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. We also market certain products through direct-to-consumer channels, including print, television and online media. For further discussion, see Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. Outside the United States, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country.Our product sales to three large wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., each individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years 2020, 2019 and 2018. On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for 83%, 81% and 84% of worldwide gross revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, in certain circumstances, by requiring letters of credit or obtaining credit insurance.3Our products are marketed around the world, with the United States being our largest market. The following chart shows our product sales by principal product, and the table below (dollar amounts in millions) shows product sales by geography for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018.202020192018Product Sales by Geography:U.S.$17,985 74 %$16,531 74 %$17,429 77 %Ex-U.S. 6,255 26 %5,673 26 %5,104 23 %Total$24,240 100 %$22,204 100 %$22,533 100 %4ENBRELWe market ENBREL, a tumor necrosis factor blocker, primarily in the United States. ENBREL was launched in 1998 and is used primarily in indications for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and patients with active psoriatic arthritis.Prolia® (denosumab)We market Prolia® primarily in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Prolia® contains the same active ingredient as XGEVA® (denosumab) but is approved for different indications, patient populations, doses and frequencies of administration. Prolia® was launched in the United States and Europe in 2010. In the United States, it is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or in patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In Europe, Prolia® is used primarily for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture.Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim)We market Neulasta®, a pegylated protein based on the filgrastim molecule, primarily in the United States and Europe. Neulasta® was launched in 2002 and is used primarily in the indication to help reduce the chance of infection due to a low white blood cell count in patients with certain types of cancer (nonmyeloid) who receive anticancer medicines (chemotherapy) that can cause fever and a low blood cell count. In 2015, the Neulasta® Onpro® kit became available in the United States. The Neulasta® Onpro® kit provides physicians the opportunity to initiate the administration of Neulasta® on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery of the recommended dose of Neulasta® at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving patients a trip back to the doctor.Otezla®We market Otezla®, a small molecule that inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), primarily in the United States and Europe. Otezla® was acquired from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) in November 2019, post their acquisition of Celgene Corporation (Celgene). Otezla® is an oral therapy approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis for whom phototherapy or systemic therapy is appropriate, patients with active psoriatic arthritis and patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet’s disease. In Europe, Otezla® is approved for second-line use in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.XGEVA®We market XGEVA® primarily in the United States and Europe. XGEVA® was launched in 2010 and is used primarily in the indication for prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or surgery to bone) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors and multiple myeloma.Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa)We market Aranesp® primarily in the United States and Europe. It was launched in 2001 and is indicated to treat a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells (anemia) caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD) in both patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. Aranesp® is also indicated for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy in certain patients with nonmyeloid malignancies and when chemotherapy will be used for at least two months after starting Aranesp®.KYPROLIS®We market KYPROLIS® primarily in the United States and Europe. KYPROLIS® was launched in 2012 and is indicated in combination with dexamethasone or with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. It is also approved as a single agent for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more previous therapies. In September 2019, the CANDOR phase 3 study of KYPROLIS® in combination with dexamethasone and DARZALEX® (daratumumab) met its primary endpoint of PFS in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In August 2020, the FDA approved the expansion of the KYPROLIS® U.S. prescribing information to include its use in combination with dexamethasone and DARZALEX®.5Repatha® (evolocumab)We market Repatha®, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), primarily in the United States and Europe. Repatha® was launched in 2015 and is indicated to reduce the risks of myocardial infarction, stroke and coronary revascularization in adults with established cardiovascular (CV) disease.Other Marketed ProductsWe also market a number of other products in various markets worldwide, including Nplate® (romiplostim), Vectibix® (panitumumab), MVASI® (bevacizumab-awwb), Parsabiv® (etelcalcetide), EPOGEN® (epoetin alfa), KANJINTI® (trastuzumab-anns), BLINCYTO® (blinatumomab), Aimovig® (erenumab-aooe), EVENITY® (romosozumab-aqqg), AMGEVITATM (adalimumab), Sensipar®/Mimpara® (cinacalcet), NEUPOGEN® (filgrastim), IMLYGIC® (talimogene laherparepvec), Corlanor® (ivabradine) and AVSOLA® (infliximab-axxq).PatentsThe following table lists our outstanding material patents for the indicated product by territory, general subject matter and latest expiry date.

A number of our marketed products are indicated for disease areas in which other products or treatments are currently available or are being pursued by our competitors through research and development (R&D) activities. Additionally, some competitor-marketed products target the same genetic pathways as our recently launched marketed products or are currently in development. This competition could impact the pricing and market share of our products. We continue to pursue ways of increasing the value of our medicines through innovations during their life cycles, which can include expanding the disease areas for which our products are indicated and finding new methods to make the delivery of our medicines easier and less costly. Such activities can offer important opportunities for differentiation. For example, we market the Neulasta® Onpro® kit, which provides physicians the opportunity to initiate the administration of the recommended dose of Neulasta® on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving patients a trip back to the doctor. We plan to continue pursuing innovation efforts to strengthen our competitive position. Such position may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience, delivery devices, price, reimbursement, access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration.Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have expired, and we face new and increasing competition, including from biosimilars and generics. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is “highly similar” to the original reference product. We expect that the adverse impact on our originator-product sales from biosimilar competition will reflect current trends and actual results given similar conditions. We also believe that when multiple biosimilar versions of one of our originator products get approved and launched, competition could intensify more rapidly, leading to net price declines for both reference and biosimilar products, resulting in a greater impact on our products’ sales. In the United States, companies have now launched biosimilar versions of EPOGEN®, NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta® and have approved biosimilars for ENBREL. See also Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Approval of Biosimilars. Although we expect competitor biosimilars to compete on price, we believe many patients, providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation, reliability and safety of our products. As additional biosimilar competitors come to market, we will leverage our global experience versus both branded and biosimilar competition.We also have our own biosimilar products both in the United States and outside of U.S. markets that are competing against branded and biosimilar versions of our competitors’ products. In 2019, Amgen launched MVASI®, a biosimilar to Avastin® (bevacizumab), and KANJINTI®, a biosimilar to Herceptin® (trastuzumab), in the United States; and AMGEVITATM, a biosimilar to Humira® (adalimumab) in Europe. We have also received FDA approval for AMJEVITATM (adalimumab-atto), a biosimilar to Humira®. In 2020, we launched AVSOLA®, a biosimilar to Remicade® (infliximab), and in January 2021, we launched RIABNITM, a biosimilar for Rituxan® (rituximab). We expect additional biosimilar competition against both our branded and biosimilar products in the future across all markets.8In addition, although most of our products are biologics, some are small molecule products. Because the FDA approval process permits generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product rather than having to conduct their own costly and time-consuming clinical trials, generic manufacturers can often develop and market their competing versions of our small molecule products at much lower prices. For example, following loss of exclusivity of patents directed to cinacalcet, the active ingredient in our small molecule calcimimetic Sensipar®, we lost a significant share of the market and corresponding revenues in a very short period of time. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The introduction of new products, the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result (i) in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents and/or (ii) in reductions in the prices we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. (As used in this document, the term clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials, observational studies, registries and other studies.) See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our products face substantial competition and Item 1A. Risk Factors—We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.9The following table reflects our significant competitors and is not exhaustive.ProductTerritoryCompetitor-marketed productCompetitorsENBRELU.S. & CanadaREMICADE®*Janssen Biotech, Inc.

In many markets around the world, these payers, including government health systems, private health insurers and other organizations, remain focused on reducing the cost of healthcare; and their efforts have intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs, economic pressures and broader challenges generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Drugs remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment. As a result, payers are becoming more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products and are scrutinizing the prices of these products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefits such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system. These pressures are intensified when our products are subject to competition, including from biosimilars.10In the United States, healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through both private-payer and government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. We provide negotiated rebates to healthcare providers, private payers, government payers and PBMs. In addition, we are required to (i) provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) provide discounts to qualifying healthcare providers under the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. Both private and government payers use formularies to manage access and utilization of drugs. A drug’s inclusion and favorable positioning on a formulary are essential to ensure patients have access to a particular drug. Even when access is available, some patients abandon their prescriptions for economic reasons. Payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization and/or spending altogether and/or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include, but are not limited to, more-limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance obligations, limitations on patients’ use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs), stricter utilization management criteria before a patient may get access to a drug, higher-tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs and formulary exclusion, which effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify and has thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales. Furthermore, during the past few years, many PBMs and insurers have consolidated, resulting in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria and/or exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. In highly competitive treatment markets such as the markets for ENBREL, Otezla®, Repatha® and Aimovig®, PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order for them to gain and/or maintain their formulary position.In addition to market actions taken by private and government payers in the United States, policy makers from both of the major U.S. political parties are pursuing policies to lower drug costs. Potential policies cover a wide range of areas, including allowing the importation of drugs from other countries; instituting international reference pricing (IRP) schemes, which would set the prices of certain drugs based on those available in other countries; establishing caps on price increases based on inflation metrics; increasing transparency on drug pricing; and using third-party value assessments to determine drug prices. Examples of such policies include the previous Administration’s November 2020 interim final rule, which attempts to institute most favored nation (MFN) IRP in Medicare Part B and final rule instituting rebate reform in Medicare Part D. Both of these rules are being challenged in court and therefore have not yet been implemented. The direction of drug pricing policy reforms remains unclear at this time.In many countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in mandates, incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many countries have health technology assessment organizations that use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine prices, coverage and reimbursement of new therapies; and these organizations are expanding in both established and emerging markets. Many countries also limit coverage to populations narrower than those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit utilization. We expect that countries will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies.11The dynamics and developments discussed above serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our products and the industry. Given the diverse interests in play between payers, biopharmaceutical manufacturers, policy makers, healthcare providers and independent organizations, if and whether the parties involved can achieve alignment on the matters discussed above remain unclear, and the outcome of any such alignment is difficult to predict. We remain focused on pricing our products responsibly and delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines. We do this by:•investing billions of dollars annually in R&D•developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably supplied biosimilars;•pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide;•partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes;•providing patient support and education programs; •helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and•working with policy makers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and where patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers.See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability and Item 1A. Risk Factors—Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw MaterialsManufacturingWe believe we are a leader in the manufacture of biologics and that our manufacturing capabilities represent a competitive advantage. The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Further, our expertise in the manufacture of biologics positions us well for leadership in the global biosimilars market. For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties.Our internal manufacturing network has commercial production capabilities for bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill, finish, tableting and device assembly. These activities are performed within the United States and its territories in our Puerto Rico, Rhode Island and California facilities as well as internationally in our Ireland, Netherlands and Singapore facilities. In addition, we use third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our commercial manufacturing network.To support our clinical trials, we manufacture product candidates primarily at our California facilities. We also use third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our overall clinical manufacturing network.See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products.DistributionWe operate distribution centers in Puerto Rico, Kentucky, California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. We also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide.OtherIn addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, each of our manufacturing locations includes key manufacturing support functions such as quality control, process development, engineering, procurement, production scheduling and warehousing. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as international regulatory agencies. See Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Regulation of Manufacturing Standards.12Manufacturing InitiativesWe have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network and/or by mitigating risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products. For example, our licensed next-generation biomanufacturing plant operating in Singapore incorporates multiple innovative technologies into a single facility and was built in half the construction time and at approximately half the operating cost of a traditional plant. Next-generation biomanufacturing plants require smaller manufacturing footprints and offer greater environmental benefits, including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower levels of carbon emissions. Within such plants, the equipment is portable and smaller, and some components are disposable, which provides greater flexibility and speed when manufacturing different medicines simultaneously. This eliminates the otherwise costly and complex retrofitting inherent in standard plants and enables Amgen to respond to changing demands for its medicines with increased agility, ultimately increasing the speed at which a medicine can become available for patients. The Singapore site also has a plant that has been approved to produce small molecule drugs for commercial manufacturing.In July 2018, we broke ground for our newest next-generation biomanufacturing plant at our West Greenwich, Rhode Island, campus. Construction on this new plant, the first of its kind in the United States, is complete. Upon approval by the FDA and global regulatory authorities, this plant will expand our capacity to manufacture certain products for U.S. and global markets.In 2019, we initiated projects to expand our manufacturing capabilities in Thousand Oaks, California, as well as at contract manufacturers. These investments will initially support clinical manufacturing but in the future may also be leveraged for commercial manufacturing.In September 2020, we entered into an arrangement with Lilly to manufacture Lilly’s potential COVID-19 therapies. For 2021—and, potentially, through 2022—we expect to allocate a portion of our manufacturing capacity to support this production. Additionally, starting in 2021, we will initiate projects that will expand our manufacturing capacity to enable supply of products and product candidates. These projects will employ new technologies that are being developed by Amgen that are anticipated to allow further optimization of our manufacturing network and processes.See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.Raw Materials and Medical DevicesCertain raw materials, medical devices (including companion diagnostics) and components necessary for the commercial and/or clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only sources for such materials. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by means of inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.We perform various procedures to help authenticate the sources of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. The procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform.To better ensure supply, Amgen has a risk mitigation strategy that uses a combination of methods, including multiple sources or backup inventory of critical raw materials. In response to COVID-19, we continue to closely monitor our inventory levels and have taken additional measures to mitigate against raw material supply interruption as part of our ongoing business continuity efforts. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products.Government RegulationRegulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities. To clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. Compliance with these standards is complex, and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant implications. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of factors, including global regulatory implications, that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial products.13Regulation in the United StatesIn the United States, the Public Health Service Act; the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA); and the regulations promulgated thereunder as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion and distribution of our products in addition to the reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals.Clinical Development and Product Approval. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky, and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are typically very long—approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable risk–benefit profile. We continue to work toward reducing cycle times by applying our expertise in human genetics and innovation in technology, clinical trials and real-world evidence.After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake an FDA-designated three-phase human clinical testing program.•In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects.•In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side-effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a patient population larger than phase 1 but still relatively small, who have the disease or condition under study.•In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of our product candidates, compared to commonly used treatments, in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s risk–benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of either a Biologics License Application for biologic products or a NDA for small molecule products. We are not permitted to market or promote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application.Approval of Biosimilars. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the nonclinical-trial and clinical-trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be “highly similar” and to have no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity and potency. The relevance of demonstrating “similarity” is that in many cases, biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators, because risk–benefit has previously been established. To preserve incentives for future innovation, the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators’ products, which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originator’s data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after initial FDA approval of the originator product. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. As part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars, the FDA released a number of guidance documents, some of which remain in draft form.Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of drug products. Our product promotions for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA and the FDA’s implemented regulations and guidance. The FDA’s review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses but is not limited to direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare-provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of the FDA’s advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDA’s regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. Additionally, as described below, such failure may lead to additional liability under U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse laws.14Regulation of Manufacturing Standards. The FDA regulates and inspects the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to granting approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to reinspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval.Regulation of Combination Products. Combination products are defined by the FDA as products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well.Regulation outside the United StatesIn European Union (EU) countries as well as in Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States.In the EU, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any EU member state: a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure, identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies. Regulatory review is led by one member state (the reference-member state), and its assessment—based on safety, quality and efficacy—is reviewed and approved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other member states from which the applicant is seeking approval (the concerned-member states). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products of Human Use (CHMP) adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the European Commission (EC) for final decision on granting of the marketing authorization. Even though the EC generally follows the CHMP’s opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval.In the EU, biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway, an applicant seeks and obtains regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired, relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is “highly similar” in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area.As a result of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the EU, the EMA in March 2019 relocated to Amsterdam. The United Kingdom officially left the EU in January 2020, and in December 2020, a new trade deal was agreed that starts to clarify how U.K. medicines will be independently supervised and where continued collaborations and recognitions can be expected. Amgen continues to monitor future negotiations to ensure no interruption in the supervision, regulation or supply of medicines in the United Kingdom and Europe.Other countries such as Russia, Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements.In Asia Pacific, a number of countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical-trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. In most of the Asian markets, registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU. In some markets in Asia, such as China, Indonesia and Thailand, the regulatory timelines can be less predictable. The regulatory process may also include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. Countries such as Australia and Japan have more-mature systems that would allow for submissions under more-competitive time frames. Regarding biosimilars, several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars (e.g., Australia, India, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), and biosimilar products are already present on the markets (e.g., Australia and South Korea).15In some countries, such as Japan and those in the EU, medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby manufacturers must establish that their medical devices conform to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category. For example, in the EU, with limited exceptions, medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformité Européenne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements.Postapproval PhaseAfter approval, we continue to monitor adverse events and product complaints reported following the use of our products through routine postmarketing surveillance and studies when applicable. We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies as required by local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports. We proactively monitor (according to good pharmacovigilance practices) and ensure the implementation of signal detection, assessment and the communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products. We also proactively monitor product complaints through our quality systems, which includes assessing our drug delivery devices for device complaints, adverse events and malfunctions. We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. Health regulators, including the FDA, have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product’s life cycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products.Health regulators, including the FDA, also have authority, before or after approval, to require a company to implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. In the United States, a risk management program is known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), and we currently have REMSs for Prolia®, Nplate® and BLINCYTO®.Other RegulationWe are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including antikickback laws and false-claims laws. Antikickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescribing of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False-claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the false-claims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying product (e.g., violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim.In 2012, Amgen entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), which was formally closed out in August 2018. On April 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations related to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines. Additionally, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that in the future, our practices might be further challenged under antikickback or similar laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA arguably includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws and/or regulations. Failure by our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators to comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws and/or regulations could result in significant civil or criminal penalties.We are subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection. These laws and regulations involve the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. The legislative and regulatory environments regarding privacy and data protection are continually evolving and developing, as these issues are the subjects of increasing amounts of attention in countries globally. For example, we are subject to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective on January 1, 2020. Other jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation and/or regulations. Failure to comply with these laws could result in significant penalties.16Our business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and regulations. See Reimbursement section above.Research and Development and Selected Product CandidatesWe focus our R&D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness. We capitalize on our strengths in human genetics, novel biology and protein engineering. We leverage our biologic expertise and take a modality-independent approach to R&D. And we use cutting-edge science and technology to study subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases.Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, other combination modalities or new modalities. We have reshaped our portfolio and have increasingly focused our efforts on human genetics when possible to enhance the likelihood of success.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we managed our clinical development on a case-by-case basis. Patients who were already enrolled in studies continued to receive study drug, including through direct-to-patient shipments. For studies that had the potential for significant benefit in a serious or life-threatening condition and when site resources enabled new patients to be enrolled safely and monitored closely, we continued enrollment. For clinical trials experiencing uncertainty with regard to the trial sites’ ability to ensure subject safety or data integrity at that time, we temporarily paused enrollment. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in providing care for these patients and providing investigational drug supply. To date, the majority of clinical trials that were paused at the onset of the pandemic to ensure subject safety or data integrity have resumed. Study enrollments were affected the most in the second quarter of 2020 and by the end of the year resumed to prepandemic levels, although COVID-19 infection rates and related vaccination activities may impact future patient enrollment. We continuously monitor and reevaluate the status of studies, pausing when uncertainty arises with regard to the trial sites’ ability to ensure safety or data integrity. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in providing care for these patients and in providing investigational drug supply. In addition, our R&D organization is supporting efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in a number of ways, including by (i) working to support production of therapeutic antibodies that could diminish the impact of COVID-19 on patients, (ii) joining a public–private partnership between leading companies in our industry and U.S. government health agencies to develop a strategy for a coordinated research response and (iii) participating in platform studies to investigate treatments in adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infections.For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our R&D expenses were $4.2 billion, $4.1 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.We have major R&D centers in Thousand Oaks and San Francisco, California; Iceland; and the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties.Our clinical trial activities are conducted by both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened clinical sites and will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Clinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also see Item 1A. Risk Factors—We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.Some of our competitors are actively engaged in R&D in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is greatly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, thereby contributing to a product’s eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position.In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal R&D efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and R&D technology rights and establish R&D arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing these R&D arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the R&D.17The following table shows a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 2, 2021, unless otherwise indicated. Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. (The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) The information in this section does not include other, nonregistrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication.We may conduct nonregistrational clinical trials for various reasons, including to evaluate real-world outcomes or to collect additional safety information with regard to the use of our products.18MoleculeDisease/conditionPhase 3 programsEVENITY®Male osteoporosisKYPROLIS®Weekly dosing for relapsed multiple myelomaNplate®Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopeniaOtezla®COVID-19Genital psoriasisMild-to-moderate psoriasisRepatha®Cardiovascular diseaseRIABNITMRheumatoid arthritisSotorasibNSCLC with KRAS G12C mutationsTezepelumabSevere asthmaABP 654Psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s diseaseABP 938Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathyABP 959Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)Phase 2 programsOlpasiran (formerly AMG 890)Cardiovascular diseaseRozibafusp alfa (formerly AMG 570)Systemic lupus erythematosusSotorasibAdvanced colorectal cancerOther solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutationsTezepelumabChronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseAMG 714/PRV-015Celiac diseasePhase 1 programsEfavaleukin alfa (formerly AMG 592)Inflammatory diseasesAMG 119Small-cell lung cancerAMG 133ObesityAMG 160Prostate cancerAMG 171ObesityAMG 176Hematologic malignanciesAMG 199Metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancerAMG 256Solid tumorsAMG 330Acute myeloid leukemiaAMG 397Hematologic malignanciesAMG 404Solid tumorsAMG 427Acute myeloid leukemiaAMG 506Solid tumorsAMG 509Prostate cancerAMG 594(1)Cardiovascular diseaseAMG 650Solid tumorsAMG 673Acute myeloid leukemiaAMG 701Multiple myelomaAMG 757Small-cell lung cancerAMG 910Gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer(1)In November 2020, we provided notice to Cytokinetics of termination of our collaboration effective May 20, 2021 and of our intention to transition to them the development and commercialization rights for omecamtiv mecarbil and AMG 594.Phase 3Clinical trials investigate the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of our product candidates, compared to commonly used treatments, in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.Phase 2Clinical trials investigate side-effect profiles and efficacy of product candidates in a larger patient population than phase 1, but still relatively small, who have the disease or condition under study.Phase 1Clinical trials investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of product candidates in a small number of human subjects.19Phase 3 Product Candidate Program ChangesAs of February 12, 2020, we had 14 phase 3 programs. As of February 2, 2021, we had 13 phase 3 programs, as regulatory approvals were received for three programs, two programs initiated phase 3 studies, two programs initiated biosimilarity studies, one concluded and one termination and transition of program to Cytokinetics.

Corresponding patent applications are pending in other jurisdictions. Additional patents may be filed or issued and may provide additional exclusivity for the product candidate or its use.Phases 3 and 2 Program DescriptionsThe following provides additional information about selected product candidates that have advanced into human clinical trials.EVENITY®EVENITY® is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of sclerostin. It is being evaluated as a treatment for male osteoporosis. EVENITY® is being developed in collaboration with UCB.20IMLYGIC®IMLYGIC® is an oncolytic immunotherapy derived from herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). A Phase 3 study evaluating IMLYGIC® in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) versus pembrolizumab alone for treatment of unresectable stage IIIB to IVM1c melanoma was stopped for futility after an interim analysis by the Data Monitoring Committee. No new safety signals were observed.KYPROLIS®KYPROLIS® is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor. It is being investigated for weekly dosing in combinations with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma.In August 2020, the FDA approved the expansion of the KYPROLIS® U.S. prescribing information to include its use in combination with DARZALEX® plus dexamethasone in two dosing regimens—once weekly and twice weekly—for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three previous lines of therapy.Nplate®Nplate® is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist. It is being investigated in phase 3 studies for chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.In December, the European Commission approved an expanded indication for use in adult patients who have had immune thrombocytopenia for 12 months or less and who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids or immunoglobulins. As noted above, the FDA has approved Nplate® for the treatment of hematopoietic syndrome of acute radiation syndrome.1OLPASIRANOlpasiran is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) that lowers lipoprotein(a), also known as Lp(a). It is being investigated in phase 2 for the treatment of atherosclerotic CV disease.Otezla®Otezla® is a small molecule that inhibits PDE4. It is being investigated in phase 3 studies for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, patients with moderate-to-severe genital psoriasis and, in collaboration with some of the members of the COVID R&D Alliance, adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19.In May 2020, we announced positive results from the ADVANCE trial, a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to assess the efficacy of Otezla® in adults with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis. The study showed that oral Otezla® 30 mg twice daily achieved a statistically significant improvement, compared with placebo, in the primary endpoint of the sPGA response at week 16. In addition, the week 16 secondary endpoints of achieving at least 75% improvement from baseline in the percent of affected body surface area (BSA), change in BSA total score from baseline and change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) total score from baseline were each also statistically significant for the treatment effect of Otezla® compared with placebo.Repatha®Repatha® is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits PCSK9. It is being investigated as a treatment for atherosclerotic CV disease in high-risk patients with high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) without prior heart attack or stroke.In March 2020, we announced positive results from the BEIJERINCK study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Repatha® in patients who are human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) and have high LDL-C despite stable background lipid-lowering therapy. The study demonstrated that treatment with Repatha® significantly reduced LDL-C.RIABNITMRIABNITM, a biosimilar candidate to Rituxan®/MabThera® (rituximab), is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. It is being investigated in a phase 3 study for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The reference-product primary conditions are non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis.1 Funding and execution of the pivotal study was provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Priority Review regulatory submission was conducted in partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).21In December 2020, we announced that the FDA had approved RIABNITM for the treatment of adult patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s granulomatosis), and microscopic polyangiitis. RIABNITM launched in the United States in January 2021.Rozibafusp alfa Rozibafusp alfa is a novel bispecific antibody-peptide conjugate that simultaneously blocks the B lymphocyte stimulator (BAFF) and inducible costimulatory ligand (ICOSL) activity. It is being investigated as a treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus.SotorasibSotorasib is a KRAS G12C small molecule inhibitor. It is being investigated as a treatment for a variety of solid tumors, including NSCLC, colorectal cancer and other solid tumor cancers.In December 2020, we announced that the FDA had granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for sotorasib for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation as determined by an FDA-approved test, following at least one prior systemic therapy. The sotorasib application is being reviewed under the FDA’s RTOR pilot program, which aims to explore a more efficient review process that ensures safe and effective treatments are made available to patients as early as possible.In January 2021, we announced phase 2 results from the CodeBreaK 100 clinical study, evaluating sotorasib in 126 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced NSCLC, who had failed a median of two prior lines of anticancer therapies (immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy). Sotorasib demonstrated a confirmed ORR (primary end point) and disease control rate of 37.1% and 80.6%, respectively, a median duration of response of 10 months and median progression-free survival of 6.8 months. Patients were treated with sotorasib 960 mg once daily orally.Tezepelumab Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of thymic stromal lymphopoietin. It is being evaluated in phase 3 as a treatment for severe asthma. It is also being investigated in phase 2 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Tezepelumab is being developed jointly in collaboration with AstraZeneca.In November 2020, we announced positive results from the registrational phase 3 NAVIGATOR trial, in which the investigational medicine tezepelumab demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in exacerbations compared to placebo in patients with severe asthma. The NAVIGATOR trial met the primary endpoint with tezepelumab added to SoC, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction compared to placebo plus SoC in the AAER over 52 weeks in the overall patient population. SoC consisted of medium- or high-dose ICS plus at least one additional controller medication with or without OCS.In December 2020, we announced that the SOURCE trial had not met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in the daily OCS dose, without loss of asthma control, with tezepelumab compared to placebo. The results of this trial have no impact on our submission plans.AMG 714/PRV-015AMG 714/PRV-015 is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin-15. It is being investigated for the treatment of celiac disease and is being developed in collaboration with Provention Bio.ABP 654ABP 654, a biosimilar candidate to STELARA® (ustekinumab), is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-12 and interleukin-23. It is being investigated in a phase 3 study for biosimilarity to STELARA®. The reference-product primary conditions are psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease.ABP 938ABP 938, a biosimilar candidate to EYLEA® (aflibercept), is a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) Fc fusion protein. It is being investigated in a phase 3 study for neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

It is being investigated in a phase 3 study for PNH. The reference-product primary conditions are PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).Business RelationshipsFrom time to time, we enter into business relationships, including joint ventures and collaborative arrangements, for the R&D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or product candidates. In addition, we acquire product and R&D technology rights and establish R&D collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed-product base. These arrangements generally provide for nonrefundable, upfront license fees, development and commercial-performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature.Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require counterparties to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of a business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.BeiGene, Ltd.On January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene, Ltd. (BeiGene) for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. Under the collaboration, BeiGene commenced selling XGEVA® and will commercialize KYPROLIS® and BLINCYTO® in China, and Amgen will share profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China of such products for a specified period.In addition, we will jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiGene sharing in global R&D costs by providing cash and development services up to $1.25 billion. Upon regulatory approval, BeiGene will assume commercialization rights in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiGene will share profits equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside of China, Amgen will also pay BeiGene royalties.NovartisWe are in a collaboration with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize Aimovig®. In the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly develop and collaborate on the commercialization of Aimovig®. Amgen, as the principal, recognizes product sales of Aimovig® in the United States, shares U.S. commercialization costs with Novartis and pays Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis holds global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig®. Novartis pays Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the Novartis-exclusive territories and funds a portion of global R&D expenses. In addition, Novartis will make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds are achieved with respect to Aimovig® in the United States. Amgen manufactures and supplies Aimovig® worldwide.We are currently involved in litigation with Novartis over our collaboration agreements for the development and commercialization of Aimovig®. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Bayer HealthCare LLCWe are in a licensing arrangement with Bayer HealthCare LLC (Bayer) for Nexavar®. In February 2020, we amended the terms of our agreement with Bayer, which transferred all of our operational responsibilities outside the United States to Bayer, including commercial and medical affairs activities. Prior to the amendment of the agreement, we shared equally in the profits outside the United States, excluding Japan. In lieu of this profit share, Bayer now pays us a royalty on sales of Nexavar® at a percentage rate in the low 30s. The rights to develop and market Nexavar® in Japan are reserved to Bayer. In the United States, Bayer pays us a royalty on sales of Nexavar® at a percentage rate in the high 30s.23DaVita Inc.In January 2017, we entered into a six-year supply agreement with DaVita Inc. (DaVita), which superseded the previously existing, seven-year supply agreement that commenced in 2012. Pursuant to the 2017 agreement, we supply EPOGEN® and Aranesp® in amounts necessary to meet specified annual percentages of DaVita’s and its affiliates’ requirements for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico. Such percentages vary during the term of the agreement, but in each year are at least 90%. The agreement expires in 2022. The agreement may be terminated by either party before expiration of its term in the event of certain breaches of the agreement by the other party.For financial information concerning our significant collaborative arrangements, see Part IV—Note 8, Collaborations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Human Capital ResourcesAmgen’s approach to human capital resource management starts with our mission to serve patients. Our industry exists in a complex regulatory and reimbursement environment. The unique demands of our industry, together with the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of innovative medicines, require talent that is highly educated and/or has significant industry experience. Additionally, for certain key functions, we require specific scientific expertise to oversee and conduct R&D activities and the complex manufacturing requirements for biopharmaceutical products.As of December 31, 2020, Amgen had approximately 24,300 staff members, and we have had relatively low global turnover rates. We consider our staff relations to be good; supported by our regular staff engagement assessments, with surveys on a wide range of topics (including engagement in the COVID-19 environment, diversity, inclusion and belonging and ethics). We discuss the results of these surveys with our Board of Directors. Compensation, Benefits and DevelopmentOur approach to employee compensation and benefits is designed to deliver cash, equity and benefit programs that are competitive with those offered by leading companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries to attract, motivate and retain talent with a focus on encouraging performance, promoting accountability and adherence to Company values and alignment with the interests of the Company’s shareholders.Our base pay program aims to compensate staff members relative to the value of the contributions of their role, which takes into account the skills, knowledge and abilities required to perform each position, as well as the experience brought to the job. We also provide annual incentive programs to reward our staff in alignment with achievement of Company-wide goals that are established annually and designed to drive aspects of our strategic priorities that support and advance our strategy across our Company. The majority of our staff members are also eligible for the grant of equity awards under our long-term incentive program that are designed to align the experience of these staff with that of our shareholders. All staff also participate in a regular performance measurement process that aligns pay to performance and through which staff receive performance and development feedback. To support the development of our staff, we provide a variety of programs, including leadership development programs, virtual instructor-led courses and self-paced learning options.Our benefit programs are also generally broad-based, promote health and overall well-being and emphasize saving for retirement. All regular U.S. staff members are eligible to participate in the same core health and welfare and retirement savings plans. Other U.S. employee benefits include medical plans, dental plans, access to childcare, employee assistance programs, employee stock purchase plan, flexible spending accounts, life, long-term care and business travel accident insurance, short and long-term disability benefits, wellness benefits and work-life resources and referrals. Comparable programs and benefits are available globally, with the same health and well-being intent, consistent with statutory requirements.Our Compensation and Management Development Committee provides oversight of our compensation plans, policies and programs.24Safety and Wellness and Our Response to COVID-19Creating a safe and healthy workplace for our staff is a priority at Amgen. Our goal is to have a world class safety record through safety leadership, risk management practices and integrating safety throughout our business processes. To foster our safety culture, we implement a comprehensive safety program, driving to understand and mitigate the root cause of safety incidents and manage and control variability. We use leading indicators to assess the effectiveness of our safety programs and make course corrections as needed. Additionally, we perform formal executive management review of functional safety performance for Operations, Global Commercial Operations and R&D on a quarterly basis with a focus on identifying early signals and taking action to drive continuous improvement. Based on our 2019 performance, compared to a benchmark of twelve companies in the pharmaceutical industry, Amgen was in the quartile with the lowest injury rate.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and as part of our commitment to work to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, we have activated our applicable business continuity plans, including having those of our employees who are able to work from home to do so since mid-March 2020. For employees returning to the workplace and the field, we have also taken additional safety measures, including implementing occupancy limits, restricting business travel, providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, temperature screening and COVID-19 testing to access our workplaces.Our Corporate Responsibility and Compliance Committee provides general oversight of our safety programs and initiatives, while our Board of Directors, as a whole, has overseen our specific responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.Diversity, Inclusion and BelongingWe believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation, which supports our ability to serve patients. Further, we also believe our global presence is strengthened by having a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients we serve. It is with these beliefs in mind that we have continued to strengthen and grow our culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging. Our internal efforts include, in 2019, establishing a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Council chaired by our Chief Executive Officer. In 2020, we implemented a global unconscious bias training program, and launched a portal devoted to diversity, inclusion and belonging that includes learning and resources. Further, we are leveraging our Employee Resource Groups (listed below) to represent and support the diversity of Amgen staff: Employee Resource GroupsAmgen Asian Association (AAA)Amgen Black Employee Network (ABEN)Ability Bettered through Leadership and Education (ABLE), a resource group for the physically or cognitively disabledAmgen Early Career Professionals (AECP)Amgen Indian Subcontinent Network (AISN)Amgen Latin Employee Network (ALEN)Amgen LGBTQ and Allies Network (PRIDE)Amgen Veterans Employees Network (AVEN)Women Empowered to be Exceptional (WE2)Women in Information Systems Enrichment (WISE)In areas of underrepresentation, we develop plans with a goal of bringing our representation in line with availability, and we also engage in outreach efforts to attract, retain and advance more women and minorities in our workforce. For example, we have worked to enhance our diverse candidate recruiting pool by developing relationships with organizations that can serve as a source of diverse candidates, such as the National Black MBA Association and National Sales Network, as well as historically black colleges and universities. Additionally, at the end of 2020, we became a founding member of OneTen, a coalition of 35 of the world’s largest, best-known companies, that aims to hire one million Black Americans (with a specific focus on those without four-year college degrees) into good-paying, family-sustaining jobs over the next ten years. Other examples of actions that we are taking in this area include investment and participation in Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association (a global organization focused on development and business networking for women in healthcare) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Anderson School of Management women’s leadership program.25In an effort to provide additional transparency into the makeup of our workforce, we intend to disclose our 2020 Consolidated EEO-1 Report after our submission of the report to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.Our Corporate Responsibility and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on workforce diversity and inclusion.Information about Our Executive OfficersThe executive officers of the Company as of February 8, 2021, are set forth below.

(These website addresses are not intended to function as hyperlinks, and the information contained in our website and in the SEC’s website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.SUMMARYRisks Related to Economic Conditions and Operating a Global Business, Including During the COVID-19 Pandemic•The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations.•A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation.•Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.27Risks Related to Government Regulations and Third-Party Policies•Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability.•Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.•The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.•Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.Risks Related to Competition•Our products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition.•Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.•We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.•Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.Risks Related to Research and Development•We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&D.•We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.•Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.•Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.•Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products.•Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions.Risks Related to Operations•We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.•We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.•Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.General Risk Factors•Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.•Our stock price is volatile•We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.28RISKS RELATED TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS, INCLUDING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMICThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations.The novel coronavirus identified in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, is an ongoing global pandemic that has resulted in public and governmental efforts to contain or slow the spread of the disease, including widespread shelter-in-place orders, social distancing interventions, quarantines, travel restrictions and various forms of operational shutdowns. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting measures implemented in response to the pandemic are adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business (including our R&D, clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development and sales activities), the business activities of our suppliers, customers, third-party payers and our patients. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval, and see also We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Due to the pandemic and these measures and their effects, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products, and in some cases, have experienced, and could continue to experience, unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products.Our clinical trials have been, and are expected to continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have clinical work ongoing at investigational sites across the globe. A number of clinical trial sites, including those in regions experiencing new or resurgent outbreaks of COVID-19, have restricted site visits and imposed restrictions on the initiation of new clinical trials and/or patient visits to protect both site staff and patients from possible COVID-19 exposure that has stopped or slowed clinical trial activities. In response to the safety concerns related to COVID-19, we have suspended, and will continue to suspend, enrollment and screening in clinical trials where sites are unable to perform clinical trial work due to COVID-19 or there is uncertainty around the ability of sites to ensure subject safety or data integrity. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our ability to enroll or to continue to enroll certain required post-marketing studies, including pediatric studies. While many of our clinical trial activities have recommenced over the course of 2020, the initial disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to our clinical trials and our clinical trial plans and timelines, and any similar future disruptions (including as a result of the current surge and lockdowns in numerous regions), may have a significant adverse effect on our product development and launches, and, in turn, on future product sales, business and results of operations. For example, to ensure patient safety we initially paused enrollment of our sotorasib Phase 1 combination cohort with Keytruda® and Phase 3 lung cancer study, and such interruptions in enrollment may ultimately affect the timeline of these or other studies. Additionally, while we are investing in research, collaborations and operational support to potentially develop and/or produce treatments for COVID-19, such activities may not result in therapeutic candidates, product approvals, successful production and/or significant commercial value being derived from potential COVID-19-related medicines.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, regulatory delays, including delays in receiving regulatory advice, reviews of applications, or performance of inspections required for approvals. The pandemic may also result in greater regulatory uncertainty. For example, the FDA and the EMA have issued guidance to provide biopharmaceutical manufacturers greater flexibility in certain regulatory areas, including protocol deviations and adverse event reporting. However, such flexibility may result in greater uncertainty regarding the expectations of such health authorities in relation to this guidance. Additionally, there may be delays in ongoing or new patent office or patent proceedings in the United States or internationally that may delay the outcome of such proceedings. Such delays and disruptions could have a significant adverse effect on our product development and launches, product sales, business and results of operations.29In response to COVID-19, we have activated our applicable business continuity plans, including suspending U.S. in-person meetings and interactions with the healthcare community and professionals in a substantial number of states, suspending, as a general matter, all international business travel and the majority of domestic travel within the United States, and U.S. employees who are able to work from home have been doing so since mid-March 2020. Our ability to perform critical functions and maintain operations have been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected as a result of such workforce restrictions, and the COVID-19-related support programs we have put into place for our staff, suppliers and customers have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, our operating expenses and reduce the efficiency of our operations. Notwithstanding such support programs, the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on the health and availability of our workforce, as well as those of the third parties on which we rely, could have an adverse effect on our business. If members of our management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization are unable to perform their duties or have limited availability due to COVID-19, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy and our operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including transportation and supply chains, have adversely affected, and continue to adversely affect, the efficiency of our business operations. Also, the transition of the majority of our workforce to a remote work environment in response to COVID-19, as well as that of our third-party service providers, have exacerbated certain risks to our business, including, but not limited to, those associated with an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of cybersecurity attacks (including social engineering attacks), and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or our proprietary or confidential information. As the pandemic continues to progress, we have observed an increase in cybersecurity incidents, predominantly ransomware and social engineering attacks, experienced by our third-party service providers. Further, government entities have also been the subject of cyberattacks. The EMA disclosed in December 2020 that it had been the subject of a cyberattack that targeted and accessed third-party documents relating to regulatory submissions, and that such documents were published on the internet (some of which were manipulated prior to publication). Such third-party and governmental incidents have created the risk of the loss of availability and/or control of information (including information related to our clinical trials) important to the operation of our business. See A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation. In the future, as the pandemic progresses and afterwards, we may experience significant adverse effects on our commercial and clinical manufacturing activities, our operations, and our cybersecurity, and our suppliers and vendors may also experience significant disruptions to their activities and operations on which we depend, as a result of these cybersecurity incidents.Federal, state and local, and international governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 also have resulted in the cancellation or delay of diagnostic, elective, specialty and other procedures and appointments to avoid non-essential patient exposure to medical environments and potential infection with COVID-19 and to focus limited resources and personnel capacity toward the treatment of COVID-19. These measures and challenges will likely continue to varying degrees for the duration of the pandemic and have significantly reduced patient access to, and administration of, certain of our drugs. For example, Prolia® is a product requiring administration by a healthcare provider in doctors’ offices or other healthcare settings that are affected by COVID-19. The U.S. label for Prolia® instructs healthcare professionals who discontinue Prolia® to transition the patient to an alternative antiresorptive, including oral treatments that do not require administration by a healthcare provider. Further, as a result of COVID-19, oncology patients, in consultation with their doctors, may be selecting less immunosuppressive therapies or therapies that do not require administration in a hospital setting, potentially adversely affecting certain of our products. Also, new patients are less likely to be diagnosed and/or to start therapeutics during the pandemic. Once the pandemic subsides, we anticipate there will be a substantial backlog of patients seeking appointments with physicians relating to a variety of medical conditions, and as a result, patients seeking treatment with certain of our products may have to navigate limited provider capacity, and this limited provider capacity could have a continued adverse effect on our sales following the opening up of various geographies and/or the end of the pandemic. Further, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in long-term shifts in preferences among healthcare professionals and patients toward treatments that do not require administration by healthcare professionals or visits to medical facilities.30The legislative and regulatory environment governing our businesses is dynamic and changing frequently in response to COVID-19. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased interest in compulsory licenses, march-in rights or other governmental interventions, both in the United States and internationally, related to the procurement of drugs, such as the WHO’s COVID-19 Technology Access Pool initiative, which provides an approach for sharing all intellectual property, information and clinical trial data necessary to enable generic drug manufacturing. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation. Further, the challenges of the pandemic have resulted in the exploration of signification legislation to address the need to supply medicines to address COVID-19. Pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency in the United States in March 2020 under the Stafford Act, state and local governments may request access to discounted pricing for certain items related to the COVID-19 response. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act implements initiatives to provide advanced payments from Medicare to healthcare providers, clinics and physicians and to require Medicare plans to provide up to a 90-day supply of Part D drugs. However, despite such initiatives and government support, there may be adverse effects on the timing and collectability of our customer receivables as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in a significant increase in unemployment and underemployment which may continue after the pandemic. Such a significant increase in unemployment or other disruptions in the labor market have led to a substantial reduction in disposable income and, in the U.S., access to healthcare insurance, including reductions in the commercially insured population that has led to growth (and is expected to continue to lead to growth) in Medicaid enrollment, which has adversely affected our product sales. See Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Such reduction in healthcare insurance could be compounded by any full or partial repeal of the ACA by the U.S. Supreme Court. Further, globally, the substantial pressures placed on governmental and payor budgets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the projected governmental budget shortfalls caused by significantly reduced economic activity during and potentially after the COVID-19 pandemic, together with the long-term impact from the pressures on healthcare systems, may result in greater and continued downward price pressure on biopharmaceutical products and increased intensity of stakeholder negotiations across the biopharmaceutical value chain. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability.As the pandemic continues, and if conditions worsen or if the duration of the pandemic extends significantly, we expect to experience additional adverse effects on our operational and commercial activities, customer purchases and our collections of accounts receivable. It is unclear which adverse effects may be material, and it remains uncertain the degree to which these adverse effects would impact our future operational and commercial activities, customer purchases and our collections even if conditions begin to improve. There was a resurgence in COVID-19 infections in numerous jurisdictions in the autumn of 2020 and winter of 2020-2021, resulting in the reinstatement of stricter restrictions and shutdowns in a number of jurisdictions. It is expected that the pandemic will continue to ebb and flow, with different jurisdictions having higher levels of infections than others over the course of the pandemic. In addition to existing travel restrictions, jurisdictions may continue or reinstate border closures, impose or reimpose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity, which could significantly affect our ability to support our operations and customers and the ability of our employees to get to their workplaces to discover, study, develop and produce our product candidates and products, disrupt the movement of our products through the supply chain, and prevent or discourage patients from seeking healthcare services and the administration of certain of our products. Further, in connection with the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and in an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical products, we or our suppliers may elect to, or governments may require us or our suppliers to, allocate manufacturing capacity (for example pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act) in a way that adversely affects our regular operations, customer relationships and financial results. In the U.S., on January 21, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order instructing federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including the Defense Production Act, to improve current and future pandemic response and biological threat preparedness. The rapid reallocation of resources for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, including the production of COVID-19 vaccinations or related therapies, such as our agreement to contribute to the production of one of Lilly’s potential COVID-19 antibody therapies, could also result in increased competition for, or reduced availability of, materials used in the manufacturing or distribution of our products. In addition, unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products could exceed our capacity to meet such demand, which could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships.31The COVID-19 pandemic and the volatile global economic conditions stemming from it may precipitate or amplify the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, which could materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial conditions and results. For example, if a natural disaster or other potentially disruptive event occurs concurrently with the COVID-19 pandemic, such disaster or event could deplete our inventory levels and we could experience a disruption to our manufacturing or ability to supply our products. Further, the global pandemic has exacerbated geopolitical tensions, and some countries, such as China, may be especially vulnerable to such dynamics. If relations between the United States and China or other governments deteriorates, our business and investments in China or other such markets may also be adversely affected. See Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic preclude any prediction as to the ultimate effect of COVID-19 on us. The duration of the measures being taken by the authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19 (including the distribution of vaccines), and the extent to which such measures are effective, if at all, remain highly uncertain. The magnitude and degree of COVID-19’s adverse effect on our business (including our product development, product sales, operating results, and resulting cash flows) and financial condition will be driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic’s effect on the United States and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state, local and international governmental responses to the pandemic. If the spread continues at or near its current trajectory or mitigation continues to require similar levels of shelter-in-place and shut-down orders, any adverse effects of COVID-19 will likely grow and could be enduring and our business and financial position could be materially adversely affected.A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation.To achieve our business objectives, we rely on sophisticated information technology systems, including software, mobile applications, cloud services and network-connected control systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties. Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business, result in significant costs and/or adversely affect our reputation.Our information technology systems are highly integrated into our business, including our R&D efforts, our clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and our product sales and distribution processes. Further, as the majority of our employees are working remotely, our reliance on our and third-party information technology systems has increased substantially and is expected to continue to increase. The complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions. Our systems are also subject to frequent cyberattacks. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Such attacks could include the use of harmful and virulent malware, including ransomware or other denials of service, that can be deployed through various means, including the software supply chain, e-mail, malicious websites and/or the use of social engineering. Attacks such as those experienced by governmental entities (including those that approve and/or regulate our products, such as the EMA) and other multi-national companies, including some of our peers, could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access or protect important data, and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, including developing, gaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing, selling and/or distributing our products. For example, in 2017, a pharmaceutical company experienced a cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted its operations, including its research and sales operations and the production of some of its medicines and vaccines. As a result of the cyberattack, its orders and sales for certain products in certain markets were negatively affected. In December 2020, SolarWinds Corporation, a leading provider of software for monitoring and managing information technology infrastructure, disclosed that it had suffered a cybersecurity incident whereby attackers had inserted malicious code into legitimate software updates for its products that were installed by myriad private and government customers, enabling the attackers to access a backdoor to such systems. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations for a discussion of the cyberattack on the EMA.Our systems also contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory information, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials and/or personal information belonging to us, our staff, our patients, customers and/or other parties. In some cases, we utilize third-party service providers to process, store, manage or transmit such data, which may increase our risk. Intentional or inadvertent data privacy or security breaches (including cyberattacks) or lapses by employees, service providers (including providers of information technology-specific services), nation states (including groups associated with or supported by foreign intelligence agencies), organized crime organizations, “hacktivists” or others, create risks that our sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons, our competitors, or the public. 32Domestic and global government regulators, our business partners, suppliers with whom we do business, companies that provide us or our partners with business services and companies we may acquire may face similar risks, and security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security, leave us without access to important systems, products, raw materials, components, services or information or expose our confidential data. For example, in 2019, two vendors that perform testing and analytical services that we use in developing and manufacturing our products have experienced cyberattacks, and in April and September of 2020, vendors that provide us with information technology services and clinical data services, respectively, each experienced ransomware attacks. Each of these incidents required us to disconnect our systems from those vendors’ systems. While we were able to reconnect our systems following restoration of these vendor’s capabilities without significantly affecting product availability, a more extended service outage affecting these or other vendors, particularly where such vendor is the single source from which we obtain the services, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we distribute our products in the United States primarily through three pharmaceutical wholesalers, and a security breach that impairs the distribution operations of our wholesalers could significantly impair our ability to deliver our products to healthcare providers and patients.Although we have experienced system breakdowns, attacks and information security breaches, we do not believe such breakdowns, attacks and breaches have had a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We continue to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical and/or sensitive data and systems. However, there can be no assurances that our efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks, and/or breaches of our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss or exposure of critical, proprietary, private, confidential or otherwise sensitive data, which could result in material financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us or negatively affect our stock price. While we maintain cyber-liability insurance, our insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses that could potentially result from a service interruption, breach of our systems or loss of our critical or sensitive data.We are also subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection, including laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. The legislative and regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection is continuously evolving and developing and the subject of significant attention globally. For example, we are subject to the EU’s GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective in January 2020, both of which provide for substantial penalties for non-compliance. Other jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation and/or regulations. Failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction, both independently and through collaborations such as our collaboration with BeiGene, of our products in new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Our international business, including in China and emerging market countries, may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including issues of geopolitical relations, the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions and/or sovereign debt issues. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements including those previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets. See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Our expansion efforts in China and emerging markets around the world is dependent upon the establishment of an environment that is predictable, navigable and supportive of biopharmaceutical innovation, sustained access for our products and limited pricing controls. For example, China continues to strengthen regulations on the collection, use and transmission of Chinese human genetic resources, and has expanded regulations on the conduct of biotechnology R&D activities in China. Our applications to the Human Genetic Resources Administration of China (HGRAC) seeking approval to conduct clinical trials in China are delayed pending further guidance from HGRAC. Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, trade restrictions or other barriers designed to protect industry in the home country against foreign competition, far-reaching antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations and/or evolving legal and regulatory environments. 33As we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. In addition, we have a number of financial instruments referencing the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). On July 27, 2017, the U.K Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administrator after 2021, and it is anticipated that LIBOR will be phased out and replaced by 2023. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to ease the financial burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. While various replacement reference rates have been proposed, an alternative reference rate to LIBOR has not yet been widely adopted, and the specific mechanisms to replace LIBOR in our existing LIBOR-linked financial instruments have not been finalized. As such, the replacement of LIBOR could have an adverse effect on the market for, or value of, our LIBOR-linked financial instruments. See Part IV, Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies—Recent accounting pronouncements. We are also subject to the economic and political uncertainties stemming from the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” which occurred on January 31, 2020. While our manufacturing and packaging activities take place largely outside the United Kingdom, minimizing the need to make costly and significant changes to those operations, we have nevertheless been working to put in place contingency plans to attempt to mitigate the effects of Brexit on us. Overall, the legal and operational challenges of our international business operations, along with government controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products, may result in material adverse effects on our international product sales, business and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND THIRD-PARTY POLICIESOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability.Sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to manage drug utilization and contain costs. These payers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom payers will reimburse. Continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs, together with payer dynamics, have limited, and are likely to continue to limit, our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the United States, particularly over the past few years, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced in an attempt to lower drug prices. These include proposals that would allow the U.S. government to negotiate drug price directly, limit drug reimbursement based on prices abroad or permit importation of drugs from Canada. Proposals focused on drug pricing are likely to continue to be proposed and may be adopted and implemented in some form.34—Changing U.S. federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices have affected and may continue to affect access to, pricing and sales of our productsA substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by federal and state governments. See Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. Our business has been and will continue to be affected by legislative actions changing U.S. federal reimbursement policy. Since late 2018, Congressional focus on drug pricing has increased, placing our industry under greater Congressional scrutiny. For example, in early 2019, the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee sent letters to twelve different biopharmaceutical manufacturers, including Amgen, seeking documents and detailed information about such companies’ drug pricing practices. Subsequently, in the fall of 2020, the House Oversight and Reform Committee released staff reports and held hearings with executives from six biopharmaceutical manufacturers, including Amgen, about their companies’ drug pricing practices. Also, between 2019 and 2020, a number of other Congressional committees held hearings and evaluated proposed legislation on drug-pricing and payment policy. For example, in 2019, the Senate Finance Committee advanced a bill that would, among other things, penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers for raising prices on drugs covered by Medicare Parts B and/or D faster than the rate of inflation, cap out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and require higher/additional manufacturer discounts in Medicare Part D. Additionally, in late 2019, a drug-pricing bill, H.R. 3, passed the House of Representatives, which would, among other things, enable direct price negotiations by the federal government on certain drugs (with the maximum price paid by Medicare capped by prices derived from an international index), includes a penalty for failing to reach agreement with the government, and requires that manufacturers offer these negotiated prices to other payers. We expect H.R. 3, or some similar proposed legislation, to be debated by Congress this year. Additional legislative or regulatory proposals have been introduced by members of Congress and the prior Administration that, if enacted and implemented in whole or in part, could also affect access to and sales of our products, including, but not limited to, proposals to allow importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries and to set Medicare payment rates using international price referencing. Further, in mid-2020, the prior Administration announced a number of Executive Orders intended to reduce the cost of biopharmaceuticals for patients, including a MFN policy for Medicare Parts B and D, under which the HHS was directed to take steps to implement payment models that set Medicare purchase prices based on the lowest price available in economically comparable countries for certain Part B and Part D medicines. In September 2020, in response to the corresponding Executive Order, HHS released a final rule to allow states (or other nonfederal government entities) to submit proposals to the FDA allowing for the importation of certain nonbiologic prescription drugs from Canada. Currently, the rule is being challenged by litigation, however, should such litigation be unsuccessful and should the Secretary of HHS authorize state proposals for importation, this rule could allow the importation of Canadian versions of certain of Amgen’s products (including Otezla®), that could have a material adverse effect on Amgen’s business. Further, in November 2020, also in response to the corresponding Executive Order, HHS released an interim final rule to implement the MFN pricing approach. If implemented, the MFN rule would set the reimbursement rate for 50 Medicare Part B drugs (including our products, such as Prolia®, XGEVA®, KYPROLIS®, Neulasta®, Nplate®, EPOGEN® and Aranesp®) equal to the lowest adjusted price for such products of the 22 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations. Lawsuits have been filed by certain trade groups challenging the implementation of this MFN rule based on, among other things, procedural defects. Late in 2020, in the case filed by the Biotechnology Industry Organization and others, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction preventing the rule from taking effect nationwide, pending the government’s completion of required administrative procedures. The case was subsequently stayed by the court and the parties were ordered to file a joint status report by April 23, 2021. Another case, filed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and others in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, was also stayed. Notwithstanding these stays, the MFN rule’s approach to drug pricing and other similar approaches, remain of interest. Further, despite the change in Administration, we expect continued significant focus on healthcare and similar drug pricing proposals, including proposals similar to the MFN rule, for the foreseeable future.Our business has been, and is expected to continue to be, affected by changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy resulting from federal regulations and federal demonstration projects. For example, the previous Administration released a drug pricing blueprint in 2018 which introduced an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition, improve the negotiating power of the federal government, reduce drug prices and lower patient out-of-pocket costs with the potential to significantly affect, whether individually or collectively, our industry. Such policy ideas included, but were not limited to, moving coverage and reimbursement for Medicare Part B drugs into Medicare Part D and instituting a competitive acquisition program for Part B drugs in which competing third-party vendors take on the financial risk of acquiring drugs and billing Medicare.35Also, over the past three years, federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), announced a number of recommendations, policies, proposals and demonstration projects to implement various elements of the drug pricing blueprint. CMS is the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare and overseeing state Medicaid programs and Health Insurance Marketplaces and has substantial power to implement policy changes or demonstration projects that can quickly and significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. CMS issued guidance to allow certain Medicare plans offered by private insurance companies to require that patients receiving Medicare Part B drugs first try a drug preferred by the plan before covering another therapy (Step Therapy) and lowered reimbursement rates for new Medicare Part B drugs. Further, HHS issued a final rule under Medicare Part D revising the regulations under the federal antikickback statute to encourage PBMs to use rebates received from biopharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce patient cost-sharing at the point of sale. Changes to the regulations will be phased-in beginning on March 22, 2021, with all changes effective as of January 1, 2023. However, there are numerous logistical hurdles to overcome before such rule can be effectively implemented and it is unclear how PBMs will change their business practices in response. Furthermore, a trade association representing PBMs recently filed litigation challenging this HHS final rule. Given these uncertainties, it remains unclear when any anticipated benefits to patients will materialize. The incoming Administration also could develop and seek to advance a range of policy proposals that could impact U.S. federal reimbursement policy for drugs and biologics. CMS policy changes and demonstration projects to test new care, delivery and payment models can significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), CMS uses bundled payment rates. Between 2018 and 2020, Sensipar® and Parsabiv®, our calcimimetics that are used in dialysis clinics, were eligible for temporary drug add-on payment adjustments (TDAPA) to the bundled rate. In November 2020, CMS released its final rule ending the TDAPA for calcimimetics and adjusting ESRD Prospective Payment System bundled rates on January 1, 2021 by $9.93 per dialysis treatment for calcimimetics, and we expect the sales of our calcimimetics to be materially adversely affected by this rule change. Additionally, CMS created a new mandatory payment model effective January 1, 2021 focused on encouraging greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for ESRD patients that could result in changes to treatment of dialysis patients, including reduction of the use of our ESAs. Further, back in November 2019, CMS announced additional voluntary payment models for nephrologists and dialysis facility partners that also seek to encourage home dialysis and preemptive transplantation through increased risk sharing, but due to COVID-19, the start date of such programs has been pushed back to April 1, 2021. CMS has also solicited suggestions regarding other potential care models. In 2016, CMS initiated the Oncology Care Model demonstration, which provides participating physician practices with performance-based financial incentives that aim to manage or reduce Medicare costs without negatively affecting the efficacy of care, that has been extended by one year (to 2022) due to COVID-19. We believe the Oncology Care Model has reduced utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and expect it to continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in late 2019, CMS announced a request for information on the Oncology Care First model, a new voluntary model that builds on the Oncology Care Model. CMS recently finalized a rule that, starting January 1, 2023, unless a manufacturer can ensure that the full amount of manufacturer patient assistance programs is passed on to the patient, such amount will be treated as a price reduction that will be taken into account when reporting our Best Price and/or Average Manufacturer Price (AMP). Given the use by PBMs and insurers of copay accumulator adjustment programs to apply such patient assistance for the benefit of such companies and not to defray costs to patients, it could be difficult to impossible for manufacturers to ensure that the full value of such amounts is being passed on to the patient. This new policy, if implemented, would have significant implications for our ability to offer copay assistance programs.In this dynamic environment, we are unable to predict which or how many federal policy, legislative, regulatory, executive or administrative changes may ultimately be, or effectively estimate the consequences to our business if, enacted and implemented. However, to the extent that these or other federal government initiatives further decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us, limit or affect our decisions regarding the pricing of or otherwise reduce the use of our U.S. products, or limit our ability to offer co-pay payment assistance to commercial patients, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. U.S. government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a biopharmaceutical manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.36—Changing reimbursement and pricing actions in various states have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, access to, and have affected, and may continue to affect, sales of our productsAt the state level, government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. A number of states have adopted, and many other states are considering, drug importation programs or other new pricing actions, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers publicly to report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or place a maximum price ceiling or cap on biopharmaceutical products. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions. For example, a California law, the constitutionality of which is currently being challenged, purports to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds. Similar laws exist in Oregon and Washington. States are also seeking to change the way they pay for drugs for patients covered by state programs. California adopted a 2020-21 budget that incorporates international pricing into Medicaid supplemental rebate negotiations and allows its Medicaid program to seek federal approval to extend supplemental rebates to non-Medicaid populations. New York, Massachusetts and Ohio have established Medicaid drug spending caps, and additional states may consider doing so as they face budget deficits from the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Vermont have enacted laws, and several other states have proposed laws, to facilitate the importation of drugs from Canada. Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs. Ultimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.—U.S. commercial payer actions have affected and may continue to affect access to and sales of our productsPayers, including healthcare insurers, PBMs, integrated healthcare delivery systems (vertically-integrated organizations built from the consolidation of healthcare insurers and PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their costs. With increasing frequency, payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater proportion of drug costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient copay or coinsurance obligations and more significant limitations on patients’ use of manufacturer commercial copay assistance programs. Further, government regulation of payers may affect these trends. For example, CMS recently finalized a policy that could cause commercial payers to adopt copay accumulator adjustment programs more widely. Payers have sought, and will likely continue to seek, price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as Step Therapy, or requiring that patients receive the payer’s prior authorization before covering the product or that patients use a mail-order pharmacy or a limited network of payer fully-owned mail-order or specialty pharmacies. Payers may also choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, some payers require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha® has been prescribed meet payer utilization management criteria, and these requirements have limited, and may continue to limit, patient access to Repatha® treatment. In an effort to reduce barriers to access, we reduced the net price of Repatha® by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers, including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. However, affordability of patient out-of-pocket co-pay cost has limited and may continue to limit patient use. For example, in late 2018 and early 2019, in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha® prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha® available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients, particularly those on Medicare and on December 31, 2019, we discontinued the higher list price option for Repatha®. Despite these net and list price reductions, some payers have restricted, and may continue to restrict, patient access and may change formulary coverage for Repatha®, seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha®. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, and negatively affect Repatha® sales.37Further, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs, which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discount and rebate requirements and limiting patient access and usage. For example, in the United States, in 2020, the top five integrated health plans and PBMs controlled about 85% of all pharmacy prescriptions. The consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including through integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mail-order pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers, and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers. In 2019 and 2020, CVS and Express Scripts created Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their respective leverage to negotiate deeper discounts. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Policy reforms advanced by Congress or the Administration that refine the role of PBMs in the U.S. marketplace could have downstream implications or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities.—Government and commercial payer actions outside the United States have affected and will continue to affect access to and sales of our productsOutside the United States, we expect countries will also continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures. See Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. IRP has been widely used by many countries outside the United States to control costs based on an external benchmark of a product’s price in other countries. IRP policies can change quickly and frequently and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. In addition, countries may refuse to reimburse or may restrict the reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or to meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds. For example, despite the EMA’s approval of Repatha® for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, the reimbursement for Repatha® in France is limited to a narrower patient population (such as those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) following a national health technology assessment. While the pricing and reimbursement process in that country remains ongoing, the assessment currently limits our efforts in France to expand Repatha® access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label. Some countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most or all of the sales in that country or region. Failure to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products, a deterioration in their existing coverage and reimbursement, or a decline in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers has negatively affected, and may further negatively affect, the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients and otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we realize for them. Such changes have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. Professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians’ groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, as well as patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies. In addition, a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical products, and even organizations whose guidelines have historically been focused on clinical matters have begun to incorporate analyses of the cost effectiveness of various treatments into their treatment guidelines and recommendations. Value assessments may come from private organizations that publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products’ reimbursement by government and private payers. Some companies and payers have announced pricing and payment decisions based in part on the assessments of private organizations. In addition, government health technology assessment organizations in many countries make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service effects of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Such health technology assessment organizations have recommended, and may in the future recommend, reimbursement for certain of our products for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies or may recommend against reimbursement entirely. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation, and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.38The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax.Our tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business, and a number of audits are currently underway. Tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on the allocations of income and expense among tax jurisdictions. In 2017, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and calculations and have been pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. However, we have been unable to reach resolution at the administrative appeals level, and we anticipate that we will receive a Notice of Deficiency which we would expect to vigorously contest through the judicial process. In addition, in 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. We disagree with the 2013, 2014 and 2015 proposed adjustments and calculations and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. The IRS audit for years 2016, 2017 and 2018 is expected to start in the near term. We are also currently under examination by a number of other state and foreign tax jurisdictions. Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act) is complex and a large volume of regulations and guidance has been issued and could be subject to different interpretations. We could face audit challenges to our application of the 2017 Tax Act. The new Administration and Congress could make changes to existing tax law, including an increase in the corporate tax rate and the tax rate on foreign earnings. Changes to existing tax law in the U.S., the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, or other jurisdictions, including efforts by the OECD to align countries on corporate tax matters that would likely result in tax increases where we do business could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time consuming and distracting, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management’s attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products.39We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the United States and around the world. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar antibribery or anticorruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act. We cannot ensure that all our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. On April 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations relating to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines. As a result, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement, failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and potential exclusion from government healthcare programs. We may also see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. For example, prosecutors are placing greater scrutiny on patient support programs, including commercial copay assistance programs, and further enforcement actions and investigations regarding such programs could limit our ability to provide co-pay assistance to commercial patients. Greater scrutiny has also been placed on sponsorships, speaker programs and other arrangements where healthcare professionals receive remuneration, travel or other value to participate in certain events, and further enforcement actions could limit our ability to participate in such arrangements. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO COMPETITIONOur products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition.We operate in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. We expect that our products and product candidates will compete with existing drugs, new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. With the proliferation of companies pursuing biopharmaceuticals, a number of our product candidates may enter markets with one or more competitors or with competitors soon to arrive. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market. As a result, our products have been competing and may continue to compete, and our product candidates may compete, against products or product candidates that offer higher rebates or discounts, lower prices, equivalent or superior efficacy, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive features. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.40Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Driven by cost pressures, efforts to limit or weaken patent protection for our industry are increasing. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased interest in compulsory licenses, march-in rights or other governmental interventions, both in the United States and internationally, related to the procurement of drugs. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Third parties have challenged and may continue to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentially-infringing product. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, are currently and expect to be in the future, involved in patent litigation. These matters have included, and may in the future include, litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA). A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation has not discouraged, and may not in the future discourage, a potential violator from bringing the allegedly-infringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the losses, damages and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the five-year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the 12-year exclusivity period provided under the BPCIA. In addition, we may face patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies, including those that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products or who are developing or have developed other biosimilar versions of such products. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be delays in ongoing or new patent office or court proceedings in the U.S. or abroad that may delay the outcome of such proceedings. While we have attempted, and expect to continue to attempt, to challenge the patents held by other companies, our efforts may be unsuccessful. Alternatively, such patents have contributed, and may in the future contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all of the same labeled indications as are held by these companies. For examples of and information related to our patent litigation, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Certain of the existing patents on our products have expired. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents. As our patents expire, competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, competitors have been, and may continue to be, able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products.41We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics in most of the territories in which we operate, including Europe and the United States, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar and/or generics competition this year and beyond. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights or expiration of an applicable exclusivity period has accelerated such competition, and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products have also experienced greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive regulatory approval standards and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics, the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate.In the EU, biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some EU countries and some Canadian provinces have adopted or are considering the adoption of biosimilar uptake measures such as physician prescribing quotas or automatic pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. Some EU countries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors. While the degree of competitive effects of biosimilar competition differs between EU countries and between products, in the EU the overall use of biosimilars and the rate at which product sales of innovative products are being affected by biosimilar competition is increasing.In the United States, the BPCIA authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. See Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Approval of Biosimilars. The first biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market was Sandoz’s Zarxio® (filgrastim-sndz), a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®, in 2015. Since then, the FDA has approved additional biosimilars, including biosimilar versions of Neulasta®, EPOGEN® and ENBREL, and a growing number of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products. Four biosimilar versions of Neulasta® are now marketed in the United States, and we expect other biosimilar versions of Neulasta® to receive approval in 2021 and beyond. Impact to our Neulasta® sales has accelerated as additional competitors have launched. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. An approved biosimilar version of EPOGEN® has also launched in the United States, and we are currently involved in patent litigations with the manufacturers of the approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL. Manufacturers of biosimilars have attempted, and may in the future attempt, to compete with our products by offering lower list prices, greater discounts or rebates, or contracts that offer longer-term pricing or a broader portfolio of other products. Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For example, we recently successfully defended our ENBREL patents against a litigation challenge. For examples of and information related to our biosimilars and generics patent litigation, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.The U.S. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to obtain interchangeable status from the FDA, which could potentially allow pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our reference products without prior approval from the prescriber in most states. In November 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance that provides that comparative immunogenicity studies will not generally be expected for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. This may open the door for other product-specific guidance development and the removal of the expectation for certain studies, which may contribute to increased biosimilar competition for our innovative products.In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law’s provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. In late 2019, the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products. Also, the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product’s original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as “umbrella exclusivity”). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period, this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and commercialization, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars and passage of new laws requiring more disclosure in the FDA’s Orange and Purple Books.42Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our small molecule products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. Additionally, if one of our small molecule products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends existing patents for the product by an additional six months. For example, as a result of the product already introduced and/or that could further be introduced into the U.S. market, our product sales for Sensipar® have been adversely affected and could be further materially and adversely affected by competing generics.California is the first state to have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against “pay for delay” settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement agreements are presumptively anticompetitive. The law may result in prolonged litigation and fewer settlements. Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Illinois, and Minnesota, may adopt similar laws or a similar law could be adopted at the federal level.While we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere in 2021 and beyond as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had and could increasingly have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: AmerisourceBergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN®, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and accounts for approximately 90% of all EPOGEN® sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. The three largest PBMs in the United States are now part of major health insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competitive products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. Further, if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor.RISKS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTWe may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&D.Amgen invests heavily in R&D. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&D projects produce commercial products. Product candidates, including biosimilar product candidates, or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:•the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it achieved its primary endpoints and/or demonstrated positive preclinical or early clinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine or expectations of health authorities;•the product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness;•the product candidate was not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics;•the product candidate had harmful side effects in animals or humans;43•the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve the product candidate for an intended use;•the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize;•other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all;•we and certain of our licensees, partners, contracted organizations or independent investigators may have failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; •the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not well-defined;•the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval; and•a companion diagnostic device that is required with the use of a product candidate is not approved by the necessary regulatory authority.We have spent considerable time, energy and resources developing our expertise in human genetics and acquiring access to libraries of genetic information with the belief that genetics could meaningfully aid our search for new medicines and help guide our R&D decisions and investments. We have focused our R&D strategy on drug targets validated by genetic or other compelling human evidence. However, product candidates based on genetically validated targets remain subject to the uncertainties of the drug development process and may not reach the market for a number of reasons, including the factors listed above.A number of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. For example, in 2015, we terminated our participation in the co-development and commercialization of brodalumab, a product candidate that was in phase 3, with AstraZeneca. The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program that occurred late in the development program, which we believed likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population. Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative effect on our product sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development (IPR&D) or other intangible assets.We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.Before we sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels.44Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened, and will continue to open, clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. For other examples of the risks of conducting clinical trials in China, see also Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. Additionally, regional disruptions, including natural and man-made disasters or health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19), could significantly disrupt the timing of clinical trials. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and/or complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, or such sites experience disruptions as a result of a natural/man-made disaster or health emergency, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. For example, our clinical trials have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols, laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In some circumstances, we enter into co-development arrangements with other pharmaceutical and medical devices companies that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trials for the product we are co-developing or to develop a diagnostic test used in screening or monitoring patients in our clinical trials. See Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and of our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products. We also may acquire companies that have past or ongoing clinical trials or rights to products or product candidates for which clinical trials have been or are being conducted. These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or co-development partners, or the independent investigators or vendors selected by us, our co-development partners or by a company we have acquired or from which we have acquired rights to a product or product candidate, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could delay or otherwise negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. In addition, delays or failures to develop diagnostic tests for our clinical trials can affect the timely enrollment of such trials and lead to delays or inability to obtain marketing approval. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.In addition, some of our clinical trials utilize drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products’ or product candidates’ relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively affect the quality of their work product or create a shortage of supply, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively affected. As a result, such quality or supply problems could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide.Clinical trials must generally be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However, in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In some cases, we may design a clinical trial based on the standard of care we anticipate will exist at the time our study is completed. The duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer or that have not become the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. Additionally, the views of regulatory agencies relating to the requirements for accelerated approval may change over time, and trial designs that were sufficient to support accelerated approvals for some oncology products may not be considered sufficient for later candidates. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products and/or maintain our current product labels. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate clinical trial programs and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval.45Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, in connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes, we agreed to and conducted additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense, and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture, market and sell our products. Once our products are approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. The sanctions could include the FDA’s or foreign regulatory authorities’ refusals to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delays or suspensions of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspensions of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecutions.Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals have been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations, change existing laws or regulations or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets, and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets. We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as changes to laws or regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In the United States, a partial federal government shutdown halted the work of many federal agencies and their employees from late December 2018 through late January 2019. A subsequent extended shutdown could result in reductions or delays of FDA’s activities, including with respect to our ongoing clinical programs, our manufacturing of our products and product candidates and our product approvals.Regulatory authorities have questioned, and may in the future question, the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical benefit. For example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce or eliminate minimal residual disease (MRD), or to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening, measured by PFS. Demonstrating that the product candidate induces MRD-negative responses or produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive. In the CV setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDL-C levels, as an elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for CV events such as death, heart attack and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, despite demonstrating that Repatha® reduced LDL-C levels in a broad patient population, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha® to prevent CV events met certain of its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the FDA grant a broader approval of Repatha® to reduce the risk of certain CV events, and also to be used, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce LDL-C. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion, or at all, has delayed, and may in the future delay, our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current product labels.46Some of our products have been approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, in March 2018, we announced that the FDA approved BLINCYTO® under accelerated approval for the treatment of adults and children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second complete remission with MRD greater than or equal to 0.1 percent. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the regulators’ requirements that were conditions of a product’s accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators reevaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the product’s labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market.Regulatory authorities can also impose post-marketing pediatric study requirements. Failure to fulfill such requirements may result in regulatory or enforcement action, including financial penalties or the invalidation of a product’s marketing authorization.Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Postapproval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drug’s benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. The drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions. See Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product’s approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:•revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that has resulted, and may in the future result, in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate;•requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;•post-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;•product recalls of our approved products;•required changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products, which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing;•revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types;•increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or•treatments or product candidates not being approved by regulatory bodies.47For example, after an imbalance in positively adjudicated CV serious adverse events was observed in one of the phase 3 clinical trials for EVENITY® but not in another, larger phase 3 study, in April 2019 the FDA approved EVENITY® for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, along with a post-marketing requirement. The requirement includes a five-year observational feasibility study that could be followed by a comparative safety study or trial.In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. In some markets, there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the BPCIA provided for such a pathway; while the FDA continues to implement it, discussions continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Further, we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the ACA or other legislation or policy initiatives would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure “first-to-market” or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.Many of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. For example, Neulasta® is available as part of the Neulasta® Onpro® kit, and our AutoTouch® reusable autoinjector is used with ENBREL Mini® single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our products or product candidates, including many of our oncology product candidates, including sotorasib, may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. In some regions, including the United States, regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product; in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if development or approval of such devices is delayed, such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance, or if such devices do not remain commercially available. When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies to supply and/or market the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements. Failure to successfully develop, modify, or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products. We are also required to collect and assess user complaints, adverse events and malfunctions regarding our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For example, in 2017, the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it was evaluating our Neulasta® Onpro® kit. Subsequently, we implemented device and labeling enhancements to address product complaints received on this device. We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related approved products.48Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products.We depend on alliances with other companies, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, vendors and service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. For example, we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights, obligations and costs and/or commercial rights and obligations. See Item 1. Business—Business Relationships.Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to us or any disruption in the relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, our collaborative relationships for R&D and/or commercialization and sales often extend for many years and have given, and may in the future give, rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners, including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. For example, we are currently involved in litigation with Novartis over our collaboration agreements for the development and commercialization of Aimovig®. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While our collaboration remains in place until the litigation is resolved and we remain committed to continuing to work with Novartis to sell and deliver Aimovig®, it is possible that the dispute may nevertheless affect the efficiency of operation and future growth of the collaboration. The litigation may also affect or delay, or lead to a termination of, other projects with Novartis.Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions.We seek innovation through significant investment in both internal R&D and external transactions, including collaborations, partnering, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions (collectively, acquisition activity). Acquisition activities may be subject to regulatory approvals or other requirements that are not within our control. There can be no assurance that such regulatory or other approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions required in connection with our acquisition activities will be satisfied or waived, which could result in us being unable to complete the planned acquisition activities.Acquisition activities are complex, time consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may divert our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities and restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits of such transactions within the expected timeframe or at all. We may pay substantial amounts of cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities, which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders, respectively. Further, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses, products or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, manufacturing, distribution and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the benefits of the transaction and grow our business and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. These and other challenges may arise in connection with our recent acquisition of Otezla® and/or collaboration with BeiGene, or with other acquisition activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and stock price.RISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONSWe perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities, in particular those in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks, California. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.49We currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing that supports our product candidates at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Thousand Oaks manufacturing facility could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our product candidates for use in our clinical trials, leading to delays in development of our product candidates.In addition, we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In recent years, Puerto Rico has been affected by natural disasters, including droughts in mid-2020, earthquakes in early 2020 and Hurricane Maria in 2017. These natural disasters have affected, and may continue to affect, public and private properties and Puerto Rico’s electric grid and communications networks in the future. While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters, the restoration of electrical service on the island after Hurricane Maria was a slow process, and our facility operated with electrical power from backup diesel powered generators for some time. We also operated on backup generators for a few weeks after the early 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico. Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase the use of our generators or to continue using them exclusively. In addition, future storms, earthquakes or other natural disasters or events could cause a more significant effect on our manufacturing operations. Puerto Rico and the rest of the world are facing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated health and economic implications. Since March2020, the Governor of Puerto Rico issued Executive Orders requiring the lockdown of businesses and government facilities, imposing restrictions on business operations and a curfew on residents. Our operations and employees have been exempted from the lockdown and curfew, but we cannot predict how long these orders will continue in effect and what impact these orders and the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our future operations, and whether the Governor will issue future Executive Orders imposing stricter lockdown and curfew measures should COVID-19 cases rise in Puerto Rico. Although our ability to manufacture and supply our products has not, to date, been significantly affected by these natural disasters or the COVID-19 pandemic, a combination of these challenges or other issues that could give rise to any substantial disruption to our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.Hurricane Maria, the earthquakes of early 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic have placed greater stress on the island’s already challenged economy. Beginning in 2016, the government of Puerto Rico defaulted on its roughly $72 billion in debt. In response, the U.S. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which established a Financial Oversight and Management Board (Oversight Board) to provide fiscal oversight. Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including a stay of debtholder litigation. In 2017, the Oversight Board approved and certified the filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico of a voluntary petition under Title III of PROMESA for the government of Puerto Rico and certain of its governmental entities, including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which is currently undergoing a privatization process of its transmission and distribution infrastructure. Under PROMESA, other Title III filings for additional government entities may occur, further complicating Puerto Rico’s already uncertain fiscal stability. In June 2019, in response to legal challenges, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of PROMESA and confirmed the constitutionality of the appointment process.Each year since 2017, the Oversight Board has updated Puerto Rico’s fiscal plans imposing significant expense reductions. Each plan has stressed the need for fiscal and structural reforms to address Puerto Rico’s challenging economic and demographic trends. There is pending litigation between the Government of Puerto Rico and the Oversight Board with regards to the Oversight Board’s powers under PROMESA and authority to review and prevent the enforcement of government-approved legislation. This litigation, currently underway in the Title III Court, may impact how and when Puerto Rico will eventually restructure its debt and achieve fiscal and economic stability.While the government and the Oversight Board have authorized emergency relief packages due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is uncertain how, or the degree to which, the pandemic will impact Puerto Rico’s fiscal and structural reforms and its economy. In addition, the 2017 Tax Act no longer permits deferral of U.S. taxation on Puerto Rico earnings, although these earnings generally will be taxed in the United States at a reduced rate. Given Puerto Rico’s challenged economy, disaster recovery needs and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be difficult for Puerto Rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base, which contributes significantly to Puerto Rico’s economy, due to competition from other locations subject to similar levels of taxation.50While PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, Puerto Rico’s ongoing economic and demographic trend challenges and political situation, the effects of natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects of the 2017 Tax Act or other potential tax law changes have negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, the territorial government’s provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business and could create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our products, on our business and on our product sales.We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, Scandinavian Health Limited Group is our single source of SureClick® autoinjectors for Repatha®, ENBREL, Aimovig®, AMGEVITATM and Aranesp®. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin.Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:•regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;•adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;•unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;•failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall;•a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials;•discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components;•cyberattacks on supplier systems; and•labor disputes or shortages, including from the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19) and natural disasters.For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN® glass vials). We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, clinical trial delays, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. These or other similar events could negatively affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.Manufacturing biologic and small molecule human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We manufacture many of our commercial products and product candidates internally. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. See Item 1. Business—Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials—Manufacturing. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products (and product candidates to support our clinical trials) is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be affected by:•capacity of manufacturing facilities;•contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;51•natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;•labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19) or natural disasters;•compliance with regulatory requirements;•changes in forecasts of future demand;•timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields;•updates of manufacturing specifications;•contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers;•timing and outcome of product quality testing;•power failures and/or other utility failures;•cyberattacks on supplier systems;•breakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment (including our information technology systems and network-connected control systems or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers); and/or•delays in the ability of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to provide us necessary reviews, inspections and approvals, including as a result of a subsequent extended U.S. federal or other government shutdowns. If any of these or other problems affect production in one or more of our facilities or those of our third-party contract manufacturers, or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products or the amount of our product candidates required in clinical trials, we may be unable to start or increase production in our unaffected facilities to meet demand. If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. From time to time we have initiated recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, in July 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp® lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot, and in April 2018 we initiated a precautionary recall of two batches of Vectibix® distributed in Switzerland after potential crimping defects were discovered in the metal seals on some product vials. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Our manufacturing processes, those of our third-party contract manufacturers and those of certain of our third-party service providers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license another manufacturing plant, and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer or service provider. If we elect or are required to make changes to our manufacturing processes because of new regulatory requirements, new interpretations of existing requirements or other reasons, this could increase our manufacturing costs and result in delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends or contract negotiations or disputes. Such manufacturing challenges may also occur if our existing contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to timely implement such changes, or at all.52In addition, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspections of our manufacturing facilities and processes as well as those of our third-party contract manufacturers and service providers. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations, they may mandate corrective actions and/or issue warning letters, or even restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, prohibiting us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. See also Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis, or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, contract disputes, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct most of the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air and sea freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which may be negatively affected by natural disasters, security threats and/or the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.There have also been legislative and administrative proposals seeking to incentivize greater drug manufacturing in the United States with the stated goal of improving supply reliability in the United States. For example, on August 6, 2020, the previous Administration issued an Executive Order aimed at boosting domestic production of essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs titled “Executive Order on Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs are Made in the United States.” Additionally, one legislative proposal would prohibit the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from purchasing certain drugs that have active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured outside the United States. While we perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities in the United States, including in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California, the passage of such legislation could result in foreign governments enacting retaliatory legislation or regulatory actions, which may have an adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.GENERAL RISK FACTORSGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. The economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global recession which may be of an extended duration. Additionally, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients’ ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors’, customers’ and suppliers’ financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. A significant worsening of global economic conditions could materially increase these risks facing us.We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The global spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. We have certain assets, including equity investments, that are exposed to market fluctuations that could, in a sustained or recurrent series of market disruptions, result in impairments. The value of our investments may also be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments.53Our stock price is volatile.Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Announcements or discussions, including via social media channels, of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would negatively affect our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. Similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid effect on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially affected.We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. For example, early in 2020, there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper market and several borrowers were unable to obtain funding at normal rates or maturities, which resulted in a significant increase in draws of corporate credit lines with banks. Similarly, the bond markets experienced extreme volatility in terms of interest rates and credit spreads, with several days without new issuances of corporate bonds. We expect to access the capital markets, from time to time, to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we strategically plan to pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.Item 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.54Item 2.PROPERTIESAs of December 31, 2020, we owned or leased approximately 180 properties.

A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world’s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. In 2020, we celebrated our 40th anniversary, continuing our history of focusing on innovative medicines that have the potential to be first-in-class molecules and that have a large-effect size on serious diseases.Our principal products—those with the most significant annual commercial sales—are ENBREL, Prolia®, Neulasta®, Otezla®, XGEVA®, Aranesp®, KYPROLIS® and Repatha®. We also market a number of other products, including Nplate®, Vectibix®, MVASI®, Parsabiv®, EPOGEN®, KANJINTI®, BLINCYTO®, Aimovig®, EVENITY®, AMGEVITATM, Sensipar®/Mimpara®, NEUPOGEN®, IMLYGIC®, Corlanor® and AVSOLA®. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.Our strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry. We focus on six commercial areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology, bone health, CV disease, nephrology and neuroscience, and we conduct discovery research primarily in three therapeutic areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology and CV/metabolic diseases. In 2020, we advanced our innovative pipeline, successfully integrated Otezla®, acquired in November 2019, into our inflammation portfolio, advanced our international expansion and continued to provide uninterrupted supply of our medicines globally through the COVID-19 pandemic. We accomplished these objectives while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation, and advancing our environmental, social and governance efforts. During the year, while meeting the challenges of a global pandemic and facing increased competition from biosimilars and generics, total product sales increased 9%, driven by volume growth primarily from Otezla®, partially offset by lower net selling prices. Product sales increased 9% and 10% in the United States and rest of the world, respectively. Total operating expenses increased 19%, driven by expenses related to Otezla®.We continued to advance our pipeline, including sotorasib and tezepelumab—two molecules with respect to which we have achieved positive registration enabling data from our clinical trial activities. We also continued to advance our biosimilar program with the launch of AVSOLA® and the approval of RIABNITM in the United States. Our biosimilars are expected to launch in new markets throughout 2021. Lastly, we broadened our international reach, particularly in the Asia Pacific region with our investment in and strategic collaboration with BeiGene to expand our oncology presence in China, as well as the establishment of our wholly owned affiliate in Japan.Cash flows from operating activities totaled $10.5 billion, enabling us to invest in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. For 2020, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.60 per share of common stock. In December 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $1.76 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2021. We also repurchased 15.2 million shares of our common stock throughout 2020, at an aggregate cost of $3.5 billion. During the year, we had proceeds from the issuance of debt of $8.9 billion and repayments of debt of $6.5 billion. In addition, we exchanged some of our higher interest rate debt for newly issued debt with a lower interest rate and a later maturity date.Amgen’s approach to, and investment in, human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating and retaining talent to tackle the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative medicines. Our compensation, benefits and development programs are designed to encourage performance, promote accountability and adherence to Company values, and in alignment with the interests of the Company’s shareholders. Further, we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation, which supports our ability to serve patients. We also believe our global presence is strengthened by having a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients we serve. It is with these beliefs in mind that we have continued to strengthen and grow our culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging. Our internal efforts include, in 2019, establishing a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Council. We are engaging in activities and setting goals to improve our focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging. For further information on these and other efforts, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Human Capital Resources.60We have a long-standing ambition to be environmentally responsible, and we regularly set targets to challenge ourselves to deliver further improvements. In 2020, we met or exceeded our environmental sustainability targets set out in 2013 that called for reducing fleet carbon output by up to 20%, facility carbon output by 10%, water consumption by 10% and waste disposal by 35%2. We achieved our 2020 targets while growing revenues, increasing production capacity, and expanding to more than 100 countries over the same 2013 to 2020 period. To continue on our path to greater environmental sustainability, in January 2021 we announced a new set of long-term environmental targets to achieve by 2027, including achieving carbon neutrality, reducing water consumption by 40% and reducing waste disposed by 75%.Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. Certain of our products face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents, and Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities, but successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We also face increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.Rising healthcare costs and uncertain economic conditions continue to pose challenges to our business, including increasing pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public and private healthcare-provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain factors that could impact our future product sales.COVID-19 pandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a moderate impact to our business in 2020. Since the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, we have been carefully monitoring its impact on our global operations. We have taken appropriate steps to minimize the risk to our employees. A significant number of our employees have been working remotely, with the exception of certain staff that require access to our manufacturing and laboratory research facilities, in accordance with applicable government health and safety protocols and guidance issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, our remote working arrangements have not significantly affected our ability to maintain critical business operations, and we have not experienced disruptions or shortages of our supply of medicines.Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen changes in demand trends for some of our products, including lower demand for certain products as continuing patient access to those products has been affected by COVID-19, particularly in the early phases of the pandemic. For example, near the end of March, we began to observe a decline in sales of Prolia®, as elderly patients, who are relatively more vulnerable to COVID-19, avoided doctors’ offices. Demand has since recovered to varying degrees by product as local conditions improved in certain geographies that opened after an initial improvement in COVID-19 infection rates, allowing patients to resume receiving their treatments. During the second half of the year, our own efforts remain focused on assisting patients with improving their continuity of care to increase product access as compared to what they experienced during the earlier stages of the pandemic. Recently, higher rates of infection have been observed in certain geographies, including the United States and Europe, which may further restrict demand, similar to early phases of the pandemic. As a result, we expect to see continued volatility through at least the duration of the pandemic as governments respond to current local conditions.2 Represents reductions against established baselines, taking into account only verified reduction projects, and does not take into account changes associated with contraction or expansion of the company.61The majority of clinical trials that were paused at the onset of the pandemic to ensure subject safety or data integrity have resumed. Study enrollment was affected negatively the most in the second quarter of the year and by the end of 2020 resumed to around pre-pandemic levels. However, going forward COVID-19 infection rates and related vaccination activities may impact future study enrollment. We continuously monitor our ability for study enrollment on an institution by institution basis and reevaluate the status of studies, pausing when uncertainty arises with regard to the trial sites’ ability to ensure safety or data integrity. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in providing care for these patients and in providing investigational drug supply. In addition, our R&D organization is supporting efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in a number of ways, including by (i) working to support production of therapeutic antibodies that could diminish the impact of COVID-19 on patients, (ii) joining a public–private partnership between leading companies in our industry and U.S. government health agencies to develop a strategy for a coordinated research response and (iii) participating in platform studies to investigate treatments in adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infections.We continue to believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements as well as to engage in the capital-return and other business initiatives that we plan to strategically pursue. For a discussion of the risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic to our results, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.62Selected Financial InformationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data):Year ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019Product sales:U.S.$17,985 9 %$16,531 Rest-of-world (ROW)6,255 10 %5,673 Total product sales24,240 9 %22,204 Other revenues1,184 2 %1,158 Total revenues$25,424 9 %$23,362 Operating expenses$16,285 19 %$13,688 Operating income$9,139 (6)%$9,674 Net income$7,264 (7)%$7,842 Diluted EPS$12.31 (4)%$12.88 Diluted shares590 (3)%609 In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers (such as physicians or their clinics), dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held by wholesaler customers and end users (such as pharmacies).Total product sales increased for 2020, primarily driven by unit demand increases from newer brands including Otezla®, acquired in November 2019, MVASI®, KANJINTI® and Repatha®. These unit demand increases were partially offset by declines in net selling prices for certain products, unit demand declines for mature brands that face biosimilar or generic competition and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2021, we expect that net selling prices will continue to decline. We also expect increasing competition against our biosimilar products. Further, the first quarter historically represents the lowest product sales quarter for the year, in part, due to plan changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, particularly for our pharmacy benefit products.During the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced changes in demand trends for some of our products. The pandemic interrupted many physician–patient interactions, which led to delays in diagnosis and treatment, with varying degrees of impact across our portfolio. In general, sales of negatively affected products fell the most in the early part of the second quarter, with product demand beginning to show some recovery in the second half of the year but still below pre-pandemic levels. Nevertheless, given the increased intensity exiting 2020 and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, we expect there could be intermittent disruptions in physician–patient interactions going forward, and thus we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variability. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.In addition, other changes in the healthcare ecosystem introduce variability into product sales trends. For example, changes in U.S. employment could lead to changes to the insured population, with growth in Medicaid enrollees and uninsured individuals having a negative impact on revenues. Overall, uncertainty has increased around the timing and magnitude of our sales during the COVID-19 pandemic.Other revenues increased for 2020, primarily driven by higher royalties.Operating expenses increased for 2020, primarily driven by acquisition- and commercial-related expenses for Otezla®.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2020, 2019 or 2018.63Results of OperationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019ChangeYear ended December 31, 2018ENBREL$4,996 (4)%$5,226 4 %$5,014 Prolia®2,763 3 %2,672 17 %2,291 Neulasta®2,293 (29)%3,221 (28)%4,475 Otezla®2,195 *178 N/A— XGEVA®1,899 (2)%1,935 8 %1,786 Aranesp®1,568 (9)%1,729 (8)%1,877 KYPROLIS®1,065 2 %1,044 8 %968 Repatha®887 34 %661 20 %550 Other products6,574 19 %5,538 (1)%5,572 Total product sales$24,240 9 %$22,204 (1)%$22,533 Total U.S.$17,985 9 %$16,531 (5)%$17,429 Total ROW6,255 10 %5,673 11 %5,104 Total product sales$24,240 9 %$22,204 (1)%$22,533 * Change in excess of 100%.Future sales of our products will depend in part on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1.

In addition, for a list of our products’ significant competitors, see Part I, Item 1.

Consistent with prior periods, ENBREL has continued to lose market share, and this decline has been compounded by a reduction in the growth rate of the rheumatology market as a result of COVID-19. For 2021, we expect ENBREL to follow the historic pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increase co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles. In addition, for 2021, we expect volume and net selling price declines to continue.The increase in ENBREL sales for 2019 was primarily driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and an increase in net selling price, partially offset by lower unit demand.In April 2019, the FDA approved a second biosimilar version of ENBREL, and we are involved in patent litigations with the two companies seeking to market their FDA-approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Companies with approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL may seek to enter the U.S. market if we are not successful in our litigations, or even earlier. Other companies are also developing proposed biosimilar versions of ENBREL.64Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019ChangeYear ended December 31, 2018Prolia® — U.S.$1,830 3 %$1,772 18 %$1,500 Prolia® — ROW933 4 %900 14 %791 Total Prolia®$2,763 3 %$2,672 17 %$2,291 Disruptions in patient visits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic affected demand during 2020 by altering the timing of patients receiving their semiannual doses and by lowering the diagnosis of osteoporosis in new patients. This deceleration of demand has softened the historical growth rates and altered demand patterns of Prolia® experienced in years prior to the pandemic. For 2021, historical demand patterns may continue to be impacted by the pandemic.The increase in global Prolia® sales for 2020 was driven by higher unit demand and net selling price.The increase in global Prolia® sales for 2019 was driven by higher unit demand.Neulasta®Total Neulasta® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019ChangeYear ended December 31, 2018Neulasta® — U.S.$2,001 (29)%$2,814 (27)%$3,866 Neulasta® — ROW292 (28)%407 (33)%609 Total Neulasta®$2,293 (29)%$3,221 (28)%$4,475 The decreases in global Neulasta® sales for 2020 and 2019 were driven by the impact of biosimilar competition on net selling price and unit demand. Neulasta® sales included a $98 million order from the U.S. government in the first quarter of 2019.We have increased competition in the United States and Europe as a result of biosimilar versions of Neulasta®, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales. We also expect other biosimilar versions to be approved in the future. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigations related to these and other biosimilars, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Otezla®Total Otezla® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019ChangeYear ended December 31, 2018Otezla® — U.S.$1,790 *$139 N/A$— Otezla® — ROW405 *39 N/A— Total Otezla®$2,195 *$178 N/A$— * Change in excess of 100%.Otezla® was acquired on November 21, 2019, and generated $2.2 billion and $178 million in global sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For 2021, we expect Otezla® to follow the historic pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increase co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles. For a discussion of ongoing litigation related to Otezla®, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.65XGEVA®Total XGEVA® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019ChangeYear ended December 31, 2018XGEVA® — U.S.$1,405 (4)%$1,457 9 %$1,338 XGEVA® — ROW494 3 %478 7 %448 Total XGEVA®$1,899 (2)%$1,935 8 %$1,786 The decrease in global XGEVA® sales for 2020 was driven by lower unit demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increase in global XGEVA® sales for 2019 was primarily driven by higher unit demand.Aranesp®Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019ChangeYear ended December 31, 2018Aranesp® — U.S.$629 (17)%$758 (20)%$942 Aranesp® — ROW939 (3)%971 4 %935 Total Aranesp®$1,568 (9)%$1,729 (8)%$1,877 The decrease in global Aranesp® sales for 2020 was driven by declines in net selling price and unit demand.The decrease in global Aranesp® sales for 2019 was primarily driven by the impact of competition on unit demand in the United States.Aranesp® faces competition from a long-acting ESA. Aranesp® also faces competition from a biosimilar version of EPOGEN®. For 2021, we expect that sales will continue to decline due to short- and long-acting competition.KYPROLIS®Total KYPROLIS® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019ChangeYear ended December 31, 2018KYPROLIS® — U.S.$710 9 %$654 12 %$583 KYPROLIS® — ROW355 (9)%390 1 %385 Total KYPROLIS®$1,065 2 %$1,044 8 %$968 The increase in global KYPROLIS® sales for 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in net selling price and favorable changes in inventory, partially offset by lower unit demand.The increase in global KYPROLIS® sales for 2019 was primarily driven by higher unit demand. We are engaged in litigation with two companies that are challenging certain of our patents related to KYPROLIS® and that are seeking to market generic carfilzomib products. Separately, we have entered into confidential settlement agreements with other companies developing generic carfilzomib products, and the court has entered consent judgments enjoining those companies from infringing certain of our patents, subject to terms of the confidential settlement agreements. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The FDA reported that it has granted tentative or final approval to Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for generic carfilzomib products filed by a number of companies for generic carfilzomib products. The date of approval of those ANDAs for generic carfilzomib products is governed by the Hatch-Waxman Act and any applicable settlement agreements between the parties.66Repatha®Total Repatha® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019ChangeYear ended December 31, 2018Repatha® — U.S.$459 22 %$376 5 %$358 Repatha® — ROW428 50 %285 48 %192 Total Repatha®$887 34 %$661 20 %$550 The increases in global Repatha® sales for 2020 and 2019 were driven by higher unit demand, partially offset by lower net selling price. The decrease to the Repatha® net selling price in 2020 was the result of contracting changes to improve Medicare Part D patient access.For a discussion of ongoing litigation related to Repatha®, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019ChangeYear ended December 31, 2018Nplate® — U.S.$485 1 %$480 10 %$438 Nplate® — ROW365 16 %315 13 %279 Vectibix® — U.S.342 8 %316 10 %288 Vectibix® — ROW469 10 %428 6 %403 MVASI® — U.S.656 *121 N/A— MVASI® — ROW142 *6 N/A— Parsabiv® — U.S.605 10 %550 82 %302 Parsabiv® — ROW111 39 %80 *34 EPOGEN® — U.S.598 (31)%867 (14)%1,010 KANJINTI® — U.S.475 *118 N/A— KANJINTI® — ROW92 (15)%108 *44 BLINCYTO® — U.S.231 31 %176 31 %134 BLINCYTO® — ROW148 9 %136 42 %96 Aimovig® — U.S.378 24 %306 *119 EVENITY® — U.S.191 *42 N/A— EVENITY® — ROW159 8 %147 N/A— AMGEVITATM — ROW331 54 %215 *11 Sensipar® — U.S.92 (63)%252 (82)%1,436 Sensipar®/Mimpara® — ROW196 (34)%299 (12)%338 NEUPOGEN® — U.S.144 (19)%178 (20)%223 NEUPOGEN® — ROW81 (6)%86 (39)%142 Other — U.S.109 4 %105 24 %85 Other — ROW174 (16)%207 9 %190 Total other product sales$6,574 19 %$5,538 (1)%$5,572 Total U.S. — other products$4,306 23 %$3,511 (13)%$4,035 Total ROW — other products2,268 12 %2,027 32 %1,537 Total other product sales$6,574 19 %$5,538 (1)%$5,572 * Change in excess of 100%.67Operating expensesOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019ChangeYear ended December 31, 2018Operating expenses:Cost of sales$6,159 41 %$4,356 6 %$4,101 % of product sales25.4 %19.6 %18.2 %% of total revenues24.2 %18.6 %17.3 %Research and development$4,207 2 %$4,116 10 %$3,737 % of product sales17.4 %18.5 %16.6 %% of total revenues16.5 %17.6 %15.7 %Selling, general and administrative$5,730 11 %$5,150 (3)%$5,332 % of product sales23.6 %23.2 %23.7 %% of total revenues22.5 %22.0 %22.5 %Other$189 *$66 (79)%$314 * Change in excess of 100%.Cost of salesCost of sales increased to 24.2% of total revenues for 2020, primarily driven by the amortization of expenses related to our acquisition of Otezla®, and higher royalty expenses and profit share, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs.Cost of sales increased to 18.6% of total revenues for 2019, primarily driven by unfavorable product mix and amortization of intangible assets as a result of our acquisition of Otezla®, partially offset by lower royalties and lower manufacturing costs.Research and developmentThe Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (i) research and early pipeline, (ii) later-stage clinical programs and (iii) marketed products. These categories are described below:CategoryDescriptionResearch and early pipeline R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process developmentLater-stage clinical programsR&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product primarily in the United States or the EUMarketed productsR&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold primarily in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtainedR&D expense by category was as follows (in millions):Years ended December 31,202020192018Research and early pipeline$1,405 $1,649 $1,201 Later-stage clinical programs1,365 1,062 1,034 Marketed products1,437 1,405 1,502 Total R&D expense$4,207 $4,116 $3,737 68The increase in R&D expense for 2020 was driven by higher spend for later-stage clinical programs, including sotorasib, biosimilar programs and Otezla®, and higher spend for Otezla® included in marketed-product support. These increases were partially offset by recoveries from our collaboration with BeiGene that reduced expenses in later-stage clinical programs and in research and early pipeline, and lower spend in certain oncology programs included in research and early pipeline.The increase in R&D expense for 2019 was primarily driven by higher spend in research and early pipeline in support of our oncology programs, partially offset by lower marketed-product support.Selling, general and administrativeThe increase in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense for 2020 was driven by investments in certain marketed products, primarily Otezla®, and preparation for product launches, partially offset by a reduction in conference-related expenses due to the impact of COVID-19.The decrease in SG&A expense for 2019 was primarily driven by lower general and administrative expenses, the end of certain amortization charges in 2018 and lower spend for launched and marketed products, partially offset by spending for Otezla® commercial-related expenses.OtherOther operating expenses for 2020 primarily consisted of legal settlement expenses.Other operating expenses for 2019 included $47 million in restructuring costs.Other operating expenses for 2018 included a $330 million impairment charge associated with an IPR&D asset and a $42 million favorable net change in the fair values of contingent consideration liabilities. See Part IV—Note 17, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Nonoperating expenses/income and income taxesNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Years ended December 31,202020192018Interest expense, net$1,262 $1,289 $1,392 Interest and other income, net$256 $753 $674 Provision for income taxes$869 $1,296 $1,151 Effective tax rate10.7 %14.2 %12.1 %Interest expense, netThe decrease in Interest expense, net, for 2020 was primarily due to lower LIBOR rates on debt for which we effectively pay a variable rate of interest, partially offset by net costs associated with the early retirement of debt.The decrease in Interest expense, net, for 2019 was primarily due to a reduction in outstanding long-term debt as a result of maturities in 2019.Interest and other income, netThe decrease in Interest and other income, net, for 2020 was primarily due to reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash balances and a decline in interest yields and losses incurred in connection with our BeiGene investment, partially offset by gains recognized on our investments in publicly traded equity securities and limited partnerships. We may continue to recognize losses in connection with our BeiGene investment in 2021. See Part IV—Note 9, Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The increase in Interest and other income, net, for 2019 was primarily due to net gains on sales of investments in interest-bearing securities liquidated to fund our acquisition of Otezla® and our investment in BeiGene compared with losses in the prior year, partially offset by reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash balances and a gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (K-A), in the first quarter of 2018. See Part IV—Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.69Income taxesThe decrease in our effective tax rate for 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily driven by favorable items, including audit settlements, adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, lower interest expense on uncertain tax positions and amortization related to the Otezla® acquisition, partially offset by changes in valuation allowance.The increase in our effective tax rate for 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily driven by a prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reform.In March and December 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, were passed into law and provide additional economic stimulus to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not expect any significant benefit to our income tax provision as a result of this legislation.In 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and calculations and have been pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. However, we have been unable to reach resolution at the administrative appeals level, and we anticipate that we will receive a Notice of Deficiency which we would expect to vigorously contest through the judicial process. In addition, in 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. We disagree with the 2013, 2014 and 2015 proposed adjustments and calculations and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. The IRS audit for years 2016, 2017 and 2018 is expected to start in the near term. We are also currently under examination by a number of other state and foreign tax jurisdictions. Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies—Income taxes, and Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions):December 31,20202019Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$10,647 $8,911 Total assets$62,948 $59,707 Current portion of long-term debt$91 $2,953 Long-term debt$32,895 $26,950 Stockholders’ equity$9,409 $9,673 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesWe have global access to our $10.6 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Capital allocationConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we deploy our accumulated cash balances in a strategic manner and consider a number of alternatives, including strategic transactions (including those that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest), repayment of debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. 70We intend to continue to invest in our business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases, thereby reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company’s agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by our overall level of cash, stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.60, $1.45 and $1.32 per share of common stock paid in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of 10% over the prior year in both 2020 and 2019. In December 2020, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.76 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2021.We also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2020, we repurchased $3.5 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $3.5 billion. In 2019, we repurchased $7.6 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $7.7 billion. In 2018, we repurchased $17.9 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $17.8 billion, which included 52.1 million shares of common stock repurchased through a $10.0 billion tender offer. In May 2019 and December 2019, our Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, $3.0 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.As a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our accumulated deficit is not anticipated to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our expected continued profitability and strong financial position.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Financing arrangementsThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2020, were $0.1 billion and $32.9 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2019, were $3.0 billion and $27.0 billion, respectively. The carrying values of our long-term borrowings are net of fair value adjustments for interest rate swaps and unamortized discounts, premiums and offering costs. As of December 31, 2020, Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch), assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A– with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB+ with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings.During 2020, we issued debt with an aggregate principal amount of $9.0 billion. During 2019 and 2018, we did not issue any debt or debt securities. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we repaid debt of $6.5 billion, $4.5 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. In addition, during 2020, we exchanged $0.7 billion of certain of our outstanding note issuances with $0.9 billion of newly issued notes with a lower interest rate and later maturity date.To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the lives of the respective notes. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.9 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively.To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion.71As of December 31, 2020, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.In 2019, we amended and restated our $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement, which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $750 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest for any amounts borrowed under this facility, based on our current credit rating, at (i) LIBOR plus 1% or (ii) the highest of (A) the syndication agent bank base commercial lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1%. The agreement contains provisions related to the determination of successor rates to address the possible phase-out or unavailability of designated reference rates. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.It is anticipated that LIBOR will be phased out and replaced by 2023. While various replacement reference rates have been discussed, an alternative reference rate to LIBOR has not yet been widely adopted. Therefore, the mechanics to modify existing contracts that reference LIBOR have not been finalized. We are currently evaluating the impact that the change in the reference rate will have on our financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.In February 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2023.Certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2020. See Part IV—Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash flowsOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions):Years ended December 31,202020192018Net cash provided by operating activities$10,497 $9,150 $11,296 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities$(5,401)$5,709 $14,339 Net cash used in financing activities$(4,867)$(15,767)$(22,490)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2020 primarily due to higher Net income after adding back the noncash amortization related to the acquisition of Otezla®, the monetization of interest rate swap contracts and working capital adjustments. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2019 primarily due to changes in working capital, an increase in payments to the IRS related to an advance deposit and lower Net income.72InvestingCash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily due to our $3.2 billion of purchases of equity method investments, primarily BeiGene, and net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $1.5 billion. Cash provided by investing activities during 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $20.0 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively. The liquidation of portions of our marketable securities portfolio in 2019 was primarily the result of funding the acquisition of Otezla® and our investment in BeiGene and, in 2018, to fund our tender offer to repurchase our common stock. Capital expenditures were $608 million, $618 million and $738 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We currently estimate 2021 spending on capital projects to be approximately $900 million. A majority of the increase in expenditures relates to expansion of manufacturing capacity to enable supply of products and product candidates.FinancingCash used in financing activities during 2020 was primarily due to repayments of debt of $6.5 billion, the payment of dividends of $3.8 billion and payments to repurchase our common stock of $3.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of debt of $8.9 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2019 was primarily due to repurchases of our common stock of $7.7 billion, repayments of debt of $4.5 billion and payments of dividends of $3.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2018 was primarily due to repurchases of common stock of $17.8 billion, payments of dividends of $3.5 billion and repayments of debt of $1.1 billion. See Part IV—Note 9, Investments, Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 16, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.73Contractual ObligationsContractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period as of December 31, 2020Contractual obligationsTotalYear 1Years 2 and 3Years 4 and 5Years 6 and beyondLong-term debt obligations(1)(2)$54,293 $1,207 $7,857 $4,944 $40,285 Operating lease obligations(3)864 166 268 102 328 Purchase obligations(4)2,697 2,129 375 121 72 U.S. repatriation tax(5)5,575 587 1,687 3,301 — Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs)(6)— — — — — Total contractual obligations$63,429 $4,089 $10,187 $8,468 $40,685 (1)Long-term debt obligations includes future interest payments on our fixed-rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the terms of the related hedge contracts. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2020, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts, which resulted in an aggregate net decrease in future interest payments of $67 million. See Part IV—Note 15, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Long-term debt obligations includes contractual interest payments and principal repayments of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively converted interest payments and principal repayments on this debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IV—Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(3)Operating lease obligations includes payments for leases that have not yet commenced, net of lease incentives, and excludes $107 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities.(4)Purchase obligations relates primarily to (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.(5)Under the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay in eight annual installments the repatriation tax related primarily to our prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments—Commitments–U.S. repatriation tax, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(6)Liabilities for UTBs are not included in the table above because due to their nature there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. See Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts that in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of K-A and BioVex Group Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $5.4 billion, including $250 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex.74Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.Product sales and sales deductionsRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions):RebatesChargebacksOther deductionsTotalBalance as of December 31, 2017$1,867 $272 $108 $2,247 Amounts charged against product sales6,180 6,926 1,180 14,286 Payments(5,458)(6,744)(1,161)(13,363)Balance as of December 31, 20182,589 454 127 3,170 Amounts charged against product sales6,825 7,090 1,292 15,207 Payments(6,249)(6,985)(1,263)(14,497)Balance as of December 31, 20193,165 559 156 3,880 Amounts charged against product sales9,167 8,223 1,818 19,208 Payments(8,353)(8,191)(1,735)(18,279)Balance as of December 31, 2020$3,979 $591 $239 $4,809 For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, total sales deductions were 44%, 41% and 39% of gross product sales, respectively. The increase in the total sales deductions balance as of December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by the increase in gross sales and the impact of higher U.S. commercial rebate rates. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold.Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements that vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels; and we accrue these rebates in the period the related sales are recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. 75Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results because chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.Product returnsReturns are estimated by comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.Income taxesWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.Certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements, and they cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.We are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax in the jurisdictions where we conduct operations based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035.As previously disclosed, in 2017 we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and calculations and have been pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. However, we have been unable to reach resolution at the administrative appeals level, and we anticipate that we will receive a Notice of Deficiency which we would expect to vigorously contest through the judicial process. In addition, in 2020 we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. We disagree with the 2013, 2014 and 2015 proposed adjustments and calculations and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. The IRS audit for years 2016, 2017 and 2018 is expected to start in the near term. We are also currently under examination by a number of other state and foreign tax jurisdictions. Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based 76on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes and class action suits that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitionsWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in an acquisition. See Part IV—Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to:•determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;•projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;•estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and•developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.Impairment of long-lived assetsWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value.We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.77Impairment of equity method investmentsWe review the carrying value of our equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an investment may not be recoverable. We record impairment losses on our equity method investments if we deem the impairment to be other-than-temporary. We deem an impairment to be other-than-temporary based on various factors, including but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value is below the carrying value, volatility of the security price, the financial condition of the issuer, changes in technology that may impair the earnings potential of the investment and our intent and ability to retain the investment to allow for a recovery in fair value. We believe our judgments used in assessing impairment of equity method investments are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Part IV—Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2020.Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Except as noted below, we have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.Interest-rate-sensitive financial instrumentsOur portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, was composed of U.S. Treasury securities and money market mutual funds, and with respect to investments as of December 31, 2019, corporate debt securities and other short-term interest-bearing securities. The fair values of our available-for-sale investments were $9.8 billion and $8.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, would not have resulted in a material reduction in the fair values of these securities. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year.As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.0 billion and a fair value of $39.4 billion. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $29.9 billion and a fair value of $33.7 billion. Our outstanding debt was composed almost entirely of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, would have resulted in increases of $4.5 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. Analysis of the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below.To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective notes. Interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.9 billion and $9.6 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $230 million and $380 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates. Analysis of the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest-rate-sensitive instruments were designed to offset. 78As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion that hedge our foreign-currency-denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $250 million and $280 million, respectively.Foreign-currency-sensitive financial instrumentsOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $4.8 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $4.5 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.1 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.0 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2019, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.0 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $900 million. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the related foreign-currency-denominated debt.We have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these contracts of $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion on these dates, respectively. The impact of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates on ensuing years’ income from these contracts would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2020, the fair values of these contracts were a $28 million asset and a $237 million liability. As of December 31, 2019, the fair values of these contracts were a $223 million asset and a $31 million liability. As of December 31, 2020, we had primarily euro based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.1 billion. As of December 31, 2019, we had primarily euro based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.0 billion. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open as of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $1.1 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $420 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2019, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $930 million on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $400 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had open short-duration foreign currency forward contracts that mature in less than one month, with notional amounts of $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, a hypothetical 5% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.79Market-price-sensitive financial instrumentsAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small-capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, was not material.Counterparty credit risksOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk, which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring that transactions be made only with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A– or equivalent by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch; and it places exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.",2023-12-30 18:04:48.831573

For a discussion of the risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic to our results, see Risk Factors in Item 1A.2Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsThe largest concentration of our sales and marketing forces is based in the United States and Europe. In recent years, we have expanded the commercialization and marketing of our products into other geographic territories, including China and Japan and other parts of Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. This expansion has occurred, and is expected to continue to occur, by establishing our own affiliates, by acquiring existing third-party businesses or product rights or by collaborating with third parties. See Business Relationships for our significant alliances. Whether we use our own sales and marketing forces or a third party’s services varies across these markets. Such use typically depends on several factors, including the nature of entry into the new market, the size of an opportunity and operational capabilities. Together with our collaborators, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.In the United States, substantially all of our sales are to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, which are the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. We also market certain products through direct-to-consumer channels, including print, television and online media. For further discussion, see Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. Outside the United States, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country. In the Asia Pacific region, we also sell our products in partnership with other companies, including BeiGene, Daiichi Sankyo, KKC and Takeda.Our product sales to three large wholesalers, McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., each individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years 2021, 2020 and 2019. On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for 82%, 83% and 81% of worldwide gross revenues for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, in certain circumstances, by requiring letters of credit or obtaining credit insurance.3Our products are marketed around the world, with the United States as our largest market.

ENBREL was launched in 1998 and is used primarily in indications for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and patients with active psoriatic arthritis.ProliaWe market Prolia in many countries around the world. Prolia contains the same active ingredient as XGEVA but is approved for different indications, patient populations, doses and frequencies of administration. Prolia was launched in the United States and Europe in 2010. In the United States, it is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or in patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In Europe, Prolia is used primarily for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture.OtezlaWe market Otezla, a small molecule that inhibits PDE4, in many countries around the world. Otezla was acquired from BMS in November 2019 after their acquisition of Celgene. Otezla is an oral therapy approved for the treatment of adult patients with plaque psoriasis across all severities for whom phototherapy or systemic therapy is appropriate, patients with active psoriatic arthritis and patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet’s disease. In Europe, Otezla is approved for second-line use in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis and for patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet’s disease who are candidates for systemic therapy. XGEVAWe market XGEVA in many countries around the world. XGEVA was launched in 2010 and is used primarily in the indication for prevention of SREs (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or surgery to bone) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors and multiple myeloma.NeulastaWe market Neulasta, a pegylated protein based on the filgrastim molecule, primarily in the United States and Europe. Neulasta was launched in 2002 and is used primarily in the indication to help reduce the chance of infection due to a low white blood cell count in patients with certain types of cancer (nonmyeloid) who receive anticancer medicines (chemotherapy) that can cause fever and a low blood cell count. In 2015, the Neulasta Onpro kit became available in the United States. The Neulasta Onpro kit provides physicians the opportunity to initiate administration of Neulasta on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery of the recommended dose of Neulasta at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving the patient a trip back to the doctor.AranespWe market Aranesp primarily in the United States and Europe. It was launched in 2001 and is indicated to treat a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells (anemia) caused by CKD in both patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. Aranesp is also indicated for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy in certain patients with nonmyeloid malignancies and when chemotherapy will be used for at least two months after starting Aranesp.RepathaWe market Repatha, a PCSK9 inhibitor, in many countries around the world. Repatha was launched in 2015 and is indicated to reduce the risks of myocardial infarction, stroke and coronary revascularization in adults with established CV disease. Repatha is also indicated to reduce LDL-C in adults with primary hyperlipidemia, including HeFH; in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with HeFH; and in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with HoFH.KYPROLISWe market KYPROLIS primarily in the United States and Europe. KYPROLIS was launched in 2012 and is indicated in combination with (i) dexamethasone, (ii) lenalidomide plus dexamethasone and (iii) DARZALEX plus dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. It is also approved as a single agent for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more previous therapies.5NplateWe market Nplate in many countries around the world. Nplate was launched in 2008 and is indicated to treat thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic ITP who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins or splenectomy.Other Marketed ProductsWe also market a number of other products in various markets worldwide, including MVASI, Vectibix, KANJINTI, EVENITY, EPOGEN, BLINCYTO, AMGEVITA, Aimovig, Parsabiv, NEUPOGEN, LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, Sensipar/Mimpara, AVSOLA, RIABNI and TEZSPIRE.

We disagree with the court’s holding and we are in the process of appealing this judgment. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Amgen Inc. vs. Sandoz Inc., et al.(3)A patent with this subject matter may be entitled to patent term extension in the United States.7CompetitionWe operate in a highly competitive environment. A number of our marketed products are indicated for disease areas in which other products or treatments are currently available or are being pursued by our competitors through R&D activities. Additionally, some competitor-marketed products target the same genetic pathways as our recently launched marketed products or are currently in development. This competition could impact the pricing and market share of our products. We continue to pursue ways of increasing the value of our medicines through innovations during their life cycles, which can include expanding the disease areas for which our products are indicated and finding new methods to make the delivery of our medicines easier and less costly. Such activities can offer important opportunities for differentiation. For example, we market the Neulasta Onpro kit, which provides physicians the opportunity to initiate administration of the recommended dose of Neulasta on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving the patient a trip back to the doctor. We plan to continue pursuing innovation efforts to strengthen our competitive position. Such position may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience, delivery devices, price, reimbursement, access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration.Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have expired, and we face new and increasing competition, including from biosimilars and generics. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is “highly similar” to the original reference product. We have experienced adverse effects from biosimilar competition on our originator product sales. Companies have launched biosimilar versions of EPOGEN, NEUPOGEN and Neulasta and have approved biosimilars for ENBREL. Once multiple biosimilar versions of one of our originator products have launched, competition has intensified rapidly, resulting in greater net price declines for both reference and biosimilar products, and a greater effect on product sales. See also Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Approval of Biosimilars. Although competitor biosimilars compete on price, we believe many patients, providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation, supply reliability and safety of our products. As additional biosimilar competitors come to market, we will continue to leverage our global experience to distinguish against both branded and biosimilar competition.We also have our own biosimilar products both in the United States and outside of U.S. markets that are competing against branded and biosimilar versions of our competitors’ products. In 2019, Amgen launched MVASI, a biosimilar to Avastin, and KANJINTI, a biosimilar to Herceptin; and in 2018, Amgen launched AMGEVITA, a biosimilar to Humira in ex-U.S. markets. We have also received FDA approval of AMJEVITA, a biosimilar to Humira for the U.S. market, and plan to launch in the United States in January 2023. In 2020, we launched AVSOLA, a biosimilar to Remicade; and in January 2021, we launched RIABNI, a biosimilar to Rituxan. We expect additional biosimilar competition against both our branded and biosimilar products in the future across markets.Although most of our products are biologics, some are small molecule products. Because the FDA approval process permits generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product rather than having to conduct their own costly and time-consuming clinical trials, generic manufacturers can often develop and market their competing versions of our small molecule products at much lower prices. For example, following loss of exclusivity of patents directed to cinacalcet, the active ingredient in our small molecule calcimimetic Sensipar, we lost a significant share of the market and corresponding revenues in a very short period of time. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The introduction of new products, the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result in (i) increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents and/or (ii) reductions in the prices we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates. (As used in this document, the term clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials, observational studies, registries and other studies.) See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition and Item 1A. Risk Factors—We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.8The following table reflects our significant competitors and is not exhaustive.ProductTerritoryCompetitor-marketed productCompetitorsENBRELU.S. & CanadaHUMIRAAbbVieU.S.XeljanzPfizer Inc.U.S. & CanadaRINVOQAbbVieProliaU.S. & EuropeAlendronate, raloxifene and zoledronate genericsVariousOtezlaU.S. & EuropeHUMIRA†AbbVieU.S. & EuropeCosentyxNovartisU.S. & EuropeTaltzLillyU.S. & EuropeTremfyaJanssen(1)U.S. & EuropeSkyrizi(2)AbbVieU.S. & EuropeMethotrexate genericsVariousXGEVAU.S. & EuropeZoledronate genericsVariousNeulasta(3)U.S.UDENYCACoherus BioSciences, Inc.U.S.FulphilaMylan Institutional Inc.U.S. & EuropeFilgrastim biosimilarsVariousAranespU.S.PROCRIT(4)Janssen(1)U.S. & EuropeEpoetin alfa biosimilarsVariousRepathaU.S. & EuropePRALUENTRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.SanofiKYPROLIS(5)U.S.VELCADEMillennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(6)U.S. & EuropeREVLIMIDCelgene(7)U.S. & EuropePOMALYST/IMNOVIDCelgene(7)U.S. & EuropeDARZALEXJanssen(1)NplateU.S. & EuropePROMACTA/REVOLADENovartis† Approved biosimilars available in Europe and Canada.(1)A subsidiary of J&J.(2)Dermatology only.(3)Other biosimilars under regulatory review in the United States and Europe.(4)PROCRIT competes with Aranesp in supportive cancer care and predialysis settings.(5)KYPROLIS is facing increased competition from several recently approved products.(6)A subsidiary of Takeda.(7)A subsidiary of BMS.Reimbursement Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. In many markets around the world, these payers, including government health systems, private health insurers and other organizations, remain focused on reducing the cost of healthcare; and their efforts have intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs, economic pressures and broader challenges generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Drugs remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment. As a result, payers are becoming more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products and are scrutinizing the prices of these products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefits such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system. These pressures become intensified when our products become subject to competition, including from biosimilars.9In the United States, healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and PBMs are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through both private-payer and government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. We provide negotiated rebates to healthcare providers, private payers, government payers and PBMs. In addition, we are required to (i) provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) provide discounts to qualifying healthcare providers under the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. Both private and some government payers use formularies to manage access to and utilization of drugs. A drug’s inclusion and favorable positioning on a formulary are essential to ensure patients have access to a particular drug. Even when access is available, some patients abandon their prescriptions for economic reasons. Payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization and/or spending altogether and/or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include, but are not limited to, more-limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance obligations, limitations on patients’ use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs), stricter utilization management criteria before a patient may get access to a drug, higher-tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs and formulary exclusion, which effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify and has thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales. Furthermore, during the past few years, many PBMs and insurers have consolidated, resulting in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria and/or exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. In highly competitive treatment markets such as the markets for ENBREL, Otezla, Repatha and Aimovig, PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order for them to gain and/or maintain their formulary position.In addition to market actions taken by private and government payers in the United States, policy makers in both of the major U.S. political parties are pursuing policies to lower drug costs. Potential policies cover a wide range of areas, including allowing the importation of drugs from other countries; instituting IRP schemes, which would set the prices of certain drugs based on those available in other countries; implementing policies that in effect would require manufacturers to accept government-set prices for certain drugs, with price ceilings based on a domestic reference-pricing scheme; redesigning the Medicare Part D benefit so as to establish a cap on patient out-of-pocket costs, paired with new requirements that manufacturers cover a share of the costs of Part D drugs; stipulating penalties if drug price benchmarks rise faster than inflation; increasing transparency in drug pricing; and using third-party value assessments to determine drug prices. Examples of such policies include, but are not limited to, the previous Administration’s November 2020 interim final rule, which attempts to institute an MFN IRP model in Medicare Part B and a final rule instituting rebate reform in Medicare Part D. Both of the resulting rules are being challenged in court and have not yet been implemented. Further, although CMS withdrew the MFN IRP, policy makers continue to express strong interest in policies to address drug pricing. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law on November 15, 2021, delays implementation of the rebate reform rule until 2026 and requires manufacturers of certain Part B–covered drugs packaged in single-use containers to give refunds to the government starting in 2023 for discarded amounts. Although the direction of drug-pricing-policy reforms remains unclear at this time, Congress is continuing to consider prescription-drug-pricing reforms, including legislative proposals for a number of the concepts discussed above (including a full repeal of the prior Administration’s Part D rebate reform rule).In many countries other than the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in mandates, incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many countries have health technology assessment organizations that use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine prices, coverage and reimbursement of new therapies; and these organizations are expanding in both established and emerging markets. Many countries also limit coverage to populations narrower than those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit utilization. We expect that countries will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. The EU is currently undergoing a review and possible revision of its pharmaceutical legislation, scheduled to conclude at the end 2022. There is a risk that this review will lead to proposals that may reduce intellectual property protection for new products, as well as change the reimbursement and regulatory landscape in ways that are difficult to predict at this point.10The dynamics and developments discussed above create pressures on the pricing and potential usage of our products and on the industry. Given the diverse interests in play between payers, biopharmaceutical manufacturers, policy makers, healthcare providers and independent organizations, if and whether the parties involved can achieve alignment on the matters discussed above remain unclear, and the outcome of any such alignment is difficult to predict. We remain focused on pricing our products responsibly and delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines. We do this by:•investing billions of dollars annually in R&D•pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide;•developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably supplied biosimilars;•partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes;•providing patient support and education programs; •helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and•working with policy makers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and in which patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers.See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability and Item 1A. Risk Factors—Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw MaterialsManufacturingWe believe we are a leader in the manufacture of biologics and that our manufacturing capabilities represent a competitive advantage. The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Further, our expertise in the manufacture of biologics positions us well for leadership in the global biosimilars market. For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties.We have been innovating our manufacturing facilities designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network and/or by mitigating risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products. For example, our licensed next-generation biomanufacturing plant operating in Singapore, and our recently FDA approved facility in West Greenwich, Rhode Island, incorporate multiple innovative technologies into a single facility. Next-generation biomanufacturing plants require smaller manufacturing footprints and offer greater environmental benefits, including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower levels of carbon emissions. Within such plants, the equipment is portable and smaller, which provides greater flexibility and speed in the manufacture of different medicines simultaneously. This enables Amgen to respond to changing demands for its medicines with increased agility. The Singapore site also has a plant that has been approved by several agencies, including the FDA and EMA, to produce small molecule drugs for commercial manufacturing.Our internal manufacturing network has commercial production capabilities for bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill, finish, tableting and device assembly. These activities are performed within the United States and its territories in our Puerto Rico, Rhode Island and California facilities as well as internationally in our Ireland, Netherlands and Singapore facilities. In addition, we use third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our commercial manufacturing network.To support our clinical trials, we manufacture product candidates primarily at our California facilities. We also use third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our overall clinical manufacturing network.See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products. 11DistributionWe operate distribution centers in Puerto Rico, Kentucky, California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. We also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide.OtherIn addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, each of our manufacturing locations includes key manufacturing support functions such as quality control, process development, engineering, procurement, production scheduling and warehousing. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as international regulatory agencies. See Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Regulation of Manufacturing Standards.Manufacturing InitiativesAs discussed above, we have been expanding capacity and advancing new innovations with multiple ongoing projects.Our next-generation biomanufacturing plant at our West Greenwich, Rhode Island, campus, the first of its kind in the United States, received FDA approval in January 2022. This plant expands our capacity to manufacture certain products for U.S. and global markets, as we receive regulatory approval in those markets.We initiated projects in 2019 to expand our clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities in Thousand Oaks, California, which we have completed.In August 2021, we initiated a project to build a new multi-product drug substance manufacturing facility in Holly Springs, North Carolina. The new plant will support both traditional stainless steel-fed batch manufacturing and next-generation single-use technologies, allowing flexibility in the production of multiple products in one plant.In November 2021, we broke ground for our newest biomanufacturing plant located in New Albany, Ohio. This final product assembly and packaging plant will support the growing demand for Amgen’s medicines in the United States and will use state-of-the-art technologies.See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.Raw Materials and Medical DevicesCertain raw materials, medical devices (including companion diagnostics) and components necessary for the commercial and/or clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only sources for such materials. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by means of inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.We perform various procedures to help authenticate the sources of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products; the procedures include verification of country of origin and are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform.To better ensure supply, Amgen has a risk mitigation strategy that uses a combination of methods, including multiple sources or backup inventory of critical raw materials. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and as part of our ongoing business continuity efforts, we continue to closely monitor our inventory levels and have taken additional measures to mitigate against raw material supply interruption. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products.Government RegulationRegulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities. To clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. Compliance with these standards is complex, and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant implications. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of factors, including global regulatory implications, that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial products.12Regulation in the United StatesIn the United States, the Public Health Service Act; the FDCA; and the regulations promulgated thereunder as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion and distribution of our products in addition to the reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals.Clinical Development and Product Approval. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky, and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are typically very long—approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable risk–benefit profile. We continue to work toward reducing cycle times by applying our expertise in human genetics and innovation in technology, clinical trials and real-world evidence.After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an IND with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake an FDA-designated three-phase human clinical testing program.•In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects.•In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side-effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a patient population larger than phase 1 but still relatively small, who have the disease or condition under study.•In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of our product candidates, compared to commonly used treatments, in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s risk–benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of either a BLA for biologic products or a New Drug Application for small molecule products. We are not permitted to market or promote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application.Approval of Biosimilars. The ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the nonclinical-trial and clinical-trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be “highly similar” and to have no clinically meaningful differences with regard to safety, purity and potency. The relevance of demonstrating “similarity” is that in many cases, biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators, because risk–benefit has previously been established. To preserve incentives for future innovation, the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators’ products, which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originator’s data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after initial FDA approval of the originator product. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. As part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars, the FDA released a number of guidance documents, some of which remain in draft form.Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of drug products. Our product promotions for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA and the FDA’s implemented regulations and guidance. The FDA’s review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses but is not limited to direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare-provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of the FDA’s advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDA’s regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. Additionally, as described below, such failure may lead to additional liability under U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse laws.13Regulation of Manufacturing Standards. The FDA regulates and inspects the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to granting approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to reinspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval.Regulation of Combination Products. Combination products are defined by the FDA as products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well.Regulation outside the United StatesIn EU countries as well as in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States.In the EU, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any EU member state: a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure, identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies. Regulatory review is led by one member state (the reference-member state), and its assessment—based on safety, quality and efficacy—is reviewed and approved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other member states from which the applicant is seeking approval (the concerned-member states). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single Marketing Authorisation Application to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMA’s CHMP adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the EC for final decision on granting of the marketing authorization. Even though the EC generally follows the CHMP’s opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval.In the EU, biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway, an applicant seeks and obtains regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired, relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is “highly similar” with regard to quality, safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area.Other countries such as Russia, Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements.In Asia Pacific, a number of countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical-trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. In most of the Asian markets, registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU. In some markets in Asia, such as China, Indonesia and Thailand, regulatory timelines can be less predictable. The regulatory process may also include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. Countries such as Australia and Japan have more-mature systems that would allow for submissions under more-competitive time frames. With regard to biosimilars, several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars (e.g., Australia, India, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), and biosimilar products are already present on the markets (e.g., Australia and South Korea).In some countries, such as Japan and those in the EU, medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby manufacturers must establish that their medical devices conform to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category. For example, in the EU, with limited exceptions, medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformité Européenne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements.14Postapproval PhaseAfter approval, we continue to monitor adverse events and product complaints reported following the use of our products through routine postmarketing surveillance and studies when applicable. We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies as required by local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports. We proactively monitor (according to good pharmacovigilance practices) and ensure the implementation of signal detection, assessment and the communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products. We also proactively monitor product complaints through our quality systems, which includes assessing our drug delivery devices for device complaints, adverse events and malfunctions. We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. Health regulators, including the FDA, have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product’s life cycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products.Health regulators, including the FDA, also have authority both before and after approval to require that a company implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. In the United States, such a risk management program is known as a REMS; and we currently have REMSs for Prolia, Nplate and BLINCYTO.Other RegulationWe are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including antikickback laws and false-claims laws. Antikickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescribing of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False-claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under false-claims laws may also arise when violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying product (e.g., a violation regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim.On April 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations related to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access medicines. Additionally, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement that requires us to both maintain a corporate compliance program and undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that in the future, our practices might be further challenged under antikickback or similar laws. The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA arguably includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws and/or regulations. Failure by our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators to comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws and/or regulations could result in significant civil or criminal penalties.We are subject to various laws and regulations globally with regard to privacy and data protection. These laws and regulations involve the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. The legislative and regulatory environments regarding privacy and data protection are continually evolving and developing because these issues are subjects of increasing amounts of attention in countries globally. For example, we are subject to the EU’s GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective on January 1, 2020 and China’s Personal Information Protection Law, which became effective on November 1, 2021. Other jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation and/or regulations. For example, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act are set to become effective on January 1, 2023, and July 1, 2023, respectively. Failure to comply with these laws could result in significant penalties.Our business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and regulations. See Reimbursement section above.15Research and Development and Selected Product CandidatesWe focus our R&D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness. We capitalize on our strengths in human genetics, novel biology and protein engineering. We leverage our biologic expertise and seek to choose the optimal modality for a drug target and disease. And we use cutting-edge science and technology to study subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases.Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, other combination modalities or new modalities. We have reshaped our portfolio and have increasingly focused our efforts on human genetics when possible to enhance the likelihood of success.Since early 2021, COVID-19 global vaccination efforts have been under way to control the pandemic. However, uncertainty remains as to the length of time required for vaccination of a meaningful portion of the population and as to the efficacy of such vaccinations on the trajectory of the pandemic. Challenges to vaccination efforts, new variants and other causes of virus spread may require governments to issue additional restrictions and/or order shutdowns in various geographies. As a result, we expect to see continued volatility for at least the duration of the pandemic as governments respond to current local conditions. With regard to our drug development activities, we are continuously monitoring COVID-19 infection rates, including changes from new variants; we are working to mitigate effects on future study enrollment in our clinical trials; and we are evaluating the impact in all countries where clinical trials occur. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in their providing care for patients and in our providing investigational drug supply.For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our R&D expenses were $4.8 billion, $4.2 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively.We have major R&D centers in Thousand Oaks and San Francisco, California; Iceland; and the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties.Our clinical trial activities are conducted by both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. To increase the number and diversity of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened clinical sites and will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Clinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also see Item 1A. Risk Factors—We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.Some of our competitors are actively engaged in R&D in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is greatly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, thereby contributing to a product’s eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position.In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal R&D efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and R&D technology rights and establish R&D arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing these R&D arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the R&D.The following table shows a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 8, 2022, unless otherwise indicated. Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. (The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) The information in this section does not include other, nonregistrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication.We may conduct nonregistrational clinical trials for various reasons, including to evaluate real-world outcomes or to collect additional safety information with regard to the use of products.16MoleculeInvestigational indicationPhase 3 programsAMJEVITAInterchangeabilityBemarituzumabGEJ adenocarcinomaBLINCYTOPh-negative B-cell precursor Acute lymphoblastic leukemiaEVENITYMale osteoporosisKYPROLISWeekly dosing for relapsed multiple myelomaNplateChemotherapy-induced thrombocytopeniaOtezlaGenital psoriasisRepathaCardiovascular diseaseTEZSPIREChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polypsSevere asthmaABP 654Investigational biosimilar to STELARA (ustekinumab)ABP 938Investigational biosimilar to EYLEA (aflibercept)ABP 959Investigational biosimilar to SOLIRIS (eculizumab)Phase 2 programsEfavaleukin alfaSystemic lupus erythematosusUlcerative colitisLUMAKRAS/LUMYKRASAdvanced colorectal cancerNSCLC monotherapyOther solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutationsOlpasiranCardiovascular diseaseOrdesekimabCeliac diseaseOtezlaPalmoplantar pustulosisRozibafusp alfaSystemic lupus erythematosusTarlatamabSmall cell lung cancerTEZSPIREChronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseChronic spontaneous urticariaAMG 451/KHK 4083Atopic dermatitisPhase 1 programsAcapatamabProstate cancerPavurutamabMultiple myelomaTarlatamabSmall-cell lung cancerAMG 104AsthmaAMG 119Small-cell lung cancerAMG 133ObesityAMG 176Hematologic malignanciesAMG 193Solid tumorsAMG 199Metastatic GEJ cancerAMG 256Solid tumorsAMG 330Acute myeloid leukemiaAMG 340Prostate cancerAMG 404Solid tumorsAMG 427Acute myeloid leukemiaAMG 506Solid tumorsAMG 509Prostate cancerAMG 609Nonalcoholic steatohepatitisAMG 650Solid tumorsAMG 994Solid tumors17Phase 3Clinical trials investigate the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of our product candidates, compared to commonly used treatments, in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.Phase 2Clinical trials investigate side-effect profiles and efficacy of product candidates in a larger patient population than phase 1, but still relatively small, who have the disease or condition under study.Phase 1Clinical trials investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of product candidates in a small number of human subjects.Phase 3 Product Candidate Program ChangesAs of February 2, 2021, we had 13 phase 3 programs. As of February 8, 2022, we continued to have 13 phase 3 programs, as regulatory approvals were received for three programs, four programs initiated phase 3 studies and one program was terminated.

In addition, we acquire product and R&D technology rights and establish R&D collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed-product base. These arrangements generally provide for nonrefundable, upfront license fees, development and commercial-performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature.Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require counterparties to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of a business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.BeiGene, Ltd.On January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. Under the collaboration, BeiGene began selling XGEVA in 2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in early 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China of such products for a specified period.In addition, we jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiGene, which shares in global R&D costs by providing cash and development services of up to $1.25 billion. Upon regulatory approval, BeiGene will assume commercialization rights in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiGene will share profits equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen will also pay royalties to BeiGene.NovartisWe are in a collaboration with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize Aimovig. On January 31, 2022, concurrent with the settlement of the previously disclosed litigation between Amgen and Novartis we modified the terms of the collaboration. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Arrangement through December 31, 2021In the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly developed and collaborated on the commercialization of Aimovig. Amgen, as the principal, recognized product sales of Aimovig in the United States, shared U.S. commercialization costs with Novartis and paid Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis held global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig (the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights). Novartis paid Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories and funded a portion of global R&D expenses. In addition, Novartis was required to make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds were achieved with respect to Aimovig in the United States. Arrangement after January 1, 2022Pursuant to the amendment effective January 1, 2022, Novartis retains the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights and will continue to pay double-digit royalties on net sales in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories. In the United States, Novartis will no longer collaborate with Amgen, share Aimovig commercialization costs or pay milestones and Amgen will no longer pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Aimovig. Amgen and Novartis will continue to share development expenses worldwide.Amgen manufactures and supplies Aimovig worldwide.21DaVita Inc.In January 2017, we entered into a six-year supply agreement with DaVita, which superseded the previously existing, seven-year supply agreement that commenced in 2012. Pursuant to the 2017 agreement, we supply EPOGEN and Aranesp in amounts necessary to meet specified annual percentages of DaVita’s and its affiliates’ requirements for ESAs used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico. Such percentages vary during the term of the agreement, but in each year are at least 90%. The agreement expires in December 2022. The agreement may be terminated by either party before expiration of its term in the event of certain breaches of the agreement by the other party.For financial information about our significant collaborative arrangements, see Part IV—Note 8, Collaborations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Human Capital ResourcesOverviewAmgen’s approach to human capital resource management starts with our mission to serve patients. We strive to serve patients by transforming the promise of science and biotechnology into therapies that have the power to restore health or save lives. The way we approach our business is guided by our Amgen Values:Amgen ValuesBe Science-BasedCompete Intensely and WinCreate Value for Patients, Staff and StockholdersBe EthicalTrust and Respect Each OtherEnsure QualityWork in TeamsCollaborate, Communicate and Be AccountableOur staff are also guided by the Company’s Code of Conduct, which is designed to help every person who does business on our behalf worldwide (including all staff, management, consultants, contract workers and temporary workers) to understand what is expected of them.Our industry exists in a complex regulatory and reimbursement environment. The unique demands of our industry, together with the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of innovative medicines, requires a highly engaged and committed workforce.As of December 31, 2021, Amgen had approximately 24,200 staff members in over 50 countries, and we have had relatively low global turnover rates. We also supplement our workforce with independent contractors, contingent workers and temporary workers, as needed. Outside of the United States, some of our employees are represented by unions or works councils. We consider our staff relations to be good, supported by regular assessments of staff engagement surveys on a wide range of topics (including engagement in the COVID-19 environment, diversity, inclusion and belonging, and maintaining a culture of compliance). We discuss the results of these surveys with our workforce and our Board of Directors. Compensation, Benefits and DevelopmentOur approach to employee compensation and benefits is designed to deliver cash, equity and benefit programs that are competitive with those offered by leading companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries to attract, motivate and retain talent with a focus on encouraging performance, promoting accountability and adherence to Company values and alignment with the interests of the Company’s shareholders.Our base pay program aims to compensate staff members relative to the value of the contributions of their role, which takes into account the skills, knowledge and abilities required to perform each position, as well as the experience brought to the job. We also provide annual incentive programs to reward our staff in alignment with achievement of Company-wide goals that are established annually and designed to drive aspects of our strategic priorities that support and advance our strategy across our Company. The majority of our staff members are also eligible for the grant of equity awards under our long-term incentive program that are designed to align the experience of these staff with that of our shareholders. All staff also participate in a regular performance measurement process through which staff receive performance and development feedback, and pay is aligned to performance. To support the development of our staff, we provide a variety of programs, including leadership development programs, virtual instructor-led courses and self-paced learning options.22Our benefit programs are also generally broad-based, promote health and overall well-being and emphasize saving for retirement. All regular U.S. staff members are eligible to participate in the same core health and welfare and retirement savings plans. Other U.S. employee benefits include medical plans, dental plans, adoption assistance, paid parental leave programs, access to childcare, employee assistance programs, employee stock purchase plan, flexible spending accounts, life, long-term care and business travel accident insurance, short and long-term disability benefits, wellness benefits and work-life resources and referrals. Comparable programs and benefits are available globally, with the same health and well-being intent, consistent with statutory requirements.Our Compensation and Management Development Committee provides oversight of our compensation plans, policies and programs.Safety and Wellness and Our Response to COVID-19Creating a safe and healthy workplace for our staff is a priority at Amgen. Our goal is to have a world class safety record through safety leadership, risk management practices and integrating safety throughout our business processes. To foster our safety culture, we implement a comprehensive safety program, driving to understand and mitigate the root cause of safety incidents and manage and control variability. We use leading indicators to assess the effectiveness of our safety programs and make course corrections as needed. Additionally, we perform formal executive management review of functional safety performance for Operations, Global Commercial Operations and R&D on a quarterly basis with a focus on identifying early signals and taking action to drive continuous improvement. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and as part of our commitment to work to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, for 2020 and much of 2021, we have activated our applicable business continuity plans, including having those of our employees who were able to work from home to do so, and for employees returning to the workplace and the field, we took additional safety measures, including implementing occupancy limits, restricting business travel, providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, temperature screening and COVID-19 testing to access our workplaces. Staff member access to our facilities has been in accordance with applicable government health and safety protocols and guidance issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2021 we required staff members in the United States and Puerto Rico to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.1 In the fourth quarter of 2021, we enabled our U.S. based workforce to return to the workplace for work that benefits from face-to-face interactions, while maintaining appropriate safety measures to ensure staff well-being. This approach intentionally combines the benefits of remote and in-person working at Amgen for the future as COVID-19 restrictions ease around the globe. We will continue to learn and adapt this approach as needed for the future.Our Corporate Responsibility and Compliance Committee provides general oversight of our safety programs and initiatives, while our Board of Directors, as a whole, has overseen our specific responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.Diversity, Inclusion and BelongingWe believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation, which supports our ability to serve patients. Further, we also believe our global presence is strengthened by having a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients we serve. It is with these beliefs in mind that we have continued to strengthen and grow our culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging. Our internal efforts include, in 2019, establishing a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Council chaired by our Chief Executive Officer. In 2020, we implemented a global unconscious-bias training program, and we launched an ongoing learning journey with tools and resources that guides staff on the role they play in creating diversity, inclusion and belonging throughout the organization. Each of Amgen’s ERGs is sponsored by an executive leader who reports to the CEO. We are leveraging our ERGs to represent and support the diversity of Amgen staff, while also providing opportunities to Amgen’s business and the community. 1 The vaccination requirement did not apply to staff who were unable to receive a COVID-19 vaccine because of qualifying religious or medical reasons.23Employee Resource GroupsAmgen Asian Association (AAA)Amgen Black Employee Network (ABEN)Ability Bettered through Leadership and Education (ABLE), a resource group for those with disabilities, visible and invisible, including those conditions also experienced by the patients that Amgen serves.Amgen Early Career Professionals (AECP)Amgen Indian Subcontinent Network (AISN)Amgen Latin Employee Network (ALEN)Amgen LGBTQ and Allies Network (PRIDE)Amgen Veterans Employees Network (AVEN)Women Empowered to be Exceptional (WE2)Women in Information Systems Enrichment (WISE)Amgen International Network (AIN)For 2021, to tangibly deepen and drive our diversity, inclusion and belonging activities enterprise-wide and actively communicate our culture of belonging to all staff, we established an annual diversity, inclusion and belonging goal for leaders at executive director and above levels to establish, document and execute diversity, inclusion and belonging action plans, with a target goal of 75% participation, which we achieved and exceeded in 2021. In areas of underrepresentation, we develop plans with a goal of bringing our representation in line with availability. We engage in outreach efforts to attract, retain and advance more women and minorities in our workforce. For example, we have worked to enhance our diverse candidate recruiting pool by developing relationships with organizations that can serve as a source of diverse candidates, such as the National Black MBA Association and National Sales Network, as well as historically black colleges and universities. In 2021, a fellowship program between Amgen and Howard University was established to expand the talent pool and diversify ranks in research and development. Additionally, at the end of 2020, we became a founding member of OneTen, a coalition of the world’s largest, best-known companies, that aims to hire one million Black Americans (with a specific focus on those without four-year college degrees) into good-paying, family-sustaining jobs over the next ten years. As a member of OneTen, Amgen is taking a leadership role in the greater Los Angeles region, where the company is headquartered, to help expand the coalition organizations that share our desire to offer opportunities to diverse talent. Other examples of actions that we are taking in this area include investment and participation in the Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association (a global organization focused on development and business networking for women in healthcare) and the UCLA Anderson School of Management leadership programs for women and underrepresented talent.Our 2020 Consolidated EEO-1 Report can be viewed on our website at www.amgen.com (the website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained in our website is not intended to be a part of this filing).In 2021, our Corporate Responsibility and Compliance Committee provided oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on workforce diversity and inclusion.

(These website addresses are not intended to function as hyperlinks, and the information contained in our website and in the SEC’s website is not intended to be a part of this filing.)Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. SUMMARYRisks Related to Economic Conditions and Operating a Global Business, Including During the COVID-19 Pandemic•The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations.•A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation.•Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.Risks Related to Government Regulations and Third-Party Policies•Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability.•Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.•The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.•Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.Risks Related to Competition•Our products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition.•Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation. •We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.•Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.26Risks Related to Research and Development•We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&D.•We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.•Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.•Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.•Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products.•Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions.Risks Related to Operations•We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.•We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.•Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.•Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives.•The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations.General Risk Factors•Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.•Our stock price is volatile.•We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.RISKS RELATED TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS, INCLUDING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMICThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations.The novel coronavirus identified in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, is an ongoing global pandemic that has resulted in public and governmental efforts to contain or slow the spread of the disease, including widespread shelter-in-place orders, social distancing interventions, quarantines, travel restrictions and various forms of operational shutdowns. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting measures implemented in response to the pandemic are adversely affecting, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, our business (including our R&D, clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development and sales activities), the business activities of our suppliers, customers, third-party payers and our patients. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval; see also We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Due to the pandemic and these measures and their effects, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products, exacerbated by COVID-19 surges resulting in repeated shutdowns and/or disruptions in certain geographies.Federal, state and local, and international governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 also have resulted in the cancellation or delay of diagnostic, elective, specialty and other procedures and 27appointments to avoid non-essential patient exposure to medical environments and potential infection with COVID-19 and to focus limited resources and personnel capacity toward the treatment of COVID-19. For example, an NPR/Harvard poll in 2021 found that, with hospitals crowded from COVID-19, one in five U.S. households has had to delay care for serious illnesses. These measures and challenges will likely continue to varying degrees for the duration of the pandemic and have significantly reduced patient access to, and administration of, certain of our drugs. For example, Prolia requires administration by a healthcare provider in doctors’ offices or other healthcare settings that are affected by COVID-19. The U.S. label for Prolia instructs healthcare professionals who discontinue Prolia to transition the patient to an alternative antiresorptive, including oral treatments that do not require administration by a healthcare provider. Further, as a result of COVID-19, oncology patients, in consultation with their doctors, may be selecting therapies that are less immunosuppressive or therapies that do not require administration in a hospital setting, potentially adversely affecting sales of certain of our products. Also, new patients have been, and are expected to continue to be, less likely to be diagnosed and/or to start therapeutics during the pandemic, and these effects, together with the lower treatment rates during the pandemic, have had, and are expected to continue to have, a cumulative negative effect on the commercial performance of our business. The decrease in diagnoses over the course of the pandemic has suppressed the volume of new patients starting treatment, which we expect to continue to impact our business. Once the pandemic subsides, we anticipate there could be a backlog of patients seeking appointments with physicians relating to a variety of medical conditions, and as a result, patients seeking treatment with certain of our products may have to navigate lower provider capacity, and this lower provider capacity could have a continued adverse effect on our sales following the opening up of various geographies and/or the end of the pandemic. Further, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in long-term shifts in preferences among healthcare professionals and patients toward treatments that do not require administration by healthcare professionals or visits to medical facilities.As the pandemic continues, and if conditions worsen or if the duration of the pandemic extends significantly, we expect to experience additional adverse effects on our development, operational and commercial activities, customer purchases and our collections of accounts receivable. It remains uncertain the degree to which these adverse effects would impact our future operational and commercial activities, customer purchases and our collections as conditions begin to improve. There was a resurgence in COVID-19 infections in numerous jurisdictions in 2021, resulting in the reinstatement of stricter restrictions and shutdowns in a number of jurisdictions, including in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. It is expected that the pandemic will continue to ebb and flow, with different jurisdictions having higher levels of infections than others over the course of the pandemic. New variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have emerged, including the delta and omicron variants, and have been shown to be present in many geographies and appear to spread more easily and quickly than other variants. Further, although some studies suggest that antibodies generated with currently authorized vaccines may be effective against these variants, it remains uncertain whether currently available vaccines will retain their efficacy against future variants of the virus. Further, even while vaccine booster shots are available for certain patients, persistent vaccine hesitancy may result in under-vaccinated populations which may prolong the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to disrupt the availability of healthcare services to the patients we serve. Jurisdictions may implement, continue or reinstate border closures, impose or reimpose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity. These measures could significantly affect our ability to support our operations and customers and the ability of our employees to get to their workplaces to discover, study, develop and produce our product candidates and products, disrupt the movement of our products through the supply chain, and further prevent or discourage patients from participating in our clinical trials, seeking healthcare services and the administration of certain of our products. The increased availability of remote working arrangements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. Further, in connection with the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and in an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical products, we or our suppliers may elect to, or governments may require us or our suppliers to, allocate manufacturing capacity (for example pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act) in a way that adversely affects our regular operations, customer relationships and financial results. In the United States, on January 21, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order instructing federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including the Defense Production Act, to improve current and future pandemic response and biological threat preparedness. The rapid reallocation of resources for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 (including the production of COVID-19 vaccinations or related therapies, such as our agreement to contribute to the production of COVID-19 antibody therapies for Lilly) and/or disruptions and shortages in the global supply chain caused by the pandemic, could also result in increased competition for, or reduced availability of, materials or components used in the development, manufacturing, distribution, or administration of our products. For example, during the second quarter of 2021, an industry-wide shortage of certain lab kit supplies necessary for some activities that support our clinical trials has developed that we are actively monitoring and managing. We have also experienced challenges in obtaining certain COVID-19-related supplies, including COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits for our staff, as a result of high demand and limited supplies during the omicron variant surge. In addition, unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products could exceed our capacity to meet such demand, which could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships.The COVID-19 pandemic and the volatile global economic conditions stemming from it may precipitate or amplify the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, which could materially adversely affect our business, operations and 28financial condition and results. For example, if a natural disaster or other potentially disruptive event occurs concurrently with the COVID-19 pandemic, such disaster or event could deplete our inventory levels and we could experience a disruption to our manufacturing or ability to supply our products. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate effect of COVID-19 on us. The duration of the measures being taken by the authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19 (including the distribution and/or availability of vaccines and boosters), and the extent to which such measures are effective, if at all, remain highly uncertain. The magnitude and degree of COVID-19’s adverse effect on our business (including our product development, product sales, operating results and resulting cash flows) and financial condition will be driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic’s effect on the United States and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state, local and international governmental responses to the pandemic. If mitigation of the pandemic continues to require further shelter-in-place and shutdown orders and/or restrictions on individual and/or group conduct, any adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely grow and could be enduring, and our business and financial position could be materially adversely affected.A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation.To achieve our business objectives, we rely on sophisticated information technology systems, including software, mobile applications, cloud services and network-connected control systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties. Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business, result in significant costs and/or adversely affect our reputation.Our information technology systems are highly integrated into our business, including our R&D efforts, our clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and our product sales and distribution processes. Further, as the majority of our employees are working remotely, our reliance on our and third-party information technology systems has increased substantially and is expected to continue to increase. The complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions. Upgrades or changes to our systems or the software that we use may result in the introduction of new cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our systems are also subject to frequent cyberattacks. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Such attacks could include the use of harmful and virulent malware, including ransomware or other denials of service, that can be deployed through various means, including the software supply chain, e-mail, malicious websites and/or the use of social engineering. We have also experienced denial of service attacks against our network, and although such attacks did not succeed, there can be no assurance that our efforts to guard against the wide and growing variety of potential attack techniques will be successful in the future. Attacks such as those experienced by governmental entities (including those that approve and/or regulate our products, such as the EMA) and other multi-national companies, including some of our peers, could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access or protect important data, and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, including developing, gaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing, selling and/or distributing our products. For example, in 2017, a pharmaceutical company experienced a cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted its operations, including its research and sales operations and the production of some of its medicines and vaccines. As a result of the cyberattack, its orders and sales for certain products in certain markets were negatively affected. In December 2020, SolarWinds Corporation, a leading provider of software for monitoring and managing information technology infrastructure, disclosed that it had suffered a cybersecurity incident whereby attackers had inserted malicious code into legitimate software updates for its products that were installed by myriad private and government customers, enabling the attackers to access a backdoor to such systems. Our systems also contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory information, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials and/or personal information belonging to us, our staff, our patients, customers and/or other parties. In some cases, we utilize third-party service providers to process, store, manage or transmit such data, which may increase our risk. Intentional or inadvertent data privacy or security breaches (including cyberattacks) resulting from attacks or lapses by employees, service providers (including providers of information technology-specific services), nation states (including groups associated with or supported by foreign intelligence agencies), organized crime organizations, “hacktivists” or others, create risks that our sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons, our competitors, or the public. For example, a supplier recently experienced a data breach in which an unauthorized third party acquired access to certain information provided to the supplier in the course of its provision of services to us, including business documents and certain personally identifiable patient information (not including social security or other financial or health insurance information). As required, we promptly notified the applicable state attorneys general and the individuals whose personally identifiable information was affected of this data breach at the supplier. Although the supplier data breach did not result in a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that a similar 29future cybersecurity incident would not result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Another vendor experienced a cyberattack and, while initially reporting that our information was not involved, the vendor subsequently informed us that the attacker had accessed limited, non-significant information. Although this breach did not have a significant adverse effect on us, we may not receive timely reporting of future breaches. Cyberattackers are increasingly exploiting vulnerabilities in commercially available software from shared or open-source code. We rely on third party commercial software that may have such vulnerabilities, but as use of open-source code is frequently not disclosed, our ability to fully assess this risk to our systems is limited. For example, in December 2021, a remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in a widely used software library that is used in a variety of commercially available software and services. Although this vulnerability has not resulted in any significant adverse effects on us, there can be no assurances that a similar future vulnerability in the software and services that we use would not result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Domestic and global government regulators, our business partners, suppliers with whom we do business, companies that provide us or our partners with business services, and companies we have or may acquire face similar risks, and security breaches of their systems or service outages could adversely affect our security, leave us without access to important systems, products, raw materials, components, services or information or expose our confidential data or sensitive personal information. For example, in 2019, two vendors that perform testing and analytical services that we use in developing and manufacturing our products experienced cyberattacks, and in April and September of 2020, vendors that provide us with information technology services and clinical data services, respectively, each experienced ransomware attacks. Although there was no breach of our systems, each of these incidents required us to disconnect our systems from those vendors’ systems. While we were able to reconnect our systems following restoration of these vendors’ capabilities without significantly affecting product availability, a more extended service outage affecting these or other vendors, particularly where such vendor is the single source from which we obtain the services, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we distribute our products in the United States primarily through three pharmaceutical wholesalers, and a security breach that impairs the distribution operations of our wholesalers could significantly impair our ability to deliver our products to healthcare providers and patients.Although we have experienced system breakdowns, attacks and information security breaches, we do not believe such breakdowns, attacks and breaches have had a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We continue to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical and/or sensitive data and systems. However, there can be no assurances that our efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks and/or breaches of our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss or exposure of critical, proprietary, private, confidential or otherwise sensitive data, which could result in material financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us or negatively affect our stock price. While we maintain cyber-liability insurance, our insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses that could potentially result from a service interruption, breach of our systems or loss of our critical or sensitive data.We are also subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection, including laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. The legislative and regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection is continuously evolving and developing and the subject of significant attention globally. For example, we are subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which became effective in January 2020, both of which provide for substantial penalties for non-compliance. The CCPA was amended in late 2020, to create the California Privacy Rights Act to create opt-in requirements for the use of sensitive personal data and the formation of a new dedicated agency for the enforcement of the law, the California Privacy Protection Agency. Since then, Virginia and Colorado both passed similar consumer privacy laws that will go into effect in 2023. Other jurisdictions where we operate have passed, or continue to propose, similar legislation and/or regulations. Failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant penalties and reputational harm and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction, both independently and through collaborations such as our collaboration with BeiGene, of our products in new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Our international business, including in China and emerging market countries, may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including issues of geopolitical relations, the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions and/or sovereign debt issues. If relations between the United States and other governments deteriorate, our business and investments such markets may also be adversely affected. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements including those previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire 30in emerging markets. See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Our expansion efforts in China and emerging markets around the world is dependent upon the establishment of an environment that is predictable, navigable and supportive of biopharmaceutical innovation, sustained access for our products and predictable pricing controls. For example, China continues to strengthen regulations on the collection, use and transmission of Chinese human genetic resources, and has expanded regulations on the conduct of biotechnology R&D activities in China. Our applications to the HGRAC seeking approval to conduct clinical trials in China are delayed pending further guidance from HGRAC. Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, trade restrictions or other barriers designed to protect industry in the home country against foreign competition, far-reaching antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations and/or evolving legal and regulatory environments. As we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. In addition, we have a number of financial instruments referencing the LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administrator after 2021, and it is anticipated that LIBOR will be completely phased out and replaced by 2023. In March 2020 and in January 2021, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to ease the financial burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. While it appears likely that SOFR will be the replacement reference rate adopted in the market, the specific mechanisms to replace LIBOR in our existing LIBOR-linked financial instruments have not been finalized. As such, the replacement of LIBOR could have an adverse effect on the market for, or value of, our LIBOR-linked financial instruments. See Part IV—Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies—Recent accounting pronouncements. We are also subject to the economic and political uncertainties stemming from the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” which occurred on January 31, 2020. While our manufacturing and packaging activities take place largely outside the United Kingdom, minimizing the need to make costly and significant changes to those operations, we have nevertheless been working to put in place contingency plans to attempt to mitigate the effects of Brexit on us. Overall, the legal and operational challenges of our international business operations, along with government controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products, may result in material adverse effects on our international product sales, business and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND THIRD-PARTY POLICIESOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability.Sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to manage drug utilization and contain costs. These payers are increasingly focused on costs, which have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom payers will reimburse. Continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs, together with payer dynamics, have limited, and are likely to continue to limit, our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value, which can have a material adverse effect on our business. In the United States, particularly over the past few years, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced in an attempt to lower drug prices. These include proposals that would allow the U.S. government to negotiate drug prices directly, limit drug reimbursement in Medicare and/or the commercial market based on reference prices or permit importation of drugs from Canada. Additional proposals would require a rebate to the government for any price increase in excess of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers and/or to shift some of the costs of these Medicare Part D reforms to manufacturers to offset the cost. Certain proposals focused on drug pricing have been adopted and additional proposals are likely to be adopted and implemented in some form. —Changing U.S. federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices have affected, and may continue to affect access to, pricing and sales of our productsA substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by federal and state governments. See Part I, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. Our business has been and will continue to be affected by legislative actions changing U.S. federal reimbursement policy. Congress has been focused on drug pricing reforms and oversight since 2018, and this activity is still ongoing and has intensified. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, a number of Congressional committees debated drug pricing reform proposals and, in 2020, Amgen participated in House Oversight and Reform Committee hearings on drug pricing practices. In 2019, the Senate Finance Committee advanced a bill that would, among other things, penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers for raising prices on drugs 31covered by Medicare Parts B and/or D faster than the rate of inflation, cap out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare Part D beneficiaries and require higher/additional manufacturer discounts in Medicare Part D. Additionally, in late 2019, a drug-pricing bill, H.R. 3, passed the House of Representatives, which would, among other things, enable direct price negotiations by the federal government on certain drugs (with the maximum price paid by Medicare capped by prices derived from an international index), include a penalty for failing to reach agreement with the government and require that manufacturers offer these negotiated prices to other payers. In 2021, proposals from H.R. 3 were incorporated and adapted into other proposed legislation. These proposals, which included penalties if drug price benchmarks rise faster than inflation, Medicare price setting for certain drugs paid for under Parts B and D (whereby manufacturers must accept a price established by the government or face a penalty on all U.S. sales), and Part D redesign including a cap on beneficiary spending and a new manufacturer discount program, are also likely to be considered in a reconciliation bill that remains to be further debated between the Senate, House and White House. This framework remains in discussion with policymakers in Congress and the Administration. There are other outstanding proposals that, if enacted and implemented in whole or in part, could also affect access to and sales of our products, including, but not limited to, proposals to allow importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries. In July 2021, the Administration issued an Executive Order designed to address anticompetitive behavior across multiple sectors, and for the healthcare sector, called for, among other things, the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes to develop prescription drug importation programs, more scrutiny of anticompetitive activity by the FTC, emphasized the need for actions to allow for greater competition from generics and biosimilars, and included a process and timeline for federal agencies to deliver ideas to address drug pricing to the Administration. Subsequently, in September 2021, HHS released a report that presented guiding principles for the Administration’s drug pricing proposals, including changes to promote competition throughout the prescription drug industry, highlighting potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue (including drug price negotiation in Medicare Parts B and D, making those negotiated prices available to commercial plans and legislation to speed the entry of biosimilar and generic drugs) and examples of potential administrative tools available to the HHS (including testing various models and enhanced focus of the FTC and the USPTO to address impediments to generic drug and biosimilar competition). Also, in response to the July 2021 Executive Order, the FDA sent a letter to the USPTO describing ways to strengthen coordination between the two agencies, offering training to help identify prior art, and seeking USPTO’s views on practices that extend market exclusivities, whether pharmaceutical patent examiners need additional resources, and the effect of post-grant challenges at the PTAB on drug patents. Legislation enacted in 2021 has also contained drug pricing reforms, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 that include provisions requiring, starting in 2023, manufacturers to provide refunds to the government for discarded amounts of drugs from single use containers under Medicare Part B, and starting in 2024, increases the Medicaid rebate liability for certain medicines that raise prices in excess of inflation, respectively. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act also delays implementation until January 1, 2026 of a final rule issued by HHS, that revises regulations under the federal antikickback statute to encourage PBMs to use rebates received from biopharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce patient cost-sharing at the point of sale under Medicare Part D. This rule is also subject to litigation, has numerous logistical hurdles to overcome before it can be effectively implemented, and it is unclear how PBMs will respond to the implementation of such rule. Further, a permanent repeal of this rule is also being considered in other legislation.Our business has been, and is expected to continue to be, affected by changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy resulting from federal regulations and federal demonstration projects. Over the past several years, federal agencies, including the CMS, announced a number of recommendations, policies, proposals and demonstration projects addressing drug pricing. The Administration has also developed and sought to advance a range of policy proposals that could impact U.S. federal reimbursement policy for drugs and biologics, including changes to Medicare Parts B and D. For example, in 2020, in response to an Executive Order, HHS released a rule to allow states to potentially enable the importation of certain drugs from Canada. While this rule is in litigation, should such litigation be unsuccessful, it could allow for the importation of Canadian versions of certain of Amgen’s products (including Otezla), that could have a material adverse effect on Amgen’s business. Also in response to an Executive Order, CMS released an interim final rule to implement the MFN pricing approach aimed at setting the reimbursement rate for 50 Medicare Part B drugs (including our products, such as Prolia, XGEVA, KYPROLIS, Neulasta, Nplate, EPOGEN and Aranesp) equal to the lowest adjusted price in 22 OECD nations for these drugs. In December 2021, subsequent to challenges, including procedural defects, CMS announced it was withdrawing the MFN rule. Notwithstanding the withdrawal of the rule, the MFN rule’s approach to drug pricing and other similar approaches remain of interest to policymakers. In connection with its withdrawal of the MFN rule, CMS noted that it will “… explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B drugs, improve beneficiaries’ access to evidence-based care, and reduce drug spending for consumers and throughout the health care system.” Further, we expect continued significant focus on healthcare and similar drug pricing proposals for the foreseeable future, including proposals under which the government would set drug prices or limit drug reimbursement. CMS policy changes and demonstration projects to test new care, delivery and payment models can also significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. For example, we believe that CMS’ Oncology Care Model demonstration (which has since 2016 provided participating physician practices with performance-based financial 32incentives that aim to manage or reduce Medicare costs without negatively affecting the efficacy of care) has reduced utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and expect that it will continue to do so in the future. Further, HHS’s September 2021 comprehensive plan to address drug pricing included potential future mandatory models that link payment for prescription drugs and biologics to factors such as: improved patient outcomes, reductions in health disparities, patient affordability and lower overall costs; bundled payment models; total cost of care models; models in which Medicare Part B savings from utilization of biosimilars, generics, or other high-value products are shared between prescribing providers and the government; additional Medicare Part D cost-sharing support for biosimilars and generics; and potential expansion of the Part D Senior Savings Model to additional classes of drugs. CMS also recently proposed a national coverage determination for Medicare which limits coverage of certain Alzheimer’s disease medications approved by the FDA only to patients in qualifying clinical trials, suggesting that regulatory approval does not necessarily result in full Medicare coverage. In this dynamic environment, particularly in light of the pressures on healthcare budgets as a result of the pandemic, we are unable to predict which or how many federal policy, legislative, regulatory, executive or administrative changes may ultimately be, or effectively estimate the consequences to our business if, enacted and implemented. However, to the extent that these or other federal government initiatives further decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us, limit or affect our decisions regarding the pricing of or otherwise reduce the use of our U.S. products, or limit our ability to offer co-pay payment assistance to commercial patients, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. U.S. government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a biopharmaceutical manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts. CMS finalized a rule in December 2020 providing that, starting January 1, 2023, unless a manufacturer can ensure that the full amount of manufacturer patient assistance programs is passed on to the patient, such amount will be treated as a price reduction that will be taken into account when reporting our Best Price and/or Average Manufacturer Price. Given the use by PBMs and insurers of copay accumulator adjustment programs to apply such patient assistance for the benefit of such companies and not to defray costs to patients, it could be difficult to impossible for manufacturers to ensure that the full value of such amounts is being passed on to the patient. This new policy, if implemented, would have significant implications for our ability to offer copay assistance programs. Although implementation has been delayed by the current Administration, the prior Administration finalized a rule (which was to be effective January 1, 2022) mandating price and cost-sharing transparency for almost all health plans and insurers in the individual and group commercial markets. Additionally, the Administration recently finalized transparency provisions required under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 for health plans and insurer reporting of certain drug pricing information by December 27, 2022, and each June thereafter, resulting in a biennial public report highlighting drug pricing trends and the impact of prescription drug costs on premiums and out-of-pocket costs. It is unclear how group health plans and health insurers may respond.—Changing reimbursement and pricing actions in various states have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, access to, and have affected, and may continue to affect, sales of our productsAt the state level, government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. A number of states have adopted, and many other states are considering, drug importation programs or other new pricing actions, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers publicly to report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or place a maximum price ceiling or cap on biopharmaceutical products. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions. For example, a California law, the constitutionality of which is currently being challenged, purports to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds. Similar laws exist in Oregon and Washington. States are also seeking to change the way they pay for drugs for patients covered by state programs. California adopted a 2020-21 budget that incorporates international pricing into Medicaid supplemental rebate negotiations and allows its Medicaid program to seek federal approval to extend supplemental rebates to non-Medicaid populations. New York, Massachusetts and Ohio have established Medicaid drug spending caps, and additional states may consider doing so as they face budget deficits from the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Vermont have enacted laws, and several other states have proposed laws, to facilitate the importation of drugs from Canada. Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs. Ultimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.33—U.S. commercial payer actions have affected and may continue to affect access to and sales of our productsPayers, including healthcare insurers, PBMs, integrated healthcare delivery systems (vertically-integrated organizations built from the consolidation of healthcare insurers and PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their costs. With increasing frequency, payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater proportion of drug costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient copay or coinsurance obligations and more significant limitations on patients’ use of manufacturer commercial copay assistance programs. Further, government regulation of payers may affect these trends. For example, CMS finalized a policy in May 2020 (for plan years starting on or after January 1, 2021, and remains standing policy for 2022) that has caused commercial payers to more widely adopt copay accumulator adjustment programs. Payers have sought, and continue to seek, price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as Step Therapy, or requiring that patients receive the payer’s prior authorization before covering the product or that patients use a mail-order pharmacy or a limited network of payer fully-owned mail-order or specialty pharmacies. Payers have also chosen to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or chosen to exclude coverage entirely. For example, some payers require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha has been prescribed meet payer utilization management criteria, and these requirements have limited, and may continue to limit, patient access to Repatha treatment. In an effort to reduce barriers to access, we reduced the net price of Repatha by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers, including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. However, affordability of patient out-of-pocket co-pay cost has limited and may continue to limit patient use. For example, in late 2018 and early 2019, in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients, particularly those on Medicare, and on December 31, 2019, we discontinued the higher list price option for Repatha. Despite these net and list price reductions, some payers have restricted, and may continue to restrict, patient access and have and may continue to change formulary coverage for Repatha, seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, and negatively affect Repatha sales.Further, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs, which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discount and rebate requirements and limiting patient access and usage. For example, in the United States, as of the beginning of 2021, the top five integrated health plans and PBMs controlled about 85% of all pharmacy prescriptions. The consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including through integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mail-order pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers, and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, CVS, Express Scripts and United Health Group, respectively, each created Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their respective leverage to negotiate deeper discounts. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Policy reforms advanced by Congress or the Administration that refine the role of PBMs in the U.S. marketplace could have downstream implications or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities. See Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.—Government and commercial payer actions outside the United States have affected and will continue to affect access to and sales of our productsOutside the United States, we expect countries will also continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures. See Part I, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. IRP has been widely used by many countries outside the United States to control costs based on an external benchmark of a product’s price in other countries. IRP policies can change quickly and frequently and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. Other expenditure control practices, including but not limited to the use of revenue clawbacks, rebates and percentage caps on price increases, are used in various foreign jurisdictions as well. In addition, countries may refuse to reimburse or may restrict the reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or to meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds. For example, despite the EMA’s approval of Repatha for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, the reimbursement for Repatha in France prior to 2020 was limited to a narrower patient population (such as those with HoFH) following a national health technology assessment, which had limited our efforts in France to expand Repatha access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label. Some countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most or all of the sales in that country or region. Failure to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products, a deterioration in their existing coverage and 34reimbursement, or a decline in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers has negatively affected, and may further negatively affect, the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients and otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we realize for them. Such changes have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. Professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians’ groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, as well as patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies. In addition, a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical products, and even organizations whose guidelines have historically been focused on clinical matters have begun to incorporate analyses of the cost effectiveness of various treatments into their treatment guidelines and recommendations. Value assessments may come from private organizations that publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products’ reimbursement by government and private payers. Some companies and payers have announced pricing and payment decisions based in part on the assessments of private organizations. In addition, government health technology assessment organizations in many countries make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service effects of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Such health technology assessment organizations have recommended, and may in the future recommend, reimbursement for certain of our products for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies or may recommend against reimbursement entirely. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation, and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax.One or more of our legal entities file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in those jurisdictions. Significant disputes can arise with tax authorities involving issues regarding the timing and amount of deductions, the use of tax credits and allocations of income and expenses among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws, regulations and relevant facts, and such tax authorities (including the IRS) are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on such matters. In 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) for 2010, 2011 and 2012 that we received in May and July 2021 which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income. We firmly believe that the IRS’s positions set forth in the Notices are without merit, and are contesting the Notices through the judicial process. See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations, Income Taxes, and Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office. We were unable to reach resolution at the administrative appeals level, and we anticipate that we will receive a statutory notice of deficiency for these years as well. We expect to contest any such notice related to 2013–15 through the judicial process. We are also currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 and by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions.Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We continue to believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts 35and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. The 2017 Tax Act is complex and a large volume of regulations and guidance has been issued and could be subject to different interpretations. We could face audit challenges to our application of the 2017 Tax Act. The Administration proposed and Congress is considering significant changes to existing tax law. These changes, if enacted, could substantially increase taxes we pay to the U.S. government. Further, the OECD recently reached agreement to align countries on a minimum corporate tax rate and an expansion of the taxing rights of market countries. If enacted, this agreement could result in tax increases in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Treasury recently released final foreign tax credit regulations that eliminate U.S. creditability of the Puerto Rico Excise Tax beginning 2023, which will increase our U.S. tax liability. The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico is considering changes to its tax system that may minimize or eliminate this impact, but the outcome of such potential changes are uncertain. Changes to existing tax law in the United States, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, or other jurisdictions, including the potential changes discussed above, could result in tax increases where we do business and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time consuming and distracting, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management’s attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products.We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the United States and around the world. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar antibribery or anticorruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We cannot ensure that all our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. On April 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations relating to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines. As a result, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement, failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and potential exclusion from government healthcare programs. We may also see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. For example, prosecutors are placing greater scrutiny on patient support programs, including commercial copay assistance programs, and further enforcement actions and investigations regarding such programs could limit our ability to provide co-pay assistance to commercial patients. Greater scrutiny has also been placed on sponsorships, speaker programs and other arrangements where healthcare professionals receive remuneration, travel or other value to participate in certain events, and further enforcement actions could limit our ability to participate in such arrangements. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO COMPETITIONOur products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition.We operate in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. We expect that our products and product candidates will compete with existing drugs, new drugs 36currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products have expanded into, and are expected to continue expanding into, the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. With the proliferation of companies pursuing biopharmaceuticals, a number of our product candidates may enter markets with one or more competitors or with competitors soon to arrive. For example, several of our biosimilar products have entered into markets with one or more existing competitors. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market. As a result, our products have been competing and may continue to compete, and our product candidates may compete, against products or product candidates that offer higher rebates or discounts, lower prices, equivalent or superior efficacy, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive features. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Driven by cost pressures, efforts to limit or weaken patent protection for our industry are increasing. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased interest in compulsory licenses, march-in rights or other governmental interventions, both in the United States and internationally, related to the procurement of drugs. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Third parties have challenged and may continue to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentially-infringing product. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, are currently and expect to be in the future, involved in patent litigation. These matters have included, and may in the future include, litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the BPCIA. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation has not discouraged, and may not in the future discourage, a potential violator from bringing the allegedly infringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the losses, damages and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.Further, under the Hatch–Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the five-year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the 12-year exclusivity period provided under the BPCIA. In addition, we have faced, and may in the future face, patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies, including those that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products or who are developing or have developed other biosimilar versions of such products. Alternatively, patents held by other entities have contributed, and may in the future 37contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all of the same labeled indications as are held by these companies. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been delays in ongoing or new patent office and court proceedings in the United States and abroad that have delayed the outcome of such proceedings. While we have attempted, and expect to continue to attempt, to challenge the patents held by other companies, our efforts may be unsuccessful. For examples of and information related to our patent litigation, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Certain of the existing patents on our products have expired or will soon expire. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents. As our patents expire, competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, competitors have been, and may continue to be, able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products.We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics in most of the territories in which we operate, including the United States and Europe, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar and/or generics competition this year and beyond. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights or expiration of an applicable exclusivity period has accelerated such competition, and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products have also experienced greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive regulatory approval standards and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics, the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate.In the EU, biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some EU countries and some Canadian provinces have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, biosimilar uptake measures such as physician prescribing quotas or automatic pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. Some EU countries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors. While the degree of competitive effects of biosimilar competition differs between EU countries and between products, in the EU the overall use of biosimilars and the rate at which product sales of innovative products are being affected by biosimilar competition is increasing.In the United States, the BPCIA authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. See Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Approval of Biosimilars. In the United States, the FDA has approved numerous biosimilars, including biosimilar versions of Neulasta, EPOGEN and ENBREL, and a growing number of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products. Four biosimilar versions of Neulasta are now marketed in the United States, and we expect other biosimilar versions of Neulasta to receive approval in 2022 and beyond. Impact to our Neulasta sales has accelerated as additional competitors have launched. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. An approved biosimilar version of EPOGEN has also launched in the United States. Manufacturers of biosimilars have attempted, and may in the future attempt, to compete with our products by offering lower list prices, greater discounts or rebates, or contracts that offer longer-term pricing or a broader portfolio of other products. Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For examples of and information related to our biosimilars and generics patent litigation, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.The U.S. biosimilar pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to obtain interchangeable status from the FDA, which could potentially allow pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our reference products without prior approval from the prescriber in most states. The FDA approved the first interchangeable biosimilar in July 2021, and subsequently granted an interchangeability designation to a second biosimilar in October 2021. In November 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance that provides that comparative immunogenicity studies will not generally be expected for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. This may open the door for other product-specific guidance development and the removal of the expectation for certain studies, which may contribute to increased biosimilar competition for our innovative products. For example, the FDA 2021 guidance agenda lists four guidances related to biosimilars, including documents that address exclusivity for the first interchangeable biological product, and product class-specific recommendations for developing biosimilars and interchangeables.In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law’s provisions regarding which new 38products receive data exclusivity. In late 2019, the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products. Also, the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product’s original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as “umbrella exclusivity”). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period, this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and commercialization, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars and pass new laws requiring more disclosure in the FDA’s Orange and Purple Books. For example, in 2021 the FDA sent a letter to the USPTO describing ways to strengthen coordination between the two agencies, offered training to help identify prior art, and seeking USPTO’s views on practices that extend market exclusivities, whether pharmaceutical patent examiners need additional resources, and the effect of post-grant challenges at the PTAB on drug patents.Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our small molecule products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. Additionally, if one of our small molecule products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends existing patents and unexpired regulatory exclusivity for the product by an additional six months. While we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had, and could increasingly have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. State laws may also have an impact on our business. For example, California is the first state to have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against “pay for delay” settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement agreements are presumptively anticompetitive. The law may result in prolonged litigation and fewer settlements. Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Illinois and Minnesota, may adopt similar laws or a similar law could be adopted at the federal level.Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and accounts for approximately 90% of all EPOGEN sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. The three largest PBMs in the United States are now part of major health insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities has, and may continue to, put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competing products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. Further, if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor.RISKS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTWe may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&D.Amgen invests heavily in R&D. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&D projects yield approved and commercially viable products. Product candidates, including biosimilar product 39candidates, or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development have failed to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:•the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it achieved its primary endpoints and/or demonstrated positive preclinical or early clinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine or expectations of health authorities;•the product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available or potentially competitive therapies in treating a specified condition or illness;•the product candidate was not cost effective in light of existing or potentially competitive therapeutics;•the product candidate had harmful side effects in animals or humans;•the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve the product candidate for an intended use;•reimbursement for the product candidate is limited despite regulatory approval;•the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize;•other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all;•we and certain of our licensees, partners, contracted organizations or independent investigators failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; •the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not well-defined;•the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval; and•a companion diagnostic device that is required with the use of a product candidate is not approved by the necessary regulatory authority.We have spent considerable time, energy and resources developing our expertise in human genetics and acquiring access to libraries of genetic information with the belief that genetics could meaningfully aid our search for new medicines and help guide our R&D decisions and investments. We have focused our R&D strategy on drug targets validated by genetic or other compelling human evidence. However, product candidates based on genetically validated targets remain subject to the uncertainties of the drug development process and may not reach the market for a number of reasons, including the factors listed above.We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.Before a product may be sold, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels.Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened, and will continue to open, clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. 40Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. For other examples of the risks of conducting clinical trials in China, see also Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. Additionally, regional disruptions, including natural and man-made disasters or health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19), have significantly disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the timing of clinical trials. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and/or complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, or such sites experience disruptions as a result of a natural/man-made disaster or health emergency, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. For example, our clinical trials have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols, laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In some circumstances, we enter into co-development arrangements with other pharmaceutical and medical devices companies that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trials for the product we are co-developing or to develop a diagnostic test used in screening or monitoring patients in our clinical trials. See Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products. We also may acquire companies that have past or ongoing clinical trials or rights to products or product candidates for which clinical trials have been or are being conducted. These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or co-development partners, or the independent investigators or vendors selected by us, our co-development partners or by a company we have acquired or from which we have acquired rights to a product or product candidate, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could delay or otherwise negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. In addition, delays or failures to develop diagnostic tests for our clinical trials can affect the timely enrollment of such trials and lead to delays or inability to obtain marketing approval. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.In addition, some of our clinical trials utilize drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products’ or product candidates’ relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively affect the quality of their work product or create a shortage of supply, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively affected. As a result, such quality or supply problems could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide.Clinical trials must generally be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However, in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In some cases, we may design a clinical trial based on the standard of care we anticipate will exist at the time our study is completed. The duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer or that have not become the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. Additionally, the views of regulatory agencies relating to the requirements for accelerated approval may change over time, and trial designs that were sufficient to support accelerated approvals for some oncology products may not be considered sufficient for later candidates. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products and/or maintain our current product labels. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate clinical trial programs and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval.Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense, and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or 41the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in the other regions and countries in which we, or our partners and affiliates, sell to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture, market and sell our products. Once our products are approved, the FDA and other U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. The sanctions could include the FDA’s or ex-U.S. regulatory authorities’ refusals to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delays or suspensions of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspensions of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecutions.Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals have been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations, change existing laws or regulations or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets, and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets. We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as changes to laws or regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Further, we are reliant on regulators having the resources necessary to evaluate and approve our products. In the United States, a partial federal government shutdown halted the work of many federal agencies and their employees from late December 2018 through late January 2019. A subsequent extended shutdown could result in reductions or delays of FDA’s activities, including with respect to our ongoing clinical programs, our manufacturing of our products and product candidates and our product approvals.Regulatory authorities have questioned, and may in the future question, the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical benefit. For example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce or eliminate MRD, or to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening, measured by PFS. Demonstrating that the product candidate induces MRD-negative responses or produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive. In the CV setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDL-C levels, as an elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for CV events such as death, heart attack and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, despite demonstrating that Repatha reduced LDL-C levels in a broad patient population, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha to prevent CV events met certain of its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the FDA grant a broader approval of Repatha to reduce the risk of certain CV events. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion, or at all, has delayed, and may in the future delay, our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current product labels.Some of our products have been approved by U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, in March 2018, we announced that the FDA approved BLINCYTO under accelerated approval for the treatment of certain patients with B-cell precursor ALL. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the regulators’ requirements that were conditions of a product’s accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators reevaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in 42full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the product’s labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market.Regulatory authorities can also impose post-marketing pediatric study requirements. Failure to fulfill such requirements may result in regulatory or enforcement action, including financial penalties or the invalidation of a product’s marketing authorization.Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Postapproval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drug’s benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. The drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions. See Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product’s approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:•revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that has resulted, and may in the future result, in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate;•requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;•post-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;•product recalls of our approved products;•required changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products, which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing;•revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types;•increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or•treatments or product candidates not being approved by regulatory bodies.For example, after an imbalance in positively adjudicated CV serious adverse events was observed in one of the phase 3 clinical trials for EVENITY but not in another, larger phase 3 study, in April 2019 the FDA approved EVENITY for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, along with a post-marketing requirement. The requirement includes a five-year observational feasibility study that could be followed by a comparative safety study or trial.In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. In some markets, there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the BPCIA provided for such a pathway; while the FDA continues to develop regulatory and scientific policies for biosimilars, discussions continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways, or changes in existing regulatory pathways, including degradation of regulatory standards, could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have 43made in the biosimilars area. Further, we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the ACA or other legislation or policy initiatives would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure “first-to-market” or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.Many of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. For example, Neulasta is available as part of the Neulasta Onpro kit, and our AutoTouch reusable autoinjector is used with ENBREL Mini single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our products or product candidates, including many of our oncology product candidates and products, including LUMAKRAS, may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. In some regions, including the United States, regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product; in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if development or approval of such devices is delayed, such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance, or if such devices do not remain commercially available. When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies to supply and/or market the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements. Failure to successfully develop, modify, or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products. We are also required to collect and assess user complaints, adverse events and malfunctions regarding our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For example, in 2017, the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it was evaluating our Neulasta Onpro kit. Subsequently, we implemented device and labeling enhancements to address product complaints received on this device. We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related approved products.Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products.We depend on alliances with other companies, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, vendors and service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. For example, we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights, obligations and costs and/or commercial rights and obligations. See Item 1. Business—Business Relationships.Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to us or any disruption in the relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, our collaborative relationships for R&D and/or commercialization and sales often extend for many years and have given, and may in the future give, rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners, including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. 44Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions.We seek innovation through significant investment in both internal R&D and external transactions, including collaborations, partnering, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions (collectively, acquisition activity). Acquisition activities may be subject to regulatory approvals or other requirements that are not within our control. There can be no assurance that such regulatory or other approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions required in connection with our acquisition activities will be satisfied or waived, which could result in us being unable to complete the planned acquisition activities.Acquisition activities are complex, time consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may divert our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities and restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits of such transactions within the expected timeframe or at all. We may pay substantial amounts of cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities, which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders, respectively. Further, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses, products or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, manufacturing, distribution and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the benefits of the transaction and grow our business and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. These and other challenges may arise in connection with our acquisition of Otezla, Five Prime, Teneobio and/or our collaborations with BeiGene and KKC, or with other acquisition activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and stock price.RISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONSWe perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities, in particular those in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks, California. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.We currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing that supports our product candidates at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Thousand Oaks manufacturing facility could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our product candidates for use in our clinical trials, leading to delays in development of our product candidates.In addition, we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In recent years, Puerto Rico has been affected by natural disasters, including droughts in mid-2020, earthquakes in early 2020 and Hurricane Maria in 2017. These natural disasters have affected, and may continue to affect, public and private properties and Puerto Rico’s electric grid and communications networks in the future. While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters, the restoration of electrical service on the island after Hurricane Maria was a slow process, and our facility operated with electrical power from backup diesel powered generators for some time. We also operated on backup generators for a few weeks after the early 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico. In 2021, the baseload power generation units of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority malfunctioned due to the lack of adequate maintenance for over a decade. The problems experienced by these units, which are among the oldest in North America, have led to selective outages across the island. Further instability of the electric grid and unreliability on the generation units could require us to increase the use of our generators or to continue using them exclusively. In addition, future storms, earthquakes or other natural disasters or events could cause a more significant effect on our manufacturing operations. Puerto Rico and the rest of the world are facing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated health and economic implications. In March 2020, the Governor of Puerto Rico issued Executive Orders requiring the lockdown of businesses and government facilities, imposing restrictions on business operations and a curfew on residents. Our operations and employees were exempted from the lockdown and curfew, but we cannot predict whether the Governor will issue future Executive Orders imposing stricter lockdown and curfew measures should COVID-19 cases rise in Puerto Rico. Additionally, during the summer of 2021, a labor dispute arose between the maritime terminal operation company and its employees, represented by the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), which resulted in a strike that delayed cargo movement from the San Juan Port Zone for several days. Although our ability to manufacture and supply our products has not, 45to date, been significantly affected by these natural disasters, the unreliability of the electric service, the ILA strike or the COVID-19 pandemic, a combination of these challenges or other issues that could give rise to any substantial disruption to our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.Hurricane Maria, the earthquakes of early 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic have placed greater stress on the island’s already challenged economy. Beginning in 2016, the government of Puerto Rico defaulted on its roughly $72 billion in debt. In response, the U.S. Congress passed the PROMESA, which established the FOMBPR to provide fiscal oversight. Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including a stay of debtholder litigation. In 2017, the FOMBPR approved and certified the filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico of a voluntary petition under Title III of PROMESA for the government of Puerto Rico and certain of its governmental entities, including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which recently privatized its transmission and distribution infrastructure. After years of negotiations with bondholders and other creditors, the FOMBPR reached an agreement with the same and presented a Plan of Adjustment to the Title III Court. The Plan of Adjustment requires the Puerto Rico government to enact legislation authorizing the issuance of new bonds in exchange for older bonds and a reduction of the U.S. territory’s debt. On October 26, 2021, Act 53-2021, known as the “Law to End the Bankruptcy of Puerto Rico,” was enacted. From November to December 2021, the Court held several hearings regarding the approval of the Plan of Adjustment, and the Modified Eighth Plan of Adjustment was confirmed by the Court on January 18, 2022, to be effective on March 15, 2022. Each year since 2017, the FOMBPR has updated Puerto Rico’s fiscal plans implementing various measures intended to achieve fiscal responsibility and to restore Puerto Rico’s access to the capital markets, including significant expense reductions and suggested measures for economic growth. Each plan has stressed the need for fiscal and structural reforms to address Puerto Rico’s challenging economic and demographic trends. However, the government has not made significant progress during 2021 on the implementation of the fiscal and structural reforms required in the fiscal plan, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic.While the government and the FOMBPR have authorized emergency relief packages due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is uncertain how, or the degree to which, the pandemic will impact Puerto Rico’s fiscal and structural reforms and its economy. In addition, the 2017 Tax Act no longer permits deferral of U.S. taxation on Puerto Rico earnings, although these earnings generally will be taxed in the United States at a reduced rate. Given Puerto Rico’s challenged economy, disaster recovery needs and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be difficult for Puerto Rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base, which contributes significantly to Puerto Rico’s economy, due to competition from other locations subject to similar levels of taxation.While PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, Puerto Rico’s ongoing economic and demographic trend challenges and political situation, the effects of natural disasters, the unreliability of its electric system, the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the 2017 Tax Act or other potential tax law changes have negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, the territorial government’s provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business and could create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our products, on our business and on our product sales.We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, we rely on a single source for the SureClick autoinjectors used in the drug delivery of Repatha, ENBREL, Aimovig, AMGEVITA and Aranesp. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin.Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:•regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;•adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;•unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;46•failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall;•a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials;•discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components;•cyberattacks on supplier systems; and•labor disputes or shortages, including from the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19) and natural disasters.For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components have resulted in shortages, and in the future may lead to shortages, of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN glass vials). We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, clinical trial delays, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. These or other similar events could negatively affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.Manufacturing biologic and small molecule human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We manufacture many of our commercial products and product candidates internally. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. See Item 1. Business—Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials—Manufacturing. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products (and product candidates to support our clinical trials) is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be affected by:•capacity of manufacturing facilities;•contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;•natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;•labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19) or natural disasters;•compliance with regulatory requirements;•changes in forecasts of future demand;•timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields;•updates of manufacturing specifications;•contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers;•timing and outcome of product quality testing;•power failures and/or other utility failures;•cyberattacks on supplier systems;•breakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment (including our information technology systems and network-connected control systems or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers); and/or•delays in the ability of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to provide us necessary reviews, inspections and approvals, including as a result of a subsequent extended U.S. federal or other government shutdowns. If any of these or other problems affect production in one or more of our facilities or those of our third-party contract manufacturers, or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products or the amount of our product candidates required in 47clinical trials, we may be unable to start or increase production in our unaffected facilities to meet demand. If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. From time to time, we have initiated recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, in July 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot, and in April 2018 we initiated a precautionary recall of two batches of Vectibix distributed in Switzerland after potential crimping defects were discovered in the metal seals on some product vials. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Our manufacturing processes, those of our third-party contract manufacturers and those of certain of our third-party service providers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license another manufacturing plant, and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer or service provider. If we elect or are required to make changes to our manufacturing processes because of new regulatory requirements, new interpretations of existing requirements or other reasons, this could increase our manufacturing costs and result in delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends or contract negotiations or disputes. Such manufacturing challenges may also occur if our existing contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to timely implement such changes, or at all.In addition, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections of our manufacturing facilities and processes as well as those of our third-party contract manufacturers and service providers. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations, they may mandate corrective actions and/or issue warning letters, or even restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, prohibiting us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. See also Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis, or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, contract disputes, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct most of the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air and sea freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which may be negatively affected by natural disasters, security threats and/or the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.There have also been legislative and administrative proposals seeking to incentivize greater drug manufacturing in the United States with the stated goal of improving supply reliability in the United States. For example, on August 6, 2020, the previous Administration issued an Executive Order aimed at boosting domestic production of essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs titled “Executive Order on Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs are Made in the United States.” Additionally, one legislative proposal would prohibit the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from purchasing certain drugs that have active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured outside the United States. While we perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities in the United States, including in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California, the passage of such legislation could result in foreign governments enacting retaliatory legislation or regulatory actions, which may have an adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives.We continue to work towards operating our business in an environmentally responsible and socially inclusive manner. Stakeholders, including our investors and our employees, have increasingly focused on, and are expected to continue to focus 48on, our ESG practices. If our ESG practices fail to meet these stakeholders’ expectations and standards, there could be a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and, ultimately, our stock price.Our ESG report is made available on our website and describes our ESG goals and the progress we have made on the ESG issues deemed most important to our external and internal stakeholders, based on surveys, interviews and certain frameworks for corporate responsibility. Achieving our ESG goals requires long-term investments and broad, coordinated activity, and we may be required to incur additional costs or allocate additional resources towards monitoring, reporting and implementing our ESG practices. Further, we may fail to accurately assess our stakeholders’ ESG priorities, as such priorities have evolved and will continue to evolve. While we have achieved most of our goals set in prior years, whether we can achieve our current and future ESG goals continues to be uncertain and remains subject to numerous risks, including evolving regulatory requirements and social expectations affecting ESG practices, our ability to recruit, develop and retain a diverse workforce, the availability of suppliers and collaboration partners that can meet our ESG goals, the effects of the organic growth of our business and potential acquisitions of other businesses on our ESG performance, and the availability and cost of technologies or resources, such as carbon credits, that support our goals. Any failure or perceived failure to meet our ESG program priorities could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and stock price.The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations.Many of our operations and facilities, including those essential to our manufacturing, R&D and distribution activities, are in locations that are subject to natural disasters, including droughts, fires, hurricanes, tropical storms, and/or floods. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Maria caused catastrophic damage to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where we perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities. Although our site was well-protected and suffered minimal damage, there can be no assurances that we would have similar results in the face of future natural disasters. The severity and frequency of weather-related natural disasters has been amplified, and is expected to continue to be amplified by, global climate change. Such natural disasters have caused, and in the future may cause, damage to and/or disrupt our operations, which may result in a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Our suppliers, vendors and business partners also face similar risks, and any disruption to their operations could have an adverse effect on our supply and manufacturing chain. Further, many of our key facilities are located on islands, including Puerto Rico, Singapore and Ireland, which rely on essential port facilities that may be vulnerable to climate change-related or other natural disasters. Although we have detailed business continuity plans in place and periodic assessments of our natural disaster risk, any natural disaster may also result in prolonged interruption to our critical operational and business activities, and we may be required to incur significant costs to remedy the effects of such natural disasters and fully resume operations, which may result in a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. See We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials and Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.GENERAL RISK FACTORSGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. The economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global recession which may be of an extended duration. Additionally, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships (including inflation) may also affect patients’ ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. The current inflationary environment related to increased aggregate demand and supply chain constraints have also increased our operating expenses and may continue to affect our operating expenses. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors’, customers’ and suppliers’ financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. A significant worsening of global economic conditions could materially increase these risks we face.49We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets. The global spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. We have certain assets, including equity investments, that are exposed to market fluctuations that could, in a sustained or recurrent series of market disruptions, result in impairments. The value of our investments may also be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, inflation, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments.Our stock price is volatile.Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Announcements or discussions, including via social media channels, of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would negatively affect our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. Similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid effect on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially affected.We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. For example, early in 2020, there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper market and several borrowers were unable to obtain funding at normal rates or maturities, which resulted in a significant increase in draws of corporate credit lines with banks. Similarly, the bond markets experienced extreme volatility in terms of interest rates and credit spreads, with several days without new issuances of corporate bonds. We expect to access the capital markets, from time to time, to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we strategically plan to pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.Item 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.50Item 2.PROPERTIESAs of December 31, 2021, we owned or leased approximately 160 properties.

A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world’s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.Our principal products are ENBREL, Prolia, Otezla, XGEVA, Neulasta, Aranesp, Repatha, KYPROLIS and Nplate. We also market a number of other products, including MVASI, Vectibix, KANJINTI, EVENITY, EPOGEN, BLINCYTO, AMGEVITA, Aimovig, Parsabiv, NEUPOGEN, LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, Sensipar/Mimpara and TEZSPIRE. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.Our strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry. We focus on six commercial areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology, bone health, CV disease, nephrology and neuroscience. And we conduct discovery research primarily in three therapeutic areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology and general medicine. In 2021, we advanced our innovative pipeline, launched new products, completed several strategic transactions to augment our pipeline and research capabilities, and continued providing uninterrupted supplies of our medicines globally through the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We accomplished these objectives while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation and while advancing our ESG efforts.In 2021, we continued to advance our pipeline, including achieving key regulatory approvals for LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE. Our external business development activities for 2021 included: (i) acquiring Five Prime, including a later-stage gastric cancer bemarituzumab program; (ii) entering into a license agreement with KKC to develop a later-stage molecule for atopic dermatitis and other diseases; and (iii) acquiring Teneobio for its proprietary technologies and oncology programs in development. We also continued to advance our biosimilar program with the launch of RIABNI in the United States and introduced our other biosimilars into new markets. Our biosimilars are expected to continue launching in new markets throughout 2022.During 2021, while meeting the challenges of a global pandemic and facing increased competition from biosimilars and generics, total product sales were relatively flat as volume growth was offset by lower net selling prices. Product sales decreased 4% in the United States, driven by lower net selling prices, partially offset by volume growth, and increased 12% ROW, driven by volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling prices. Total operating expenses increased 13%, driven by IPR&D expense from the Five Prime acquisition and the upfront payment associated with the KKC licensing agreement.Cash flows from operating activities totaled $9.3 billion, which supported investment in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. For 2021, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.76 per share of common stock. In December 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $1.94 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2022. We also repurchased 21.7 million shares of our common stock during 2021 at an aggregate cost of $5.0 billion. In 2021, we issued $4.9 billion and repaid $4.2 billion of debt that was coming due in 2022.Amgen’s approach to, and investment in, human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating, developing and retaining talent to tackle the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines. Our compensation, benefits and development programs are designed to encourage performance, promote accountability and adherence to Company values, and align with the interests of the Company’s shareholders. Further, we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation, which supports our ability to serve patients. We are engaging in activities and setting goals to improve our focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging. For further information on these and other efforts, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Human Capital Resources.We have a long-standing ambition to be environmentally responsible, and we regularly set targets to challenge ourselves to deliver further improvements. In 2020, we met or exceeded our environmental sustainability targets set out in 2013 that called for reducing fleet carbon output by up to 20%, facility carbon output by 10%, water consumption by 10% and waste disposal by 35%.2 We achieved our 2020 targets while growing revenues, increasing production capacity and expanding to approximately 100 countries over the same 2013–20 period. To continue on our path to greater environmental sustainability, in January 2021 we announced a new set of long-term environmental targets to achieve by 2027, including achieving carbon neutrality, reducing water consumption by 40% and reducing waste disposed by 75%.2, 32 Represents reductions against established baselines, taking into account only verified reduction projects, and does not take into account changes associated with contraction or expansion of the Company.3 Carbon neutrality goal refers to Scope 1 and 2.55Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses from when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. Certain of our products face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents, and Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities, but successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We also face increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.Rising healthcare costs and uncertain economic conditions continue to pose challenges to our business, including increasing pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public and private healthcare-provider focus, the industry continues to be subject to cost containment measures and significant pricing pressures, including net price declines. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These buying patterns can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales but have generally not been significant to date when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products, and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain factors that could impact our future product sales.COVID-19 pandemicSince the onset of the pandemic in 2020, we have been closely monitoring the pandemic’s effects on our global operations. We continue to take appropriate steps to minimize risks to our employees, a significant number of whom have continued to work virtually. Employee access to company facilities has been in accordance with applicable government health and safety protocols and guidance issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, our remote working arrangements have not significantly affected our ability to maintain critical business operations, and we have not experienced disruptions to or shortages of our supply of medicines. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen changes in demand for some of our products driven by changes in the frequency of patient visits to doctors’ offices that has impacted the provision of treatments to existing patients and reduced diagnoses in new patients. During 2021, there was gradual recovery in both patient visits and diagnoses that approached pre-COVID-19 levels early in the fourth quarter. However late in 2021, the Omicron variant began to impact the healthcare sector and as a result we expect ongoing variability in demand patterns in the first half of 2022. The cumulative decrease in diagnoses over the course of the pandemic has suppressed the volume of new patients starting treatment, which we expect to continue to impact our business. We will continue to closely monitor the effects of emerging COVID-19 variants on patient behavior and access to care.Since early 2021, global vaccination efforts have been under way to control the pandemic. However, uncertainty remains as to the length of time required for vaccination of a meaningful portion of the population and as to the efficacy of such vaccinations with regard to the trajectory of the pandemic. Challenges to vaccination efforts, new variants and other causes of virus spread may require governments to issue additional restrictions and/or order shutdowns in various geographies. As a result, we expect to see continued volatility for at least the duration of the pandemic as governments respond to current local conditions.With respect to our drug development activities, we are continuously monitoring COVID-19 infection rates, including changes from new variants, and working to mitigate effects on future study enrollment in our clinical trials and evaluating the impacts in all countries where our clinical trials occur. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in their provision of care to patients and in our provision of investigational drug supply.Despite the ongoing pandemic and business impacts noted above, we believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements as well as to engage in capital-return and other business initiatives that we plan to pursue. For a discussion of the risks the COVID-19 pandemic presents to our results, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.56Selected Financial InformationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data):Year ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020Product sales:U.S.$17,286 (4)%$17,985 ROW7,011 12 %6,255 Total product sales24,297 — %24,240 Other revenues1,682 42 %1,184 Total revenues$25,979 2 %$25,424 Operating expenses$18,340 13 %$16,285 Operating income$7,639 (16)%$9,139 Net income$5,893 (19)%$7,264 Diluted EPS$10.28 (16)%$12.31 Diluted shares573 (3)%590 In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers (such as physicians or their clinics), dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held by wholesaler customers and end users (such as pharmacies).Total product sales were relatively flat for 2021, as volume growth was offset by declines in net selling prices. For 2022, we expect that net selling prices will continue to decline at a portfolio level driven by increased competition. Further, the first quarter of a year historically represents the lowest product sales quarter for the year, in part due to plan changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, particularly for products acquired through pharmacy benefit programs.Throughout the pandemic, we experienced changes in demand for some of our products. The pandemic has interrupted many physician–patient interactions, which has led to delays in diagnoses and treatments, with varying degrees of impact across our portfolio. In general, declines in the sales of our products that were impacted by the dynamics of the pandemic were most significant in the early months of the pandemic with product demand beginning to show some recovery in late 2020. During 2021, we observed gradual recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, with patient visits and diagnosis rates that approached pre-pandemic levels early in the fourth quarter. However, late in the year, the Omicron variant began to impact the healthcare sector and as a result, we have seen some shift back to virtual engagement by our field staff and variability in demand patterns. The cumulative decrease in diagnoses over the course of the pandemic has suppressed the volume of new patients starting treatment, which we expect to continue to impact our business. Given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, we expect there could be ongoing intermittent disruptions in physician–patient interactions, and as a result, we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variability. In addition, other changes in the healthcare ecosystem have the potential to introduce variability into product sales trends. For example, changes in U.S. employment have led to changes to the insured population. Growth in numbers of Medicaid enrollees and uninsured individuals may have a negative impact on product demand and sales. Overall, uncertainty remains around the timing and magnitude of our sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.Other revenues increased for 2021, primarily driven by the sale of COVID-19 antibody material resulting from our manufacturing collaboration.Operating expenses increased for 2021, driven by IPR&D expense related to the bemarituzumab program acquired as part of the Five Prime acquisition and by the upfront payment associated with the KKC licensing agreement.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2021, 2020 or 2019.57Results of OperationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019ENBREL$4,465 (11)%$4,996 (4)%$5,226 Prolia3,248 18 %2,763 3 %2,672 Otezla2,249 2 %2,195 *178 XGEVA2,018 6 %1,899 (2)%1,935 Neulasta1,734 (24)%2,293 (29)%3,221 Aranesp1,480 (6)%1,568 (9)%1,729 Repatha1,117 26 %887 34 %661 KYPROLIS1,108 4 %1,065 2 %1,044 Nplate1,027 21 %850 7 %795 Other products5,851 2 %5,724 21 %4,743 Total product sales$24,297 — %$24,240 9 %$22,204 Total U.S.$17,286 (4)%$17,985 9 %$16,531 Total ROW7,011 12 %6,255 10 %5,673 Total product sales$24,297 — %$24,240 9 %$22,204 * Change in excess of 100%.Future sales of our products will depend in part on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1.

For 2022, we expect ENBREL to follow the historical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles. In addition, for 2022, we expect net selling price to decline.The decrease in ENBREL sales for 2020 was driven by lower unit demand and net selling price, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and inventory.58Prolia Total Prolia sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019Prolia — U.S.$2,150 17 %$1,830 3 %$1,772 Prolia — ROW1,098 18 %933 4 %900 Total Prolia$3,248 18 %$2,763 3 %$2,672 The increase in global Prolia sales for 2021 was primarily driven by higher unit demand.The increase in global Prolia sales for 2020 was driven by higher unit demand and net selling price.OtezlaTotal Otezla sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019Otezla — U.S.$1,804 1 %$1,790 *$139 Otezla — ROW445 10 %405 *39 Total Otezla$2,249 2 %$2,195 *$178 * Change in excess of 100%.The increase in global Otezla sales for 2021 was driven by higher unit demand, partially offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to inventory. For 2022, we expect Otezla to follow the historical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles.Otezla was acquired on November 21, 2019, and generated $2.2 billion and $178 million in global sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.For a discussion of ongoing litigation related to Otezla, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.XGEVATotal XGEVA sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019XGEVA — U.S.$1,434 2 %$1,405 (4)%$1,457 XGEVA — ROW584 18 %494 3 %478 Total XGEVA$2,018 6 %$1,899 (2)%$1,935 The increase in global XGEVA sales for 2021 was primarily driven by higher unit demand, partially offset by lower net selling price.The decrease in global XGEVA sales for 2020 was driven by lower unit demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.59NeulastaTotal Neulasta sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019Neulasta — U.S.$1,514 (24)%$2,001 (29)%$2,814 Neulasta — ROW220 (25)%292 (28)%407 Total Neulasta$1,734 (24)%$2,293 (29)%$3,221 The decreases in global Neulasta sales for 2021 and 2020 was primarily driven by lower net selling price and unit demand. Increased competition as a result of biosimilar versions of Neulasta has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on brand sales, including accelerating net price erosion and lower unit demand. We also expect other biosimilar versions, including biosimilars that will use an on-body injector that would compete with our Onpro injector, to be approved in the future.For a discussion of ongoing patent litigations related to biosimilars, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.AranespTotal Aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019Aranesp — U.S.$537 (15)%$629 (17)%$758 Aranesp — ROW943 — %939 (3)%971 Total Aranesp$1,480 (6)%$1,568 (9)%$1,729 The decrease in global Aranesp sales for 2021 was primarily driven by lower net selling price due to competition.The decrease in global Aranesp sales for 2020 was driven by declines in net selling price and unit demand.Aranesp continues to face competition from a long-acting ESA and from a biosimilar version of EPOGEN, which will continue to impact sales in the future.RepathaTotal Repatha sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020ChangeYear ended December 31, 2019Repatha — U.S.$557 21 %$459 22 %$376 Repatha — ROW560 31 %428 50 %285 Total Repatha$1,117 26 %$887 34 %$661 The increases in global Repatha sales for 2021 and 2020 was driven by higher unit demand, partially offset by lower net selling price.

These categories are described below:CategoryDescriptionResearch and early pipeline R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process developmentLater-stage clinical programsR&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product primarily in the United States or the EUMarketed productsR&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold primarily in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained63R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions):Years ended December 31,202120202019Research and early pipeline$1,670 $1,405 $1,649 Later-stage clinical programs1,726 1,365 1,062 Marketed products1,423 1,437 1,405 Total R&D expense$4,819 $4,207 $4,116 The increase in R&D expense for 2021 was driven by a licensing-related expense from our collaboration with KKC included in later-stage clinical programs and higher spend in research and early pipeline, including other business development activities.The increase in R&D expense for 2020 was driven by higher spend for later-stage clinical programs, including LUMAKRAS, biosimilar programs and Otezla, and higher spend for Otezla included in marketed-product support. These increases were partially offset by recoveries from our collaboration with BeiGene that reduced expenses in later-stage clinical programs and in research and early pipeline, and lower spend in certain oncology programs included in research and early pipeline.Acquired in-process research and developmentAcquired IPR&D expense for 2021 was related to the bemarituzumab program acquired as part of the Five Prime acquisition.Selling, general and administrativeThe decrease in SG&A expense for 2021 was primarily driven by lower spend for marketed products and lower general and administrative expenses.The increase in SG&A expense for 2020 was driven by investments in certain marketed products, primarily Otezla, and preparation for product launches, partially offset by a reduction in conference-related expenses due to the impact of COVID-19.OtherOther operating expenses for 2021 primarily consisted of expenses related to cost-savings initiatives and a legal judgment.Other operating expenses for 2020 primarily consisted of legal settlement expenses.Other operating expenses for 2019 primarily consisted of expenses related to cost-savings initiatives.Nonoperating expenses/income and income taxesNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Years ended December 31,202120202019Interest expense, net$(1,197)$(1,262)$(1,289)Other income, net$259 $256 $753 Provision for income taxes$808 $869 $1,296 Effective tax rate12.1 %10.7 %14.2 %Interest expense, netThe decrease in Interest expense, net, for 2021 was primarily due to net higher costs associated with the early retirement of debt in 2020 and lower LIBOR rates in 2021 on debt for which we effectively pay a variable rate of interest through the use of interest rate swaps, partially offset by higher overall debt outstanding.The decrease in Interest expense, net, for 2020 was primarily due to lower LIBOR rates on debt for which we effectively pay a variable rate of interest, partially offset by net costs associated with the early retirement of debt.64Other income, netThe increase in Other income, net, for 2021 was primarily due to lower losses incurred in connection with our BeiGene investment compared with 2020, partially offset by lower income on our interest-bearing investments in 2021 and other nonrecurring gains recognized in 2020.The decrease in Other income, net, for 2020 was primarily due to reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash balances and a decline in interest yields and losses incurred in connection with our BeiGene investment, partially offset by gains recognized on our investments in publicly traded equity securities and limited partnerships. See Part IV—Note 9, Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Income taxesThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2021 compared with 2020 was primarily driven by the non-deductible IPR&D expense arising from the acquisition of Five Prime, partially offset by earnings mix and adjustments to prior-year tax liabilities.The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily driven by favorable items, including audit settlements, adjustments to prior-year tax liabilities, lower interest expense on uncertain tax positions and amortization related to the Otezla acquisition, partially offset by changes in valuation allowance.The Administration proposed and Congress is considering significant changes to existing tax law. These changes, if enacted, could substantially increase taxes we pay to the U.S. government. Further, the OECD recently reached agreement to align countries on a minimum corporate tax rate and an expansion of the taxing rights of market countries. If enacted, this agreement could result in tax increases in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Treasury recently released final foreign tax credit regulations that eliminate U.S. creditability of the Puerto Rico Excise Tax beginning in 2023, which will increase our U.S. tax liability. The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico is considering changes to its tax system that may minimize or eliminate this impact, but the outcome of such potential changes is uncertain. Changes to existing tax law in the United States, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, or other jurisdictions, including the potential changes discussed above, could result in tax increases where we do business and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. In 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Notices for 2010, 2011 and 2012 that we received in May and July 2021 which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income. The Notices seek to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $3.6 billion plus interest. Any additional tax that could be imposed would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings. We firmly believe that the IRS’s positions set forth in the Notices are without merit, and we are contesting the Notices through the judicial process. In 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office. We were unable to reach resolution at the administrative appeals level, and we anticipate that we will receive a statutory notice of deficiency for these years as well. We expect to contest any such notice related to 2013–15 through the judicial process. We are also currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 and by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions. Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and the uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability; Part II, Item 7. MD&A—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Income taxes; and Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.65Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions):December 31,20212020Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$8,037 $10,647 Total assets$61,165 $62,948 Current portion of long-term debt$87 $91 Long-term debt$33,222 $32,895 Stockholders’ equity$6,700 $9,409 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesOur balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $8.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Capital allocationConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we deploy our accumulated cash balances in a strategic manner and consider a number of alternatives, including strategic transactions (including those that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest), repayment of debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We intend to continue investing in our business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases, thereby reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business and our desire to optimize our cost of capital. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company’s agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by our overall level of cash, stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include block purchases, tender offers, accelerated share repurchases and market transactions.The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.76, $1.60 and $1.45 per share of common stock paid in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of 10% over the prior year in both 2021 and 2020. In December 2021, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.94 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2022.We also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2021, we repurchased and had cash settlements of $5.0 billion of common stock. In 2020, we repurchased and had cash settlements of $3.5 billion of common stock. In 2019, we repurchased $7.6 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $7.7 billion. In March 2021, October 2021 and December 2021, the Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by $3.4 billion, $4.5 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, $10.9 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.As a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our accumulated deficit is not anticipated to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our expected continued profitability and strong financial position.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock, and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities, and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.66Financing arrangementsTo help meet our liquidity requirements, we have entered into various financing arrangements. The noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, were $33.2 billion and $32.9 billion, respectively. The carrying values of our long-term borrowings are net of fair value adjustments for interest rate swaps and unamortized discounts, premiums and offering costs. As of December 31, 2021, S&P, Moody’s and Fitch assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A– with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB+ with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings.During 2021 and 2020, we issued debt with aggregate principal amounts of $5.0 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively. During 2019, we did not issue any debt or debt securities. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we repaid/redeemed debt of $4.2 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. In addition, during 2020, we exchanged $0.7 billion of certain of our outstanding note issuances with $0.9 billion of newly issued notes with a lower interest rate and later maturity date.To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating, LIBOR-based coupon over the lives of the respective notes. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $6.7 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively.To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively.As of December 31, 2021, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.In 2019, we amended and restated our $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement, which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $750 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest for any amounts borrowed under this facility, based on our current credit rating, at (i) LIBOR plus 1% or (ii) the highest of (A) the syndication agent bank base commercial lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1%. The agreement contains provisions related to the determination of successor rates to address the possible phaseout or unavailability of designated reference rates. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.It is anticipated that the U.S. dollar LIBOR rate will be phased out and replaced by 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of private-market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help ensure a successful transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR to a more robust reference rate, recommends SOFR as the U.S. dollar LIBOR alternative. As such, we expect SOFR to become widely adopted by market participants. We do not expect this change to have a material impact on our financial statements. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.In February 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2023.Certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2021. These financing arrangements are more fully discussed in Part IV—Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.67Cash flowsOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions):Years ended December 31,202120202019Net cash provided by operating activities$9,261 $10,497 $9,150 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$733 $(5,401)$5,709 Net cash used in financing activities$(8,271)$(4,867)$(15,767)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2021 primarily due to the monetization of interest rate swaps that occurred in 2020 and the timing of payments for sales incentives and discounts. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2020 primarily due to higher Net income after adding back the noncash amortization related to the acquisition of Otezla, the monetization of interest rate swap contracts and working-capital adjustments.InvestingCash provided by investing activities during 2021 was primarily due to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $4.3 billion, partially offset by cash used in the acquisitions of Teneobio and Five Prime of $2.5 billion. Cash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily due to our $3.2 billion of purchases of equity method investments, primarily BeiGene, and net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $1.5 billion. Cash provided by investing activities during 2019 was primarily due to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $20.0 billion which occurred primarily to fund our acquisition of Otezla and investment in BeiGene. Capital expenditures were $880 million, $608 million and $618 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We currently estimate 2022 spending on capital projects to be approximately $950 million. A majority of the increase in expenditures relates to expansion of manufacturing capacity to enable supply of products and product candidates.FinancingCash used in financing activities during 2021 was primarily due to payments to repurchase our common stock of $5.0 billion and the payment of dividends of $4.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments of $0.8 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2020 was primarily due to the payment of dividends of $3.8 billion and payments to repurchase our common stock of $3.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments of $2.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2019 was primarily due to payments to repurchase our common stock of $7.7 billion, repayment of debt of $4.5 billion and payments of dividends of $3.5 billion.See Part IV—Note 9, Investments; Note 15, Financing arrangements; and Note 16, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Capital requirementsWe have material cash requirements to pay third parties under various contractual obligations discussed below.We are obligated to pay interest and repay principal under our various financing arrangements, including amounts under interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts related to certain of our long-term debt obligations. For information on scheduled debt maturities and payments under derivative contracts associated with our long-term debt obligations, see Part IV—Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We are obligated to make payments for operating leases, including rental commitments on abandoned leases and leases that have not yet commenced. For information on these obligations, see Part IV—Note 13, Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Under the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay in eight annual installments the repatriation tax related primarily to prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations. For information on the remaining scheduled repatriation tax installments, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments—Commitments—U.S. Repatriation tax, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.68We have purchase obligations of $3.2 billion primarily related to (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Most of these obligations are expected to be paid within one year, and payment of certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. In addition to the purchase obligations noted above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts that in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of Teneobio and K-A. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring, and any resulting cash requirements are managed through our operational budgeting processes. Except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration of approximately $0.3 billion, these obligations are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $7.4 billion, including $1.6 billion of contingent consideration payments in connection with our Teneobio acquisition.We have recorded liabilities for UTBs that, because of their nature, have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payment and other events that extinguish these liabilities. See Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are included in Part IV—Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies. The following are considered critical to our consolidated financial statements because they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.Product sales and sales deductionsRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions):RebatesChargebacksOther deductionsTotalBalance as of December 31, 2018$2,589 $454 $127 $3,170 Amounts charged against product sales6,825 7,090 1,292 15,207 Payments(6,249)(6,985)(1,263)(14,497)Balance as of December 31, 20193,165 559 156 3,880 Amounts charged against product sales9,167 8,223 1,818 19,208 Payments(8,353)(8,191)(1,735)(18,279)Balance as of December 31, 20203,979 591 239 4,809 Amounts charged against product sales10,195 9,619 2,065 21,879 Payments(10,027)(9,413)(2,074)(21,514)Balance as of December 31, 2021$4,147 $797 $230 $5,174 For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, total sales deductions were 47%, 44% and 41% of gross product sales, respectively. The increase in the total sales deductions balance as of December 31, 2021, compared with December 31, 2020, was primarily driven by the impact of higher U.S. chargeback and commercial rebate discount rates and an increase in gross sales, partially offset by timing of payments. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. 69In the United States, we use wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold.Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements that vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels; and we accrue these rebates in the period the related sales are recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results because chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.Product returnsReturns are estimated by comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.Income taxesWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, when appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.Certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements, and they cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as tax deductions or credits in tax returns in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and the tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, because future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.70We are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. In the jurisdictions where we conduct operations, we are subject to income tax based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and on the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035.In 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Notices for 2010, 2011 and 2012 that we received in May and July 2021, which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income. The Notices seek to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $3.6 billion plus interest. Any additional tax that could be imposed would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings. We firmly believe that the IRS’s positions set forth in the Notices are without merit, and we are contesting the Notices through the judicial process. In 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and that are similar to those proposed for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office. We were unable to reach resolution at the administrative appeals level, and we anticipate that we will receive a statutory notice of deficiency for these years as well. We expect to contest any such notice related to 2013–15 through the judicial process. We are also currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 and by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions. Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability; Part II, Item 7. MD&A—Income Taxes; and Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes and class action suits that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.71Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitionsWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in an acquisition. See Part IV—Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to:•determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;•projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;•estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and•developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the business combination date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included but were not limited to the timing and probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.Impairment of long-lived assetsWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared with the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value.Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination that have not reached technological feasibility or that lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference, and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.72Impairment of equity method investmentsWe review the carrying value of our equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an investment may not be recoverable. We record impairment losses on our equity method investments if we deem the impairment to be other-than-temporary. We deem an impairment to be other-than-temporary based on various factors, including but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value is below the carrying value, volatility of the security price, the financial condition of the issuer, changes in technology that may impair the earnings potential of the investment and our intent and ability to retain the investment to allow for a recovery in fair value. We believe our judgments used in assessing impairment of equity method investments are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Part IV—Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2021.Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.In the discussion that follows, we assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Except as noted below, we also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.Interest-rate-sensitive financial instrumentsOur portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, was composed almost entirely of U.S. Treasury securities and money market mutual funds. The fair values of our available-for-sale investments were $7.3 billion and $9.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, would not have resulted in a material reduction in the fair values of these securities. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year.As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.3 billion and a fair value of $37.9 billion. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.0 billion and a fair value of $39.4 billion. Our outstanding debt was composed of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, would have resulted in an increase of $4.5 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on both of these dates. Analysis of the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below.To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective notes. Interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $6.7 billion and $5.9 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $330 million and $230 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates. Analysis of the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest-rate-sensitive instruments were designed to offset. 73As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, that hedge our foreign-currency-denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $170 million and $250 million, respectively.Foreign-currency-sensitive financial instrumentsOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared with foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward and cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $3.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $4.8 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $710 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $640 million. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.1 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.0 billion. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the related foreign-currency-denominated debt.We have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs, with aggregate notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $700 million and $1.1 billion on these dates, respectively. The impact of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates on ensuing years’ income from these contracts would be fully offset by corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2021, the fair values of these contracts were a $183 million asset and a $39 million liability. As of December 31, 2020, the fair values of these contracts were a $28 million asset and a $237 million liability. As of December 31, 2021, we had primarily euro-based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.7 billion. As of December 31, 2020, we had primarily euro-based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.1 billion. With regard to foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $1.1 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $390 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $1.1 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $420 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had open, short-duration, foreign currency forward contracts that mature in one month or less, that had notional amounts of $0.7 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, and that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, a hypothetical 5% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.74Market-price-sensitive financial instrumentsAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we were exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments include publicly and privately held small-capitalization stocks, limited partnerships that invest in early-stage biotechnology companies and our investment in BeiGene. A 20% decrease in the aggregate value of our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, would result in losses in fair value of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.Counterparty credit risksOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk, which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring that transactions be made only with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A– or equivalent by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch; and it places exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.",2023-12-30 18:04:45.994841
318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2023,"em 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations, Income Taxes, and Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. The 2017 Tax Act is complex and a large volume of regulations and guidance has been issued and could be subject to different interpretations. We could face audit challenges to our application of the 2017 Tax Act. In addition, there are several upcoming provisions in the 2017 Tax Act, including increases in the tax rates on foreign earnings and export income scheduled to take effect at the end of 2025, that could result in an increase in our effective tax rate. The Administration and Congress continue to discuss changes to existing tax law that could substantially increase the taxes we pay in the United States. Further, the OECD reached an agreement to align countries on a minimum corporate tax rate and an expansion of the taxing rights of market countries. Some individual countries, including those in the EU, have proposed 36legislation to implement the global minimum tax agreement. In other countries such as the United States, however, the implementation of the OECD agreement remains highly uncertain. If enacted, either by all OECD participants or unilaterally by individual countries, the agreement could result in tax increases or double taxation that could affect our United States or foreign tax liabilities. Changes to existing tax law in the United States, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico or other jurisdictions, including the changes and potential changes discussed above, could result in tax increases where we do business and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time consuming and distracting, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management’s attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products.We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the United States and around the world. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar antibribery or anticorruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We cannot ensure that all our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. On April 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations relating to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines. As a result, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement, failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and potential exclusion from government healthcare programs. We may also see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. For example, prosecutors are placing greater scrutiny on patient support programs, including commercial copay assistance programs, and further enforcement actions and investigations regarding such programs could limit our ability to provide co-pay assistance to commercial patients. Greater scrutiny has also been placed on sponsorships, speaker programs and other arrangements where healthcare professionals receive remuneration, travel or other value to participate in certain events, and further enforcement actions could limit our ability to participate in such arrangements. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO COMPETITIONOur products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition.We operate in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. We expect that our products and product candidates will compete with existing drugs, new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products have expanded into, and are expected to continue expanding into, the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. With the proliferation of companies pursuing biopharmaceuticals, several of our biosimilar products have entered, and a number of our product candidates may enter, markets with one or more competitors or with competitors soon to arrive. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market. As a result, our products have been competing and may continue to compete, and our product candidates may compete, against products or product candidates that offer higher rebates or discounts, lower prices, equivalent or superior efficacy, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive 37features. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce our sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Driven by cost pressures, efforts to limit or weaken patent protection for our industry are increasing. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased interest in compulsory licenses, march-in rights or other governmental interventions, both in the United States and internationally, related to the procurement of drugs, and the World Trade Organization has agreed to a waiver of COVID-19 vaccine intellectual property protections through the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights waiver process. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Third parties have challenged and may continue to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentially-infringing product. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, are currently and expect to be in the future, involved in patent litigation. These matters have included, and may in the future include, litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the BPCIA. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation has not discouraged, and may not in the future discourage, a potential violator from bringing the allegedly infringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the losses, damages and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.Further, under the Hatch–Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the five-year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the 12-year exclusivity period provided under the BPCIA. In addition, we have faced, and may in the future face, patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies, including those that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products or who are developing or have developed other biosimilar versions of such products. Alternatively, patents held by other entities have contributed, and may in the future contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all of the same labeled indications as are held by these companies. While we have attempted, and expect to continue to attempt, to challenge the patents held by other companies, our efforts may be unsuccessful. For examples of and information related to our patent litigation, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Certain of the existing patents on our products have expired or will soon expire. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents. As our patents expire, competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, competitors have been, and may continue to be, able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products.38We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics in most of the territories in which we operate, including the United States and Europe, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar and/or generics competition this year and beyond. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights or expiration of an applicable exclusivity period has accelerated such competition, and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products have also experienced greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive regulatory approval standards and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics, the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate.In the EU, biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some EU countries and some Canadian provinces have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, biosimilar uptake measures such as physician prescribing quotas or automatic pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. Some EU countries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors. In September 2022, the EMA and the EU Heads of Medicines’ Agencies (HMA) issued a joint statement providing that biosimilar medicines approved in the EU are “interchangeable” with their reference products and other biosimilars of the same reference product. This EMA-HMA statement could further contribute to the prescribing of biosimilars and to greater competition in Europe. While the degree of competitive effects of biosimilar competition differs between EU countries and between products, in the EU the overall use of biosimilars and the rate at which product sales of innovative products are being affected by biosimilar competition is increasing.In the United States, the BPCIA authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. See Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Approval of Biosimilars. In the United States, the FDA has approved numerous biosimilars, including biosimilar versions of Neulasta, EPOGEN and ENBREL, and a growing number of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products. For example, six biosimilar versions of Neulasta are now approved in the United States, and we expect that other biosimilar versions of Neulasta may be marketed or receive approval in the future. Impact to our Neulasta sales has accelerated as additional competitors have launched. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. Manufacturers of biosimilars have attempted, and may in the future attempt, to compete with our products by offering lower list prices, greater discounts or rebates, or contracts that offer longer-term pricing or a broader portfolio of other products. Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For examples of and information related to our biosimilars and generics patent litigation, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.The U.S. biosimilar pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to obtain interchangeable status from the FDA, which could potentially allow pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our reference products without prior approval from the prescriber in most states under state law. The FDA approved the first interchangeable biosimilar in 2021 and has subsequently granted interchangeability designations to three additional biosimilars. In 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance that provides that comparative immunogenicity studies will not generally be expected for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. This has opened the door for other product-specific guidance development and the removal of the expectation for certain studies, which may contribute to increased biosimilar competition for our innovative products. For example, in August 2022, the FDA designated a monoclonal antibody biosimilar as interchangeable without requiring a switching study to support the interchangeability determination. Further, in September 2022, the FDA indicated that while comparative clinical trials will continue to be a requirement for many biosimilar development programs, the agency is focused on reducing the need for them in the future through a range of statistical, analytical and pharmacologic approaches.In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law’s provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. In 2019, the Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products. Also, the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product’s original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as “umbrella exclusivity”). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period, 39this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and commercialization, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars and pass new laws requiring more disclosure in the FDA’s Orange and Purple Books. For example, in 2021 the FDA sent a letter to the USPTO describing ways to strengthen coordination between the two agencies, offered training to help identify prior art, and seeking USPTO’s views on practices that extend market exclusivities, whether pharmaceutical patent examiners need additional resources, and the effect of post-grant challenges at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board on drug patents. The USPTO responded in July 2022 with a letter to the FDA stating that it is prepared to create formal mechanisms to collaborate with the FDA on patent issues that may affect the timing of generic and biosimilar entry. In January 2023, the USPTO held a joint listening session with the FDA on USPTO-FDA collaboration efforts.Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. Additionally, if one of our products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends unexpired regulatory exclusivity for the product (and existing patents for a small molecule product) by an additional six months. While we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had, and could increasingly have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. State laws may also have an impact on our business. For example, California is the first state to have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against “pay for delay” settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement agreements are presumptively anticompetitive. The law may result in prolonged litigation and fewer settlements. Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Illinois and Minnesota, may adopt similar laws or a similar law could be adopted at the federal level.Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. The three largest PBMs in the United States are now part of major health insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities has, and may continue to, put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competing products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. Further, if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor.40RISKS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTWe may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&D.Amgen invests heavily in R&D. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&D projects yield approved and commercially viable products. Product candidates, including biosimilar product candidates, or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development have failed to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:•the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it achieved its primary endpoints and/or demonstrated positive preclinical or early clinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine or expectations of health authorities;•the product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available or potentially competitive therapies in treating a specified condition or illness;•the product candidate was not cost effective in light of existing or potentially competitive therapeutics;•the product candidate had harmful side effects in animals or humans;•the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve the product candidate for an intended use;•reimbursement for the product candidate is limited despite regulatory approval;•the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize;•other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all;•we and certain of our licensees, partners, contracted organizations or independent investigators failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; •the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not well-defined;•the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval; and•a companion diagnostic device that is required with the use of a product candidate is not approved by the necessary regulatory authority.We have spent considerable time, energy and resources developing our expertise in human genetics and acquiring access to libraries of genetic information with the belief that genetics could meaningfully aid our search for new medicines and help guide our R&D decisions and investments. We have focused our R&D strategy on drug targets validated by genetic or other compelling human evidence. However, product candidates based on genetically validated targets remain subject to the uncertainties of the drug development process and may not reach the market for a number of reasons, including the factors listed above.We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.Before a product may be sold, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and/or patients to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. Delays and complications in 41planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels.Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened, and will continue to open, clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. For other examples of the risks of conducting clinical trials in China, see also Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. Additionally, regional disruptions, including natural and man-made disasters, health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19), or geopolitical conflicts (such as the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine) have significantly disrupted the timing of clinical trials, and in the future could disrupt the timing, execution and outcome of clinical trials. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, or such sites experience disruptions as a result of a natural/man-made disaster, health emergency or geopolitical conflict, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. For example, our clinical trials have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols, laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In some circumstances, we enter into co-development arrangements with other pharmaceutical and medical devices companies that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trials for the product we are co-developing or to develop a diagnostic test used in screening or monitoring patients in our clinical trials. See Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sales of our products. We also may acquire companies that have past or ongoing clinical trials or rights to products or product candidates for which clinical trials have been or are being conducted. These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or co-development partners, or the independent investigators or vendors selected by us, our co-development partners or by a company we have acquired or from which we have acquired rights to a product or product candidate, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could delay or otherwise negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. In addition, delays or failures to develop diagnostic tests for our clinical trials can affect the timely enrollment of such trials and lead to delays or inability to obtain marketing approval. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.In addition, some of our clinical trials utilize drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products’ or product candidates’ relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively affect the quality of their work product or create a shortage of supply, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively affected. As a result, such quality or supply problems could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide.Clinical trials must generally be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However, in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In some cases, we may design a clinical trial based on the standard of care we anticipate will exist at the time our study is completed. The duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer or that have not become the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. Additionally, the views of regulatory agencies relating to the requirements for accelerated approval may change over time, and trial designs that were sufficient to support accelerated approvals for some oncology products may not be considered sufficient 42for later candidates. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products and/or maintain our current product labels. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate clinical trial programs and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval.Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense, and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in the other regions and countries in which we, or our partners and affiliates, sell to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture, market and sell our products. Once our products are approved, the FDA and other U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. The sanctions could include the FDA’s or ex-U.S. regulatory authorities’ refusals to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delays or suspensions of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspensions of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecutions.Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals have been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations, change existing laws or regulations or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets, and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets. We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as changes to laws or regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Further, we are reliant on regulators having the resources necessary to evaluate and approve our products. In the United States, a partial federal government shutdown halted the work of many federal agencies and their employees from late December 2018 through late January 2019. A subsequent extended shutdown could result in reductions or delays of FDA’s activities, including with respect to our ongoing clinical programs, our manufacturing of our products and product candidates and our product approvals.Regulatory authorities have questioned, and may in the future question, the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical benefit. For example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce or eliminate minimal residual disease (MRD), or to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening, measured by PFS. Demonstrating that the product candidate induces MRD-negative responses or produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive. In the CV setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDL-C levels, as an elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for CV events such as death, heart attack and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, despite demonstrating that Repatha reduced LDL-C levels in a broad patient population, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha to prevent CV events met certain of its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the FDA grant a broader approval of Repatha to reduce the risk of certain CV events. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion, or at all, has delayed, and may in the future delay, our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current product labels.43Some of our products have been approved by U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, in May 2021, we announced that the FDA approved LUMAKRAS under accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated local advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials, including a requirement by the FDA that we complete a post-marketing trial to investigate whether a lower dose will have a similar clinical effect to the results demonstrated in our pre-marketing trial. We have since received the data from such post-marketing trial and intend to submit it to the FDA, as required. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the regulators’ requirements that were conditions of a product’s accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators reevaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the product’s labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market.Regulatory authorities can also impose post-marketing pediatric study requirements. Failure to fulfill such requirements may result in regulatory or enforcement action, including financial penalties or the invalidation of a product’s marketing authorization.Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Postapproval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to help ensure that a drug’s benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. The drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions. See Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product’s approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:•revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that has resulted, and may in the future result, in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate;•requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;•post-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;•product recalls of our approved products;•required changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products, which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing;•revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types;•increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or•treatments or product candidates not being approved by regulatory bodies.For example, after an imbalance in positively adjudicated CV serious adverse events was observed in one of the phase 3 clinical trials for EVENITY but not in another, larger phase 3 study, in April 2019 the FDA approved EVENITY for the 44treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, along with a post-marketing requirement. The requirement includes a five-year observational feasibility study that could be followed by a comparative safety study or trial.In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. In some markets, there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the BPCIA provided for such a pathway. Discussions within the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and between regulatory authorities and sponsors, continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways, or changes in existing regulatory pathways, including degradation of regulatory standards, could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Further, we cannot predict the extent to which any potential legislative or policy initiatives would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure “first-to-market” or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.Many of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. For example, Neulasta is available as part of the Neulasta Onpro kit, and our AutoTouch reusable autoinjector is used with ENBREL Mini single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our products or product candidates, including many of our oncology product candidates and products, including LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS and bemarituzumab, may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. In some regions, including the United States, regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product; in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if development or approval of such devices is delayed, such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance, or if such devices do not remain commercially available. When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies to supply and/or market the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements. Failure to successfully develop, modify, or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products. We are also required to collect and assess user complaints, adverse events and malfunctions regarding our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For example, in 2017, the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it was evaluating our Neulasta Onpro kit. Subsequently, we implemented device and labeling enhancements to address product complaints received on this device. We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related approved products.Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sales of our products.We depend on alliances with other companies, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, vendors and service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. For example, we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights, obligations and costs and/or commercial rights and obligations. See Item 1. Business—Business Relationships.45Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to us or any disruption in the relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, our collaborative relationships for R&D and/or commercialization and sales often extend for many years and have given, and may in the future give, rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners, including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions.We seek innovation through significant investment in both internal R&D and external transactions, including collaborations, partnerships, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions (collectively, acquisition activity). Acquisition activities may be subject to regulatory approvals or other requirements that are not within our control. There can be no assurance that such regulatory or other approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions required in connection with our acquisition activities will be satisfied or waived, which could result in us being unable to complete the planned acquisition activities. In addition, antitrust scrutiny by regulatory agencies and changes to regulatory approval process in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may cause approvals to take longer than anticipated to obtain, not be obtained at all, or contain burdensome conditions, which may jeopardize, delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of acquisitions to us and could impede the execution of our business strategy.Acquisition activities are complex, time consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may divert our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities and restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits of such transactions within the expected timeframe or at all. We may pay substantial amounts of cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities, which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders, respectively. Further, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses, products or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, manufacturing, distribution and general business operations and procedures and ESG activities) may affect our ability to realize the benefits of the transaction and grow our business and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. These and other challenges may arise in connection with our acquisitions of Otezla, Five Prime, Teneobio, ChemoCentryx, Horizon and/or our collaborations with BeiGene and KKC, or with other acquisition activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and stock price.RISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONSWe perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities, in particular those in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks, California. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.We currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing that supports our product candidates at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Thousand Oaks manufacturing facility could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our product candidates for use in our clinical trials, leading to delays in development of our product candidates.In addition, we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In recent years, Puerto Rico has been affected by a number of natural disasters, including Hurricane Maria (2017), earthquakes (2020) and Hurricane Fiona (2022). These natural disasters have affected, and may continue to affect, public and private properties and Puerto Rico’s electric grid and communications networks. While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters, the restoration of electrical service on the island after Hurricane Maria was a slow process, and our facility relied on backup diesel powered generators for some time. We also operated on backup generators for a few weeks after the early 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico. In 2021, the baseload power generation units of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority malfunctioned due to the 46lack of adequate maintenance for over a decade, leading to selective outages across the island. In September 2022, Hurricane Fiona caused further damage to the island’s utility infrastructure which again resulted in widespread power outages and water supply issues. Although these events did not directly have a material effect on our business, they have resulted in disruptions to our third-party suppliers on the island. Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase our use of our generators or to use them exclusively. In addition, future storms, earthquakes or other natural or man-made disasters or events (including political unrest or labor shortages) could have a more significant effect on our manufacturing operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in disruptions to activities on the island. In March 2020, the Governor of Puerto Rico issued Executive Orders requiring the lockdown of businesses and government facilities, imposing restrictions on business operations and a curfew on residents in response to COVID-19. Additionally, during the summer of 2021, a labor dispute arose between the maritime terminal operation company and its employees, represented by the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), which resulted in a strike that delayed cargo movement from the San Juan Port Zone for several days. Hurricanes Maria and Fiona, the 2020 earthquakes, the COVID-19 pandemic and the ILA strike have also placed greater stress on the island’s already challenged economy. Beginning in 2016, the government of Puerto Rico defaulted on its roughly $72 billion of debt. In response, the U.S. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, which established a financial oversight board for Puerto Rico. After years of negotiations with bondholders and other creditors, this financial oversight board reached an agreement with the same, which was confirmed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico effective March 2022. Although our ability to manufacture and supply our products has not, to date, been significantly affected by natural disasters, unreliable electric utility services, strikes, pandemic lockdowns or the island’s economic challenges, these, or a combination of these challenges, or other issues that create a substantial disruption to our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location, could make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico, and could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, we rely on a single source for the SureClick autoinjectors used in the drug delivery of Repatha, ENBREL, Aimovig, AMGEVITA and Aranesp. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin.Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:•regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;•adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;•unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;•failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall;•a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials;•discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components;•cyberattacks on supplier systems; •natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires; •labor disputes or shortages, including from the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19) or natural disasters; and•geopolitical conflicts.For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility, and we have also experienced shortages related to single use systems and packaging which has caused disruptions to our manufacturing plans. Further quality issues that result in 47unexpected additional demand for certain components have resulted in shortages and in the future may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN glass vials). We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, clinical trial delays, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. These or other similar events could negatively affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.Manufacturing biologic and small molecule human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We manufacture many of our commercial products and product candidates internally. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. See Item 1. Business—Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials—Manufacturing. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products (and product candidates to support our clinical trials) is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be affected by:•capacity of manufacturing facilities;•contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;•natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;•labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19) or natural disasters;•compliance with regulatory requirements;•changes in forecasts of future demand;•timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields;•updates of manufacturing specifications;•contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers;•timing and outcome of product quality testing;•power failures and/or other utility failures;•cyberattacks on supplier systems;•breakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment (including our information technology systems and network-connected control systems or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers); •delays in the ability of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to provide us necessary reviews, inspections and approvals, including as a result of a subsequent extended U.S. federal or other government shutdowns; and/or•geopolitical conflicts. If any of these or other problems affect production in one or more of our facilities or those of our third-party contract manufacturers, or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products or the amount of our product candidates required in clinical trials, we may be unable to start or increase production in our unaffected facilities to meet demand. If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. From time to time, we have initiated recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, in July 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot, and in April 2018 we initiated a precautionary recall of two batches of Vectibix distributed in Switzerland after potential crimping defects were discovered in the metal seals on some product vials. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.48Our manufacturing processes, those of our third-party contract manufacturers and those of certain of our third-party service providers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license another manufacturing plant, and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer or service provider. If we elect or are required to make changes to our manufacturing processes because of new regulatory requirements, new interpretations of existing requirements or other reasons, this could increase our manufacturing costs and result in delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends or contract negotiations or disputes. Such manufacturing challenges may also occur if our existing contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to timely implement such changes, or at all.In addition, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections of our manufacturing facilities and processes as well as those of our third-party contract manufacturers and service providers. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations, they may mandate corrective actions and/or issue warning letters, or even restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, prohibiting us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. See also Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis, or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, contract disputes, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct most of the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air and sea freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which has been negatively affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and may be negatively affected by natural disasters or geopolitical security threats.There have also been legislative and administrative proposals seeking to incentivize greater drug manufacturing in the United States with the stated goal of improving supply reliability in the United States. For example, on August 6, 2020, the previous Administration issued an Executive Order aimed at boosting domestic production of essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs titled “Executive Order on Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs are Made in the United States.” Additionally, one legislative proposal would have prohibited the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from purchasing certain drugs that have active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured outside the United States. While we perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities in the United States, including in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California, the passage of such legislation could result in foreign governments enacting retaliatory legislation or regulatory actions, which may have an adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives.We continue to work towards operating our business in an environmentally responsible and socially inclusive manner. Stakeholders, including our investors and our employees, have increasingly focused on, and are expected to continue to focus on, our ESG practices. If our ESG practices fail to meet these stakeholders’ expectations and standards, there could be a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and, ultimately, our stock price.Our ESG report is made available on our website and describes our ESG goals and the progress we have made on the ESG issues deemed most important to our external and internal stakeholders, based on surveys, interviews and certain frameworks for corporate responsibility. Achieving our ESG goals requires long-term investments and broad, coordinated activity, and we may be required to incur additional costs or allocate additional resources towards monitoring, reporting and implementing our ESG practices. Further, we may fail to accurately assess our stakeholders’ ESG priorities, as such priorities have evolved and will continue to evolve. While we have achieved most of our goals set in prior years, whether we can achieve our current and future ESG goals continues to be uncertain and remains subject to numerous risks, including evolving regulatory requirements and social expectations affecting ESG practices, our ability to recruit, develop and retain a diverse workforce, the availability of suppliers and collaboration partners that can meet our ESG goals, the effects of the organic growth of our business and potential 49acquisitions of other businesses on our ESG performance, and the availability and cost of technologies or resources, such as carbon credits, that support our goals. For example, impacts on the commodity market and supply chains caused by the armed conflict in Ukraine could limit the availability of electric vehicle components, impairing our ability to meet some of our environmental sustainability goals. Any failure or perceived failure to meet our ESG program priorities could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and stock price.The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations.Many of our operations and facilities, including those essential to our manufacturing, R&D and distribution activities, are in locations that are subject to natural disasters, including droughts, fires, extreme temperatures, hurricanes, tropical storms and/or floods. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Maria caused catastrophic damage, compounded in 2022 by Hurricane Fiona, to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where we perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities. Although our site was well-protected and suffered minimal damage, there can be no assurances that we would have similar results in the face of future natural disasters. The severity and frequency of weather-related natural disasters has been amplified, and is expected to continue to be amplified by, global climate change. Such natural disasters have caused, and in the future may cause, damage to and/or disrupt our operations, which may result in a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Our suppliers, vendors and business partners also face similar risks, and any disruption to their operations could have an adverse effect on our supply and manufacturing chain. Further, many of our key facilities are located on islands, including Puerto Rico, Singapore and Ireland, which rely on essential port facilities that may be vulnerable to climate change-related or other natural disasters. Although we have detailed business continuity plans in place and periodic assessments of our natural disaster risk, any natural disaster may also result in prolonged interruption to our critical operational and business activities, and we may be required to incur significant costs to remedy the effects of such natural disasters and fully resume operations, which may result in a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. See We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials and Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.GENERAL RISK FACTORSGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. The economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic precipitated a global recession, and together with high rates of inflation and energy supply issues experienced in certain regions, have led to regional and/or global macroeconomic challenges, the effects of which may be of an extended duration. In particular, acute rising energy costs may further adversely affect productivity and economic conditions in Europe. Additionally, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures in healthcare and other settings. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships (including inflation) may also affect patients’ ability to afford healthcare as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. The current inflationary environment related to increased aggregate demand, supply chain constraints and the effects from the armed conflict in Ukraine (including the effects of the sanctions that were implemented in response to the conflict and the resulting impacts on the commodity market and supply chains) have also increased our operating expenses and may continue to affect our operating expenses. Our operational costs, including the cost of energy, materials, labor, distribution and our other operational and facilities costs are subject to market conditions and are being adversely affected by inflationary pressures. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors’, customers’ and suppliers’ financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. A significant worsening of global economic conditions could precipitate or materially amplify the other risks described herein.We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets. The global spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. We have certain assets, including equity investments, that are exposed to market fluctuations that could, in a sustained 50or recurrent series of market disruptions, result in impairments. The value of our investments may also be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, inflation, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments.Our stock price is volatile.Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Announcements or discussions, including via social media channels, of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would negatively affect our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. Similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid effect on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially affected.We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. For example, early in 2020, there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper market and several borrowers were unable to obtain funding at normal rates or maturities, which resulted in a significant increase in draws of corporate credit lines with banks. Similarly, the bond markets experienced extreme volatility in terms of interest rates and credit spreads, with several days without new issuances of corporate bonds. We expect to access the capital markets, from time to time, to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we strategically plan to pursue, including acquisitions (such as our acquisition of Horizon) and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations or our ability to complete business acquisitions. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.Item 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.51Item 2.PROPERTIESAs of December 31, 2022, we owned or leased approximately 150 properties.

A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world’s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.Our principal products are ENBREL, Prolia, Otezla, XGEVA, Aranesp, Nplate, Repatha, KYPROLIS, Neulasta and EVENITY. We also market a number of other products, including MVASI, Vectibix, BLINCYTO, EPOGEN, AMGEVITA, Aimovig, Parsabiv, KANJINTI, LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, TEZSPIRE, NEUPOGEN, Sensipar/Mimpara and TAVNEOS. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.Our strategy includes integrated activities intended to strengthen our competitive position in the industry. We operate in six commercial areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology, bone health, cardiovascular (CV) disease, nephrology and neuroscience. We conduct discovery research primarily in three therapeutic areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology and general medicine. In 2022, we advanced our innovative pipeline, grew our international business, completed a strategic transaction to augment our marketed product portfolio, announced our intention to acquire Horizon and continued providing uninterrupted supplies of our medicines globally through the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We accomplished these objectives while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation and advancing our ESG efforts.In 2022, we continued to advance our pipeline, initiating phase 3 clinical trials for a number of programs, including LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS for advanced colorectal cancer, olpasiran for CV disease and rocatinlimab for atopic dermatitis. We continued to grow our international business, including achieving key regulatory approvals for TEZSPIRE in the EU and Japan. Our external business development activities for 2022 included the acquisition of ChemoCentryx, adding recently launched TAVNEOS to our inflammation portfolio. We also continued to advance our biosimilar program, with launches in new markets. Our biosimilars are expected to continue launching in new markets throughout 2023, including the U.S. launch of AMJEVITA in January 2023.During 2022, while gradually recovering from the global pandemic and facing increased competition from biosimilars and generics, total product sales increased 2%, primarily driven by volume growth for certain brands, partially offset by declines in net selling prices of certain products and unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates. Product sales increased 3% in the United States, primarily driven by volume growth, partially offset by declines in net selling prices, and increased 1% in ROW, primarily driven by volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates and declines in net selling prices. Total operating expenses decreased 9% due to both the acquired IPR&D write-off from the Five Prime acquisition and a licensing-related upfront payment to KKC in 2021, partially offset by a loss on a nonstrategic divestiture in 2022.Cash flows from operating activities totaled $9.7 billion, which supported investment in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. For 2022, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.94 per share of common stock. In December 2022, we declared a cash dividend of $2.13 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2023. We also repurchased 26.1 million shares of our common stock during 2022 at an aggregate cost of $6.3 billion. In 2022, we received net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $6.9 billion and extinguished $0.3 billion of debt. In December 2022, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Horizon, we entered into a bridge credit agreement and a term loan credit agreement which provide for borrowings in the aggregate of $28.5 billion.Amgen’s approach to and investment in human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating, developing and retaining talent to tackle the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines. Our compensation, benefits and development programs are designed to encourage performance, promote accountability and adherence to Company values, and align with the interests of the Company’s shareholders. Further, we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation, which supports our ability to serve patients. We are engaging in activities and setting goals to improve our focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging. For further information on these and other efforts, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Human Capital Resources.56We have a long-standing ambition to be environmentally responsible, and we regularly set targets to challenge ourselves to deliver further improvements. We achieved our targets for the 2013–2020 period while growing revenues, increasing production capacity and expanding to approximately 100 countries over the same period. To continue on our path to greater environmental sustainability, in January 2021 we announced a new set of long-term environmental targets to achieve by 2027, including achieving carbon neutrality, reducing water consumption by 40% and reducing waste disposed by 75%.(1)(2) Additionally, in 2022 we issued our first green bonds to finance eligible projects that meet specified criteria to reduce our impact on the environment.Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses from when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. Certain of our products face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents, and Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities, but successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We also face increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.Rising healthcare costs, uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including higher inflation and rising interest rates, and geopolitical conflicts continue to pose challenges to our business. As a result of public and private healthcare-provider focus, the industry continues to be subject to cost containment measures and significant pricing pressures, including net price declines. Moreover, legislation enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures, including provisions of the IRA, have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These buying patterns can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales but have generally not been significant to date when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products, and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain factors that could impact our future product sales.COVID-19 pandemicSince the onset of the pandemic in 2020, we have been closely monitoring the pandemic’s effects on our global operations. We continue to take appropriate steps to minimize risks to our employees, a significant number of whom have continued to work virtually. To date, our remote working arrangements have not significantly affected our ability to maintain critical business operations, and we have not experienced disruptions to or shortages of our supply of medicines.Over the course of the pandemic we have experienced changes in demand for some of our products as fluctuations in the frequency of patient visits to doctors’ offices have impacted the provision of treatments to existing patients and reduced diagnoses in new patients. During 2021, there was a gradual recovery in both patient visits and diagnosis rates that approached pre-pandemic levels. In 2022, the pandemic continued to impact the healthcare sector and our business, to varying degrees across our markets. During 2022, with the exception of the Asia Pacific region that was affected by lockdowns during most of the year, we saw greater stability in patient visits and demand patterns even in areas that were facing surges in the virus. Given the evolution of COVID-19 since its onset, including the proliferation of variants, we cannot predict the impact of future virus surges on our business and will continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business and on the healthcare sector more generally.Since early 2021, efforts have been under way to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, uncertainty remains as to the efficacy of these activities with respect to the ongoing trajectory of the pandemic. Challenges to vaccination efforts, new variants and other causes of virus spread may require governments to change restrictions and/or shutdown requirements in various geographies. As a result, we expect to see continued volatility for at least the duration of the pandemic as governments respond to current local conditions. With regard to our clinical trial activities, we are continuously monitoring COVID-19 infection rates, including changes from new variants; we are working to mitigate effects on future study enrollment in our clinical trials; and we are evaluating the impact in all relevant countries. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in their providing care for patients and in our providing investigational drug supply. For a discussion of the risks the COVID-19 pandemic could present to our results, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.(1) Represents reductions against established baselines, taking into account only verified reduction projects and does not take into account changes associated with contraction or expansion of the Company.(2) Carbon neutrality goal refers to Scope 1 and 2.57Selected Financial InformationThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data):Year ended December 31, 2022ChangeYear ended December 31, 2021Product sales:U.S.$17,743 3 %$17,286 ROW7,058 1 %7,011 Total product sales24,801 2 %24,297 Other revenues1,522 (10)%1,682 Total revenues$26,323 1 %$25,979 Operating expenses$16,757 (9)%$18,340 Operating income$9,566 25 %$7,639 Net income$6,552 11 %$5,893 Diluted EPS$12.11 18 %$10.28 Diluted shares541 (6)%573 In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to volume growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers (such as physicians or their clinics), dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held by wholesaler customers and end users (such as pharmacies).Total product sales increased in 2022, primarily driven by volume growth for certain brands, including Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY, Nplate, LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, KYPROLIS, Otezla and TEZSPIRE, partially offset by declines in net selling prices of certain products, including Neulasta, Repatha and MVASI, and unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates. For 2023, we expect that net selling prices will continue to decline at a portfolio level driven by increased competition. Further, the first quarter of a year historically represents the lowest product sales quarter for the year, in part due to plan changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, particularly for products acquired through pharmacy benefit programs.As a result of uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we expect volatility around foreign currency exchange rates to continue. The impact of unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates will be partially offset by corresponding decreases in our international operating expenses. While not designed to completely address foreign currency changes, our hedging activities also seek to offset, in part, such effects on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros.As discussed above, our product sales have been affected by reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In general, the dynamics of the pandemic were most significant on our product sales in the early months of the pandemic, with demand beginning to show some recovery in late 2020. In late 2021 and early 2022, increased infection rates caused by variants of the virus (including Omicron) led to diminished capacity in the healthcare sector and reduced working days for our own sales force, which impacted our business. As of the second quarter of 2022, we saw the effects of these variants recede in most markets, which allowed us to engage in increased field-facing activities. Provider and patient activity also increased, leading to improvements in demand for our products to pre-pandemic levels. However, the cumulative decrease in diagnoses over the course of the pandemic has suppressed the volume of new patients starting treatment, which continues to impact our business. Given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, there could be intermittent disruptions in physician–patient interactions, and as a result, we may experience quarter-to-quarter variability. In addition, other changes in the healthcare ecosystem have the potential to introduce variability into product sales trends. For example, changes in U.S. employment have led to changes to the insured population. Growth in numbers of Medicaid enrollees and uninsured individuals, along with provisions of the IRA, may have a negative impact on product sales. Overall, uncertainty remains around the timing and magnitude of our sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.Other revenues decreased for 2022, driven by lower revenue from COVID-19 antibody material and licensing-related revenues.Operating expenses decreased for 2022 due to both the acquired IPR&D write-off related to the bemarituzumab program acquired as part of the Five Prime acquisition and a licensing-related upfront payment to KKC in 2021, partially offset by a loss 58on a nonstrategic divestiture in 2022.

Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2022ChangeYear ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020ENBREL — U.S.$4,044 (7)%$4,352 (10)%$4,855 ENBREL — Canada73 (35)%113 (20)%141 Total ENBREL$4,117 (8)%$4,465 (11)%$4,996 The decrease in ENBREL sales for 2022 was primarily driven by unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, lower volume and lower net selling price. For 2023, we expect ENBREL to follow the historical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles. In addition, for 2023, we expect further declines in net selling price.The decrease in ENBREL sales for 2021 was driven by lower net selling price, volume and unfavorable changes to inventory.59Prolia Total Prolia sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2022ChangeYear ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020Prolia — U.S.$2,465 15 %$2,150 17 %$1,830 Prolia — ROW1,163 6 %1,098 18 %933 Total Prolia$3,628 12 %$3,248 18 %$2,763 The increase in global Prolia sales for 2022 was driven by volume growth and higher net selling price, partially offset by unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates.The increase in global Prolia sales for 2021 was primarily driven by volume growth.OtezlaTotal Otezla sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2022ChangeYear ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020Otezla — U.S.$1,886 5 %$1,804 1 %$1,790 Otezla — ROW402 (10)%445 10 %405 Total Otezla$2,288 2 %$2,249 2 %$2,195 The increase in global Otezla sales for 2022 was primarily driven by volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. ROW Otezla sales for 2022 were impacted by unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates. For 2023, we expect Otezla to follow the historical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles.The increase in global Otezla sales for 2021 was driven by volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to inventory.For a discussion of ongoing litigation related to Otezla, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.XGEVATotal XGEVA sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2022ChangeYear ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020XGEVA — U.S.$1,480 3 %$1,434 2 %$1,405 XGEVA — ROW534 (9)%584 18 %494 Total XGEVA$2,014 — %$2,018 6 %$1,899 Global XGEVA sales were relatively unchanged for 2022 as higher net selling price was offset by lower volume as a result of increased competition and unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates.The increase in global XGEVA sales for 2021 was primarily driven by volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price.60AranespTotal Aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2022ChangeYear ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020Aranesp — U.S.$521 (3)%$537 (15)%$629 Aranesp — ROW900 (5)%943 — %939 Total Aranesp$1,421 (4)%$1,480 (6)%$1,568 The decrease in global Aranesp sales for 2022 was driven by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and volume growth.The decrease in global Aranesp sales for 2021 was primarily driven by lower net selling price.Aranesp continues to face competition from a long-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) and from a biosimilar version of EPOGEN, which will impact net selling price and volume in the future.NplateTotal Nplate sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2022ChangeYear ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020Nplate — U.S.$848 50 %$566 17 %$485 Nplate — ROW459 — %461 26 %365 Total Nplate$1,307 27 %$1,027 21 %$850 The increase in global Nplate sales for 2022 was driven by volume growth.

Volume benefited from contracting changes to support and improve Medicare Part D and commercial patient access and the inclusion of Repatha on China’s National Reimbursement Drug List as of January 1, 2022, both of which resulted in decreases to the net selling price in 2022.The increase in global Repatha sales for 2021 was driven by volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. For a discussion of ongoing litigation related to Repatha, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.61KYPROLISTotal KYPROLIS sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2022ChangeYear ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020KYPROLIS — U.S.$850 15 %$736 4 %$710 KYPROLIS — ROW397 7 %372 5 %355 Total KYPROLIS$1,247 13 %$1,108 4 %$1,065 The increases in global KYPROLIS sales for 2022 and 2021 were primarily driven by volume growth.The FDA has reported that it has granted tentative or final approval of ANDAs for generic carfilzomib products filed by a number of companies. The date of approval of those ANDAs for generic carfilzomib products is governed by the Hatch–Waxman Act and any applicable settlement agreements between us and certain companies that seek to develop generic carfilzomib products.NeulastaTotal Neulasta sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2022ChangeYear ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020Neulasta — U.S.$959 (37)%$1,514 (24)%$2,001 Neulasta — ROW167 (24)%220 (25)%292 Total Neulasta$1,126 (35)%$1,734 (24)%$2,293 The decreases in global Neulasta sales for 2022 and 2021 were driven by lower net selling price and volume. Increased competition as a result of biosimilar versions of Neulasta has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on brand sales, including accelerating net price erosion and lower volume. We also expect other biosimilar versions, including biosimilars that will use an on-body injector that would compete with our Onpro injector, to be approved in the future.EVENITYTotal EVENITY sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2022ChangeYear ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020EVENITY — U.S.$533 61 %$331 73 %$191 EVENITY — ROW254 28 %199 25 %159 Total EVENITY$787 48 %$530 51 %$350 The increases in global EVENITY sales for 2022 and 2021 were driven by volume growth across our markets. 62Other productsOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Year ended December 31, 2022ChangeYear ended December 31, 2021ChangeYear ended December 31, 2020MVASI — U.S.$602 (27)%$826 26 %$656 MVASI — ROW299 (12)%340 *142 Vectibix — U.S.396 14 %347 1 %342 Vectibix — ROW497 (6)%526 12 %469 BLINCYTO — U.S.336 21 %278 20 %231 BLINCYTO — ROW247 27 %194 31 %148 EPOGEN — U.S.506 (3)%521 (13)%598 AMGEVITA — ROW460 5 %439 33 %331 Aimovig — U.S.398 27 %313 (17)%378 Aimovig — ROW16 *4 NM— Parsabiv — U.S.253 69 %150 (75)%605 Parsabiv— ROW129 (1)%130 17 %111 KANJINTI — U.S.257 (46)%479 1 %475 KANJINTI — ROW59 (37)%93 1 %92 LUMAKRAS — U.S.222 *82 NM— LUMYKRAS — ROW63 *8 NM— TEZSPIRE — U.S.170 NM— NM— NEUPOGEN — U.S.87 (14)%101 (30)%144 NEUPOGEN — ROW57 (15)%67 (17)%81 Sensipar — U.S.10 67 %6 (93)%92 Sensipar/Mimpara — ROW54 (31)%78 (60)%196 TAVNEOS — U.S.(1)16 NM— NM— TAVNEOS — ROW(1)5 NM— NM— Other — U.S.(2)296 47 %202 85 %109 Other — ROW(2)135 (1)%137 (21)%174 Total other product sales$5,570 5 %$5,321 (1)%$5,374 Total U.S. — other products$3,549 7 %$3,305 (9)%$3,630 Total ROW — other products2,021 — %2,016 16 %1,744 Total other product sales$5,570 5 %$5,321 (1)%$5,374 NM = not meaningful* Change in excess of 100%____________(1) TAVNEOS was acquired on October 20, 2022 from our acquisition of ChemoCentryx.

These categories are described below:CategoryDescriptionResearch and early pipeline R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism and process developmentLater-stage clinical programsR&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product primarily in the United States or the EUMarketed productsR&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold primarily in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained64R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions):Years ended December 31,202220212020Research and early pipeline$1,611 $1,670 $1,405 Later-stage clinical programs1,627 1,726 1,365 Marketed products1,196 1,423 1,437 Total R&D expense$4,434 $4,819 $4,207 The decrease in R&D expense for 2022 was driven by higher business development activity in 2021 included in later-stage clinical programs and research and early pipeline and lower marketed products support, partially offset by higher later-stage clinical programs support and research and early pipeline spend.The increase in R&D expense for 2021 was driven by a licensing-related upfront payment to KKC included in later-stage clinical programs and higher spend in research and early pipeline, including other business development activities.Acquired in-process research and developmentThe Acquired IPR&D expense in 2021 was related to the bemarituzumab program, which was acquired as part of the Five Prime acquisition in 2021. See Part IV—Note 2, Acquisitions and divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Selling, general and administrativeThe increase in SG&A expense for 2022 was primarily driven by higher acquisition-related expenses.The decrease in SG&A expense for 2021 was primarily driven by lower spend for marketed products and lower general and administrative expenses.OtherOther operating expenses for 2022 primarily consisted of a loss on a nonstrategic divestiture. See Part IV—Note 2, Acquisitions and divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other operating expenses for 2021 primarily consisted of expenses related to cost-savings initiatives and a legal judgment.Other operating expenses for 2020 primarily consisted of legal settlement expenses.Nonoperating expenses/income and income taxesNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):Years ended December 31,202220212020Interest expense, net$(1,406)$(1,197)$(1,262)Other (expense) income, net$(814)$259 $256 Provision for income taxes$794 $808 $869 Effective tax rate10.8 %12.1 %10.7 %Interest expense, netThe increase in Interest expense, net, for 2022 was primarily due to higher overall debt outstanding and higher LIBORs on debt for which we effectively pay a variable rate of interest through the use of interest rate swaps.The decrease in Interest expense, net, for 2021 was primarily due to net higher costs associated with the early retirement of debt in 2020 and lower LIBORs in 2021 on debt for which we effectively pay a variable rate of interest through the use of interest rate swaps, partially offset by higher overall debt outstanding.65Other (expense) income, netThe change in Other (expense) income, net, for 2022 was primarily due to higher losses recognized in connection with our BeiGene investment compared with 2021 and losses recognized on our investments in limited partnerships, publicly traded equity securities and other strategic investments.The change in Other (expense) income, net, for 2021 was primarily due to lower losses incurred in connection with our BeiGene investment compared with 2020, partially offset by lower income on our interest-bearing investments in 2021 and other nonrecurring gains recognized in 2020.Income taxesThe decrease in our effective tax rate for 2022 compared with 2021 was primarily due to the nondeductible IPR&D expense arising from the acquisition of Five Prime in the prior year, partially offset by a nondeductible loss on a nonstrategic divestiture in 2022 and net unfavorable items as compared to the prior year.The increase in our effective tax rate for 2021 compared with 2020 was primarily driven by the nondeductible IPR&D expense arising from the acquisition of Five Prime, partially offset by earnings mix and adjustments to prior-year tax liabilities.The Administration and Congress continue to discuss changes to existing tax law that could substantially increase the taxes we pay to the U.S. government. Further, the OECD recently reached an agreement to align countries on a minimum corporate tax rate and an expansion of the taxing rights of market countries. If enacted, either by all OECD participants or unilaterally by individual countries, this agreement could result in a tax increase that could affect our U.S. and foreign tax liabilities. The U.S. Treasury released final foreign tax credit regulations in December 2021 that eliminated U.S. creditability of the Puerto Rico Excise Tax beginning in 2023, which would have increased our U.S. tax liability. In response, on June 30, 2022, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico enacted Act 52-2022, which provides for an alternate fixed tax rate on industrial development income that the U.S. Treasury confirmed will be creditable under federal law. As part of this new law, eligible businesses will be subject to incremental income and withholding taxes in lieu of payment of the Puerto Rico Excise Tax. In order to qualify for the alternative fixed tax rate, our current tax grant with the Puerto Rico government was amended in December 2022. We qualify for this alternative fixed tax rate, beginning January 1, 2023 and our tax expense will increase. In 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010–2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) for the years 2010–2012 that we received in May and July 2021, which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2010–2012 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $3.6 billion plus interest. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2010–2012 would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings. In 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013–2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010–2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2022, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest a Notice for the years 2013–2015 that we previously reported receiving in April 2022 that seeks to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2013–2015 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $5.1 billion, plus interest. In addition, the Notice asserts penalties of approximately $2.0 billion. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2013–2015 would be reduced by up to approximately $2.2 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings. We firmly believe that the IRS positions set forth in the 2010–2012 and 2013–2015 Notices are without merit. We are contesting the 2010–2012 and 2013–2015 Notices through the judicial process. The two cases were consolidated in U.S. Tax Court on December 19, 2022.We are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016–2018 with respect to issues similar to those for the 2010 through 2015 period. In addition, we are under examination by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions.Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We continue to believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and 66uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability; Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Income taxes; and Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected financial data was as follows (in millions):December 31,20222021Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$9,305 $8,037 Total assets$65,121 $61,165 Current portion of long-term debt$1,591 $87 Long-term debt$37,354 $33,222 Stockholders’ equity$3,661 $6,700 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesOur balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $9.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Capital allocationConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we deploy our accumulated cash balances in a strategic manner and consider a number of alternatives, including investments in innovation, both internally and externally, strategic transactions (including those that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest), repayment of debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We intend to continue investing in our business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases, thereby reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business and our desire to optimize our cost of capital. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company’s agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by our overall level of cash, stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include block purchases, tender offers, accelerated share repurchases and market transactions.The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.94, $1.76 and $1.60 per share of common stock paid in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 10% over the prior year in both 2022 and 2021. In December 2022, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $2.13 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2023.We also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2022, we repurchased $6.3 billion of common stock, including $6.0 billion under ASR agreements and had cash settlements for stock repurchases of $6.4 billion. In 2021, we repurchased and had cash settlements of $5.0 billion of common stock. In 2020, we repurchased and had cash settlements of $3.5 billion of common stock. In October 2022, the Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by $2.4 billion. As of December 31, 2022, $7.0 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.67As a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our accumulated deficit is not anticipated to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our expected continued profitability and strong financial position.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock, and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities, and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Financing arrangementsTo help meet our liquidity requirements, we have entered into various financing arrangements. The noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, were $37.4 billion and $33.2 billion, respectively. The carrying values of our long-term borrowings are net of fair value adjustments for interest rate swaps and unamortized discounts, premiums and offering costs. As of December 31, 2022, S&P, Moody’s and Fitch assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of BBB+, Baa1 and BBB+, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings.During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we issued debt with aggregate principal amounts of $7.0 billion, $5.0 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively. During 2022, we repurchased portions of our debt at a cost of $0.3 billion. During 2021 and 2020, we repaid/redeemed debt of $4.2 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. In addition, during 2020, we exchanged $0.7 billion of certain of our outstanding note issuances with $0.9 billion of newly issued notes with a lower interest rate and later maturity date.To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating, LIBOR-based coupon over the lives of the respective notes. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amount of $6.7 billion.To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amount of $3.4 billion.As of December 31, 2022, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.In 2019, we amended and restated our $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement, which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $750 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. In December 2022, this revolving credit agreement was further amended to replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate, pursuant to provisions contained therein related to determination of successor rates in case of phaseout or unavailability of existing designated reference rates. Generally, we would be charged interest for any amounts borrowed under this facility, based on our current credit rating, at (i) SOFR plus 1.125% or (ii) the highest of (A) the syndication agent bank base commercial lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (C) one-month SOFR plus 1.1%. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.In December 2022, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Horizon, we entered into a bridge credit agreement and a term loan credit agreement which provide for borrowings in the aggregate of $28.5 billion. As of December 31, 2022, no amounts have been borrowed under either agreement. See Part IV—Note 2, Acquisitions and divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.68It is anticipated that the U.S. dollar LIBOR rate will be phased out and replaced by 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of private-market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help ensure a successful transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR to a more robust reference rate, recommends SOFR as the U.S. dollar LIBOR alternative. As such, we expect SOFR to become widely adopted by market participants. We do not expect this change to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.In February 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2023, and our Board has approved a new shelf registration statement to replace it.Certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement, bridge credit agreement and term loan credit agreement include a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the respective agreements. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2022. These financing arrangements are more fully discussed in Part IV—Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash flowsOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions):Years ended December 31,202220212020Net cash provided by operating activities$9,721 $9,261 $10,497 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities$(6,044)$733 $(5,401)Net cash used in financing activities$(4,037)$(8,271)$(4,867)OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2022 primarily due to the timing of payments for sales incentives and discounts, vendor purchases, liabilities to tax authorities and receipts from corporate partners, partially offset by higher manufacturing activities in the current year. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2021 primarily due to the monetization of interest rate swaps that occurred in 2020 and the timing of payments for sales incentives and discounts.InvestingCash used in investing activities during 2022 was primarily due to our $3.8 billion purchase of ChemoCentryx and net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $1.4 billion. Cash provided by investing activities during 2021 was primarily due to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $4.3 billion, partially offset by cash used in the acquisitions of Teneobio and Five Prime of $2.5 billion. Cash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily due to our $3.2 billion of purchases of equity method investments, primarily BeiGene, and net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $1.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $936 million, $880 million and $608 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We currently estimate 2023 spending on capital projects to be approximately $925 million. A majority of the increase in expenditures relates to expansion of manufacturing capacity to enable supply of products and product candidates.69FinancingCash used in financing activities during 2022 was primarily due to payments to repurchase our common stock of $6.4 billion and dividends paid of $4.2 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt of $6.9 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2021 was primarily due to payments to repurchase our common stock of $5.0 billion and the payment of dividends of $4.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments of $0.8 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2020 was primarily due to the payment of dividends of $3.8 billion and payments to repurchase our common stock of $3.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments of $2.5 billion.See Part IV—Note 9, Investments; Note 15, Financing arrangements; and Note 16, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Capital requirementsWe have material cash requirements to pay third parties under various contractual obligations discussed below.We are obligated to pay interest and repay principal under our various financing arrangements, including amounts under interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts related to certain of our long-term debt obligations. For information on scheduled debt maturities and payments under derivative contracts associated with our long-term debt obligations, see Part IV—Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We are obligated to make payments for operating leases, including rental commitments on abandoned leases and leases that have not yet commenced. For information on these obligations, see Part IV—Note 13, Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Under the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay in eight annual installments the repatriation tax related primarily to prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations. For information on the remaining scheduled repatriation tax installments, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments—Commitments—U.S. repatriation tax, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We have purchase obligations of $3.5 billion primarily related to (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Most of these obligations are expected to be paid within one year, and payment of certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. In addition to the purchase obligations noted above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts that in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of Teneobio and K-A. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring, and any resulting cash requirements are managed through our operational budgeting processes. Except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration of approximately $0.3 billion, these obligations are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $5.6 billion.We have recorded liabilities for UTBs that, because of their nature, have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payment and other events that extinguish these liabilities. See Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.70Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are included in Part IV—Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies. The following are considered critical to our consolidated financial statements because they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.Product sales and sales deductionsRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions):RebatesChargebacksOther deductionsTotalBalance as of December 31, 2019$3,165 $559 $156 $3,880 Amounts charged against product sales9,167 8,223 1,818 19,208 Payments(8,353)(8,191)(1,735)(18,279)Balance as of December 31, 20203,979 591 239 4,809 Amounts charged against product sales10,195 9,619 2,065 21,879 Payments(10,027)(9,413)(2,074)(21,514)Balance as of December 31, 20214,147 797 230 5,174 Amounts charged against product sales12,500 10,630 2,288 25,418 Payments(11,768)(10,578)(2,260)(24,606)Balance as of December 31, 2022$4,879 $849 $258 $5,986 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, total sales deductions were 51%, 47% and 44% of gross product sales, respectively. The increase in the total sales deductions balance as of December 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, was primarily driven by the impact of higher U.S. chargeback and commercial rebate discount rates and an increase in gross sales, partially offset by timing of payments. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. In the United States, we use wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold.Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements that vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels; and we accrue these rebates in the period the related sales are recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect 71actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results because chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.Product returnsReturns are estimated by comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.Income taxesWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, when appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.Certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements, and they cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as tax deductions or credits in tax returns in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and the tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, because future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. We are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. In the jurisdictions where we conduct operations, we are subject to income tax based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and on the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2050.In 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010–2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) for the years 2010–2012 that we received in May and July 2021, which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2010–2012 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $3.6 billion plus interest. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2010–2012 would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings.72In 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013–2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010–2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2022, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest a Notice for the years 2013–2015 that we received in April 2022 that seeks to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2013–2015 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $5.1 billion, plus interest. In addition, the Notice asserts penalties of approximately $2.0 billion. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2013–2015 would be reduced by up to approximately $2.2 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings.We firmly believe that the IRS positions set forth in the 2010–2012 and 2013–2015 Notices are without merit. We are contesting the 2010–2012 and 2013–2015 Notices through the judicial process. The two cases were consolidated in U.S. Tax Court on December 19, 2022.We are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016–2018 with respect to issues similar to those for the 2010 through 2015 period. In addition, we have examinations by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions.Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability; Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations, Income taxes; and Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes and class action suits that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitionsWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in an acquisition. See Part IV—Note 2, Acquisitions and divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to:•determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;•projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;•estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and73•developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the business combination date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included but were not limited to the timing and probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.Impairment of long-lived assetsWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared with the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value.Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination that have not reached technological feasibility or that lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference, and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.Impairment of equity method investmentsWe review the carrying value of our equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an investment may not be recoverable. We record impairment losses on our equity method investments if we deem the impairment to be other-than-temporary. We deem an impairment to be other-than-temporary based on various factors, including but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value is below the carrying value, volatility of the security price, the financial condition of the issuer, changes in technology that may impair the earnings potential of the investment and our intent and ability to retain the investment to allow for a recovery in fair value. We believe our judgments used in assessing impairment of equity method investments are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Part IV—Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2022.74Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.In the discussion that follows, we assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Except as noted below, we also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.Interest-rate-sensitive financial instrumentsOur portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was composed almost entirely of U.S. Treasury securities and money market mutual funds. The fair values of our available-for-sale investments were $4.3 billion and $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would not have resulted in a material reduction in the fair values of these securities. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year.As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $38.9 billion and a fair value of $35.0 billion. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.3 billion and a fair value of $37.9 billion. Our outstanding debt was composed of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would have resulted in an increase of $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on these dates. Analysis of the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below.To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective notes. Interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $6.7 billion were outstanding as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $210 million and $330 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates. Analysis of the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest-rate-sensitive instruments were designed to offset. In connection with the anticipated issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt, we occasionally enter into forward interest rate contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges, in order to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the applicable U.S. Treasury rate between the time we enter into these contracts and the time the related debt is issued. As of December 31, 2022, we had forward interest rate contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $700 million; there were no outstanding forward interest rate contracts as of December 31, 2021. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2022 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $60 million on our forward interest rate contracts on this date.As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amount of $3.4 billion that hedge our foreign-currency-denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $90 million and $170 million, respectively.75Foreign-currency-sensitive financial instrumentsOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared with foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward and cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $3.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $580 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $600 million. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $710 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $640 million. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the related foreign-currency-denominated debt.We have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs, with aggregate notional amount of $3.4 billion as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $540 million and $700 million on these dates, respectively. The impact of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates on ensuing years’ income from these contracts would be fully offset by corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2022, the fair values of these contracts were a $288 million asset and a $76 million liability. As of December 31, 2021, the fair values of these contracts were a $183 million asset and a $39 million liability. As of December 31, 2022, we had primarily euro-based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $6.0 billion. As of December 31, 2021, we had primarily euro-based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.7 billion. With regard to foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $1.1 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $590 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $1.1 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $390 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had open, short-duration, foreign currency forward contracts that mature in one month or less, that had notional amounts of $0.5 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, and that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, a hypothetical 5% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.Market-price-sensitive financial instrumentsAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we were exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments include publicly and privately held small-capitalization stocks, limited partnerships that invest in early-stage biotechnology companies 76and our investment in BeiGene. A 20% decrease in the aggregate value of our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would result in losses in fair value of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.Counterparty credit risksOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk, which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring that transactions be made only with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A– or equivalent by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch; and it places exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.It",2023-12-30 18:04:52.247387

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Certain of the Company’s legal proceedings are discussed below. While it is impossible to predict accurately or to determine the eventual outcome of these matters, the Company believes that the outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the annual financial statements of the Company. Genentech litigation On October 16, 1996, Genentech filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California Court”) for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 4,704,362, 5,221,619, and 4,342,832 (the “‘362, ‘619, and ‘832 Patents”), relating to vectors for expressing cloned genes and the methods for such expression. Genentech alleged that Amgen infringed its patents by manufacturing and selling NEUPOGEN®. On February 10, 1997, Genentech served an additional counterclaim asserting U.S. Patent No. 5,583,013 (the “‘013 Patent”), issued December 10, 1996. At a hearing held on May 29, 1998, the parties stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of claims with respect to the ‘832 Patent. The judge issued a final claim construction ruling interpreting the ‘362, ‘619, and ‘013 Patent claims which, among other things, essentially limited the claim term “control region” to DNA taken from a single operon and not constructed from control elements derived from various operons. On October 12, 2000, the California Court entered Final Judgment in the Company’s favor on the basis of no infringement. Genentech filed a notice of appeal. The parties filed briefs before the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments were heard on October 9, 2001. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision April 29, 2002 vacating summary judgment of no literal infringement and affirming Genentech’s non-compliance with the local rules, thereby precluding Genentech from proceeding on a theory of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California to determine the issue of literal infringement under a revised claim construction, as well as the validity and enforceability of Genentech’s patents. The District Court issued an order dated January 24, 2003 denying the Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment of No Literal Infringement. The District Court issued an order dated February 10, 2003 granting Genentech’s Motion for Summary Judgment of No Inequitable Conduct, dismissing that defense with prejudice. A trial date has been set for September 2, 2003. Transkaryotic Therapies and Aventis litigation On April 15, 1997, Amgen filed suit in the Massachusetts District Court against Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (“TKT”) and Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc. (“HMR”—now Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc., together with TKT, the “Defendants”) alleging infringement of three U.S. patents owned by Amgen that claim an erythropoietin product and processes for making erythropoietin. Amgen sought an injunction preventing the Defendants from making, importing, using, or selling erythropoietin in the United States. On October 7, 1999, Amgen filed an amended complaint, which added two additional patents to the litigation. Defendants’ amended answer asserted that all five of the patents-in-suit were not infringed, were invalid, or were unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Amgen’s motion for summary judgment of literal infringement was granted by the Massachusetts District Court on April 26, 2000 with respect to claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 5,955,422 (the “‘422 Patent”). On May 15, 2000, trial began in the Massachusetts District Court. On June 9, 2000, the Massachusetts District Court granted Defendants’ motion for non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,618,698 (the “‘698 Patent”), removing the ‘698 Patent from this action. On July 21, 2000, the Massachusetts District Court granted Amgen’s motion for judgment on the Defendants’ defenses of invalidity based upon anticipation and obviousness. On January 19, 2001, the Massachusetts District Court ruled that claims 2-4 of the ‘080 Patent, claims 1, 3, 4, and 6 of the ‘349 Patent and claim 1 of the ‘422 Patent were valid, enforceable, and infringed by TKT’s EPO product and the cells used to make such product. The Massachusetts District Court also held that claim 7 of the ‘349 patent and claims 1, 2, and 9 of the ‘933 Patent were not infringed, and that if infringed the claims of the ‘933 patent would be invalid. 25 Table of Contents On January 26, 2001, TKT and HMR filed a Notice of Appeal and on February 14, 2001, Amgen filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On March 22, 2001, Amgen filed an Amended Notice of Cross-Appeal to include claim 9 of the ‘698 patent. After the parties briefed the issues on appeal, oral arguments were heard on May 7, 2002 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On January 6, 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the District Court’s decision that TKT and HMR infringe the ‘349 and ‘422 patents. The court further upheld the enforceability and validity of all of the asserted claims except for validity over two references which was vacated and remanded to the District Court. The court vacated and remanded to the District Court of Massachusetts for further consideration of (i) the finding of infringement of the ‘080 patent, (ii) the holding of non-infringement of the ‘698 patent, and (iii) the effect of two references on the validity of the asserted claims of the patents. On January 20, 2003, TKT and HMR filed a Combined Motion for Panel Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc with the Federal Circuit regarding the court’s affirmance of the validity of the asserted claims under 35 U.S.C. § 112. On March 3, 2003, the Federal Circuit denied TKT and HMR’s Motions for Panel Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc. Average Wholesale Price Litigation Amgen has been served with complaints in ten separate civil actions broadly alleging that it, together with a large number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, reported prices for certain products that overstate the Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”), allegedly inflating reimbursement, including co-payments paid to providers who prescribe and administer the products. An additional civil complaint naming Amgen as a defendant has been filed against the Company, but not formally served upon the Company. In addition, Immunex has been served with eight civil AWP actions and has been named in a ninth complaint that has not been formally served upon Immunex.

The complaint alleges that Wyeth and the Immunex Board breached fiduciary duties owed to Immunex shareholders by stalling the merger discussions with Amgen as a result of positions taken by Wyeth in the negotiations relating to its control of Immunex and its marketing rights in future Immunex products. The complaint further alleges that Wyeth and the Immunex Board were favoring their own interests and not acting in good faith toward plaintiff and the purported class. On March 25, 2002, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, alleging that Wyeth and the Immunex Board breached their fiduciary duties owed to Immunex shareholders by approving the merger with Amgen with terms that do not allow consideration of competing offers and by failing to disclose to Immunex shareholders certain information concerning the benefits to be received by Wyeth and certain Immunex directors/officers upon the completion of the merger. The amended complaint further alleges that Amgen aided and abetted Wyeth and the Immunex Board in the breach of their fiduciary duties owed to Immunex shareholders by offering Wyeth and certain Immunex directors/officers disproportionate consideration for approval of the merger with Amgen. Plaintiff seeks: certification as a class action and certification of plaintiff as class representative; preliminary and permanent injunction against proceeding with, or closing, the merger or any transaction that improperly favors the interests of Wyeth; rescission of the merger if it is consummated; and an award of the costs including attorneys’ and experts’ fees.

In connection with the settlement, (i) Immunex and Amgen agreed to reduce the termination fee payable by Immunex or Amgen under certain circumstances set forth in the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 16, 2001 between Amgen, AMS Acquisition Inc., and Immunex by $20 million, (ii) Immunex obtained an updated opinion from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated regarding the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view to be received by Immunex shareholders, and (iii) Immunex agreed to provide certain additional disclosures regarding the merger in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed with the SEC on April 30, 2002. Stockholder Derivative Lawsuit On March 14, 2002, Linda Blatchly, an alleged stockholder of Amgen, filed a purported stockholder derivative lawsuit against all members of the Amgen board of directors (the “Amgen Board”) and nominally against Amgen in the Ventura County Superior Court of California. The complaint alleges, among other things, that, after the filing with the SEC of the Annual Report of Immunex on Form 10-K on March 8, 2002 which contained disclosure regarding the lease for the new Immunex facility in Seattle, the Amgen Board members breached their fiduciary duties to Amgen by refusing to renegotiate or terminate the acquisition of Immunex, failing to disclose the true value of the financial condition of Immunex and seeking to acquire Immunex without conducting adequate due diligence. The complaint seeks: a declaration that the Amgen Board members have breached and are breaching their fiduciary and other duties to Amgen and the Amgen stockholders; preliminary and permanent injunction against proceeding with the merger; an order requiring an independent evaluation as to 29 Table of Contents (a) the true worth of Immunex, and (b) if it is determined that the acquisition of Immunex is in the best interests of Amgen, requiring an adjustment of the merger consideration; compensatory damages against defendants in favor of Amgen; and costs including attorneys’ fees. The plaintiff in the purported stockholder derivative lawsuit filed against all members of the Amgen board of directors has tentatively agreed to a dismissal without prejudice for no consideration. Governmental Investigations According to press reports, approximately 20 pharmaceutical companies are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and/or state agencies related to the pricing of their products. Immunex has received notice from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting it to produce documents in connection with a Civil False Claims Act investigation of the pricing of Immunex’s current and former products for sale and eventual reimbursement by Medicare or state Medicaid programs. Immunex Corporation also received similar requests from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state agencies. Several of Immunex’s current and former products are or were regularly sold at substantial discounts from list price. The Company does not know what action, if any, the federal government or any state agency will take as a result of their investigations. Item 4.

The resale of the Convertible Notes by note holders was subsequently registered with the SEC in May 2002. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $2.82 billion (a $714.23 per note original issue price). The original issue discount of $1.13 billion (or $285.77 per note) is being accreted to interest expense over the life of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs totaled approximately $56.5 million and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the notes. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company repurchased 11.3 million shares at a total cost of $650 million. The remainder of the proceeds are available for use for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, additional share repurchases, capital expenditures, and working capital.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Acquisition of Immunex Corporation On July 15, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Immunex Corporation (“Immunex”) in a transaction accounted for as a business combination. Immunex was a leading biotechnology company dedicated to developing immune system science to protect human health. The acquisition of Immunex is expected to further advance Amgen’s role as a global biotechnology leader with the benefits of accelerated growth and increased size, product base, product pipeline, and employees. The acquisition is also intended to enhance Amgen’s strategic position within the biotechnology industry by strengthening and diversifying its (1) product base and product pipeline in key therapeutic areas, and (2) discovery research capabilities in proteins and antibodies. Each share of Immunex common stock outstanding at July 15, 2002 was converted into 0.44 of a share of Amgen common stock and $4.50 in cash. As a result, Amgen issued approximately 244.6 million shares of common stock and paid approximately $2.5 billion in cash to former Immunex shareholders. Amgen also paid Wyeth $25 million at the closing of the merger for the termination of certain Immunex product rights in favor of Wyeth, as specified in the agreement regarding governance and commercial matters. In addition, each employee stock option to purchase Immunex common stock outstanding at July 15, 2002 was assumed by Amgen and converted into an option to purchase Amgen common stock based on the terms specified in the merger agreement. As a result, approximately 22.4 million options to purchase Amgen common stock were assumed, on a converted basis. The acquisition was structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Unless otherwise indicated, the discussions in this report of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 and financial condition at December 31, 2002 include the results of operations of Immunex commencing from July 16, 2002. Comparisons are made to the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and financial condition at December 31, 2001, which include only the historical results of Amgen. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities The Company had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $4,663.9 million and $2,662.2 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Of the total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2002, approximately $2.0 billion represents cash generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in such foreign operations (see “Results of Operations—Income taxes”). If these funds are repatriated for use in the Company’s U.S. operations, additional taxes on certain of these amounts would be required to be paid. The Company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to the United States. The primary objectives for the Company’s fixed income investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made to achieve the highest rate of return to the Company, consistent with these two objectives. The Company’s investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. Cash flows Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be the Company’s primary recurring source of funds. In 2002, operations provided $2,248.8 million of cash compared with $1,480.2 million in 2001. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2002 resulted primarily from higher earnings, 33 Table of Contents excluding the one-time, non-cash write-off of in-process research and development, and depreciation and amortization. In July 2002, the Company paid the cash portion of the merger consideration of approximately $2.5 billion upon close of the Immunex acquisition. Also as a result of the acquisition, the Company received: — cash and investments acquired from Immunex of approximately $940 million — proceeds from the sale of the Leukine® business to Schering AG Germany (“Schering”) of approximately $390 million Capital expenditures totaled $658.5 million in 2002 compared with $441.8 million in 2001. The increase in capital expenditures in 2002 resulted primarily from capital expenditures related to the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion, the Seattle inflammation research headquarters, and the Rhode Island manufacturing facilities. The Company receives cash from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock by Amgen pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan. Employee stock option exercises and proceeds from the sale of stock by Amgen pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans provided $427.8 million and $277.7 million of cash in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of the Company’s stock relative to the exercise price of such options. The Company has a stock repurchase program primarily to reduce the dilutive effect of its employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2002, the Company repurchased 28.0 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1,420.4 million. In 2001, the Company repurchased 12.7 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $737.5 million. Stock repurchased in 2002 includes 11.3 million shares of common stock repurchased simultaneously with the issuance of the 30-year, zero-coupon senior convertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”, discussed below) at a total cost of $650 million. In June 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $2.0 billion of common stock through June 30, 2004. At the time of the additional authorization, the Company had approximately $257.1 million remaining under the previous authorized stock repurchase program. The amount the Company spends on and the number of shares repurchased varies based on a variety of factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which the Company is restricted from repurchasing shares. As of December 31, 2002, $1,842.1 million was available for stock repurchases through June 30, 2004. Debt financing In March 2002, the Company issued $3.95 billion in aggregate face amount at maturity of Convertible Notes with a yield to maturity of 1.125%. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $2.82 billion. The original issue discount of $1.13 billion is being accreted to interest expense over the life of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs were approximately $56.5 million and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the notes. The holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their notes on March 1, 2005, March 1, 2007, March 1, 2012, and March 1, 2017 at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount to the purchase dates. In such event, the Company may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock (see Note 8, “Debt—Convertible notes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). To provide for financial flexibility and increased liquidity, the Company has established several other sources of debt financing. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $200 million of unsecured long-term debt securities outstanding. These unsecured long-term debt securities consisted of: 1) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.5% and mature in 2007 under a $500 million debt shelf registration (the “Shelf”), and 2) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.1% and mature in 2097. In 34 Table of Contents addition, the Company has $23 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.2% and mature in 2003, which are classified as current liabilities. The Company’s outstanding long-term debt is rated A2 by Moody’s and A+ by Standard & Poor’s. Under the Shelf, all of the remaining $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered under the Company’s medium-term note program with terms to be determined by market conditions. The Company’s sources of debt financing also include a commercial paper program which provides for unsecured short-term borrowings up to an aggregate face amount of $200 million. As of December 31, 2002, commercial paper with a face amount of $100 million was outstanding. These borrowings had maturities of less than one month and had effective interest rates averaging 1.4%. In addition, the Company has an unsecured $150 million committed credit facility with five participating banking institutions that expires on May 28, 2003. This credit facility supports the Company’s commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2002, no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit. Contractual obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities which the Company cannot reasonably predict future payment. The following chart represents the Company’s contractual obligations, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years More than 5 years Medium and long-term notes and commercial paper $ 323.0 $ 123.0 $ — $ 100.0 $ 100.0 Convertible Notes (1) 2,917.8 — 2,917.8 — — Operating lease obligations 135.7 34.7 49.6 23.9 27.5 Unconditional purchase obligations (2) 1,343.4 302.1 530.1 204.5 306.7 Total contractual obligations $ 4,719.9 $ 459.8 $ 3,497.5 $ 328.4 $ 434.2 (1) Holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates as early as March 1, 2005 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount (“accreted value”) through the purchase date. The amount above represents the accreted value on March 1, 2005. The accreted value based on the 30-year contractual maturity is $3,950.0 million. In the event the Company is required to repurchase the notes, it may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock. (2) Unconditional purchase obligations primarily relate to the Company’s long-term supply agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (“BI Pharma”) for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL®. Amounts owed to BI Pharma are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for ENBREL® and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved. The Company’s obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. The Company believes that existing funds, cash generated from operations, and existing sources of debt financing are adequate to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future, as well as to support its stock repurchase program (see “Financial Outlook—Liquidity and capital resources”). However, the Company may raise additional capital from time to time. Results of Operations Product sales Product sales in 2002 primarily consisted of sales of EPOGEN® (Epoetin alfa), Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa), NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim), Neulasta™ (pegfilgrastim), and ENBREL® (etanercept). In 2002, product sales were 35 Table of Contents $4,991.2 million, an increase of $1,480.2 million or 42% over the prior year. This increase was principally driven by Neulasta™, Aranesp®, and ENBREL® sales. Product sales for 2002, excluding sales from products acquired from Immunex, were $4,589.4 million, an increase of $1,078.4 million or 31% over the prior year. Product sales were $3,511.0 million in 2001, an increase of $308.8 million or 10% over the prior year. Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, wholesaler inventory management practices, foreign exchange effects, new product launches, and acquisitions. EPOGEN®/Aranesp® In June 2001, the Company received approval to market Aranesp® in most countries in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure, including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. In September 2001, Amgen received approval in the United States for the same indication. In July 2002, the Company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval to market Aranesp® for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies. In August 2002, the European Commission approved Aranesp® for the treatment of anemia in adult cancer patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy. Aranesp® was launched in several countries in Europe for this indication. Combined EPOGEN® and Aranesp® sales for 2002 were $2,676.2 million, an increase of $526.2 million or 24% over combined 2001 sales. EPOGEN® sales for 2002 were $2,260.6 million, an increase of $152.1 million or 7% over 2001 EPOGEN® sales. The Company believes that EPOGEN® sales growth for 2002 was principally driven by demand, which includes the effect of higher prices and growth in the dialysis patient population. Worldwide Aranesp® sales for 2002 were $415.6 million, including U.S. sales of $284.7 million. The Company believes that worldwide Aranesp® sales for 2002 were driven primarily by demand, and reflect the benefit of receiving the oncology indication in the United States in July 2002. Combined EPOGEN® and Aranesp® sales in 2001 were $2,150.0 million, an increase of $187.1 million or 10% over 2000 EPOGEN® sales. This increase was primarily due to higher EPOGEN® demand, which includes the effect of higher prices and growth in the dialysis patient population, and to a lesser extent, the launch of Aranesp® in the United States and Europe. The reported sales growth was negatively impacted to a slight degree by wholesaler inventory changes. Worldwide Aranesp® sales in 2001 were $41.5 million. NEUPOGEN®/Neulasta™ The Company launched Neulasta™ in the United States in April 2002 to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia. In August 2002, the European Commission approved Neulasta™ for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy. In January 2003, the Company commenced launching Neulasta™ in Europe on a country-by-country basis as reimbursement has been established. Combined Neulasta™ and worldwide NEUPOGEN® sales in 2002 were $1,843.1 million, an increase of $496.7 million or 37%, over NEUPOGEN® only sales in the prior year. The Company believes that the increase in combined sales for Neulasta™ and NEUPOGEN® for 2002 was primarily driven by demand for Neulasta™, which reflects the conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta™ and patient population growth. Combined sales also benefited, to a lesser extent, from wholesaler inventory changes and higher NEUPOGEN® prices in the United States. Neulasta™ sales in 2002 were $463.5 million. Worldwide NEUPOGEN® sales in 2002 were $1,379.6 million, an increase of $33.2 million or 2% over the prior year NEUPOGEN® sales. In 2002, U.S. NEUPOGEN® sales were $1,041.7 million, a decrease of $8.9 million or 1% over 2001 sales. This decrease was 36 Table of Contents primarily due to lower U.S. NEUPOGEN® demand, partially offset by favorable wholesaler inventory changes. The Company believes that U.S. NEUPOGEN® demand declined at a mid-single digit rate from 2001. The decrease in U.S. demand was primarily impacted by the conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta™, partially offset by higher NEUPOGEN® prices in the United States. The Company believes that, as demand for Neulasta™ increased subsequent to its U.S. launch, U.S. NEUPOGEN® demand decreased at an accelerated rate due to the conversion of patients to Neulasta™. In the fourth quarter of 2002, combined Neulasta™ and worldwide NEUPOGEN® sales were $514.0 million, an increase of 53% over worldwide NEUPOGEN® only sales in the prior year period. The Company believes this increase in combined sales was negatively impacted by a decline in U.S. NEUPOGEN® demand in the low-20% range, driven by conversion of patients to Neulasta™ (see “Financial Outlook—Trends expected to impact future operations”). Worldwide NEUPOGEN® sales in 2001 were $1,346.4 million, an increase of $122.7 million or 10% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to worldwide demand growth, which includes the effect of higher prices in the United States. ENBREL® The Company began recording ENBREL® sales on July 16, 2002, subsequent to the close of the Immunex acquisition. For the period from July 16, 2002 through December 31, 2002, ENBREL® sales were $362.1 million. In 2002, ENBREL® sales were impacted by supply constraints. Corporate partner revenues Corporate partner revenues were $200.3 million in 2002, a decrease of $51.7 million or 21% over the prior year. Corporate partner revenues include $174.6 million related to amounts earned from Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (“Kirin-Amgen”) in 2002. The overall decrease in corporate partner revenues was primarily due to lower revenues earned from Kirin-Amgen, and to a lesser extent, lower revenues earned under other collaboration agreements. In 2001, corporate partner revenues were $252.0 million, an increase of $5.8 million or 2% over the prior year. Corporate partner revenues include $210.1 million related to amounts earned from Kirin-Amgen in 2001. The overall increase in corporate partner revenues was due to slightly higher revenues, primarily related to INFERGEN®, substantially offset by lower amounts earned from Kirin-Amgen. Royalty income Substantially all royalty income earned by Amgen relates to amounts received from sales of Epoetin alfa by Johnson & Johnson in the United States for use in non-dialysis settings. Royalty income was $331.5 million in 2002, an increase of $78.8 million or 31% over the prior year. This increase was principally due to higher royalties earned from Johnson & Johnson relating to its sales of Epoetin alfa. In 2001, royalty income was $252.7 million, an increase of $71.7 million or 40% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher royalties from Johnson & Johnson relating to its sales of Epoetin alfa. Cost of sales Cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was 14.7%, 12.6%, and 12.8% for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 was principally due to the impact of higher manufacturing costs and royalty expense related to ENBREL® compared to Amgen’s other products. In addition, during 2002 the Company recorded the inventory acquired from Immunex at its estimated fair market value (see Note 3, “Immunex acquisition” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in fair market value was recognized as cost of sales as the acquired inventory was sold. Cost of sales for 2002 reflects a charge of $38.7 million related to the 37 Table of Contents fair value adjustment to inventory, and $7.5 million of compensation costs payable under the Immunex Corporate Retention Plan. In 2001, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales decreased from 2000 primarily due to reduced royalty obligations, substantially offset by the impact of the $39.5 million write-off of certain inventory in the fourth quarter of 2001. Research and development In 2002, research and development (“R&D”) expenses increased $251.6 million or 29% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher staff-related costs and higher outside R&D costs, and to a lesser extent, higher clinical manufacturing costs as a result of the acquisition. In 2002, staff-related costs and outside R&D costs increased approximately $120 million and $90 million, respectively, excluding the impact of clinical manufacturing activities. In 2002, clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately $38 million. Staff-related costs in 2002 include approximately $18.1 million of compensation costs payable under the Immunex Corporate Retention Plan. In 2001, research and development expenses increased $20.0 million or 2% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher staff-related costs necessary to support ongoing research and product development activities, partially offset by lower clinical manufacturing and product licensing-related costs. Selling, general and administrative In 2002, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased $491.4 million or 51% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher staff-related costs and outside marketing expenses as the Company increased its support for newly launched products and ENBREL®, and to a lesser extent, higher outside services. In 2002, staff-related costs increased approximately $225 million, outside marketing expenses increased approximately $217 million, and other outside services increased approximately $34 million. Staff-related costs increased in 2002 principally to support new product launches, from incremental expenses from the addition of Immunex staff, and approximately $14.8 million of compensation costs principally payable under the Immunex Corporate Retention Plan. Outside marketing expenses in 2002 increased principally due to the launch of new products, marketing costs related to ENBREL®, and the impact of the profit share with Wyeth under the co-promotion agreement (see Note 13, “Agreements with Wyeth” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2001, SG&A expenses increased $143.8 million or 17% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher outside marketing expenses, staff-related costs, and consulting expenses as support for new product launches was increased. In 2001, outside marketing expenses and staff-related costs each increased approximately $60 million and consulting expenses increased approximately $20 million. Acquired in-process research and development In the third quarter of 2002, the Company incurred a one-time expense of $3.0 billion associated with writing off the acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) related to the Immunex acquisition. The amount expensed as IPR&D represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in-process technology for projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model. For each project, the estimated after-tax cash flows were probability weighted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization. These cash flows were then discounted to a present value using discount rates ranging from 12% to 14%. In addition, solely for the 38 Table of Contents purposes of estimating the fair values of these IPR&D projects as of July 15, 2002, the following assumptions were made: — Future R&D costs of $500 million to $600 million per therapeutic area would be incurred to complete the inflammation and the oncology research projects, and future costs of $200 million to $250 million would be incurred to complete all other research projects. These estimates are net of any R&D costs that will be shared under collaborations with corporate partners. — The research projects, which were in various stages of development from pre-clinical through phase 3 clinical trials, are expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from 2003 through 2009. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize, as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from the estimated results. Amortization of intangible assets In 2002, amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition was $155.2 million. Amortization of intangible assets is provided over their estimated useful lives ranging from 7 to 15 years on a straight-line basis. Other items, net In 2002, other items, net consisted of three items: 1) a one-time, non-recurring benefit of $40.1 million related to the recovery of certain expenses accrued in the fourth quarter of 2001 related to terminating collaboration agreements with various third parties, 2) a legal award associated with the product license arbitration with Johnson & Johnson of $151.2 million, and 3) a charitable contribution to the Amgen Foundation of $50 million. In 2001, other items, net primarily consisted of costs associated with the termination of collaboration agreements with various third parties, including PRAECIS PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED and certain academic institutions totaling $203.1 million. In 2000, other items, net consisted of two items: 1) a legal award associated with the spillover arbitration with Johnson & Johnson of $73.9 million, and 2) a charitable contribution to the Amgen Foundation of $25 million. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the 2002, 2001, and 2000 items. Interest and other income, net In 2002, interest and other income, net decreased $24.5 million or 15% over the prior year. This decrease was principally due to higher realized losses related to equity securities and higher losses on foreign currency transactions. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest income generated from the Company’s investment portfolio as a result of higher average cash balances. Higher average cash balances during 2002 offset the impact of lower average interest rates. In 2001, interest and other income, net increased $22.5 million or 15% over the prior year. This increase was due to higher interest income generated from the Company’s investment portfolio as a result of higher average cash balances, partially offset by lower interest rates in 2001 and higher gains on the sale of equity investments that occurred in 2000. 39 Table of Contents Income taxes The Company’s effective tax rate was (103.3%), 33.6%, and 32.0% for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The Company’s negative effective tax rate for 2002 was primarily due to the pre-tax loss resulting from the write-off of IPR&D costs in connection with the Immunex acquisition which is not deductible for income tax purposes. Excluding the effect of the IPR&D write-off, the 2002 effective tax rate would have been 30.7%. This effective tax rate was lower than the 2001 effective tax rate of 33.6% primarily due to the Puerto Rico restructuring described below. During 2002, the Company restructured its Puerto Rico manufacturing operations using a controlled foreign corporation. As permitted in APB Opinion No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” the Company does not provide U.S. income taxes on the controlled foreign corporation’s undistributed earnings that are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. Therefore, the Company’s effective tax rate for 2002 reflected the permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings outside the United States. In addition, the Puerto Rico manufacturing operations were entitled to a possession tax credit for a portion of 2002. This credit is capped based on the 1995 income level and expires in 2005. The higher effective tax rate in 2001 versus 2000 was a result of increased taxable income combined with the cap on the possession tax credit. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. EPOGEN® revenue recognition The Company has the exclusive right to sell Epoetin alfa for dialysis, certain diagnostics, and all non-human, non-research uses in the United States. Amgen has granted to Johnson & Johnson a license relating to Epoetin alfa for sales in the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. Pursuant to this license, the Company and Johnson & Johnson are required to compensate each other for Epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party’s exclusive market, sometimes referred to as “spillover”. Accordingly, Amgen does not recognize product sales it makes into the exclusive market of Johnson & Johnson and does recognize the product sales made by Johnson & Johnson into Amgen’s exclusive market. Sales in Amgen’s exclusive market are derived from the Company’s sales to its customers, as adjusted for spillover. The Company is employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party’s spillover based on independent third-party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage. Data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques, and accordingly, the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover. The Company initially recognizes spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage, utilizing historical third-party data and subsequently adjusts such amounts based on revised third-party data as received. Differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based on revised third-party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized EPOGEN® sales. However, such differences to date have not been material. Immunex purchase price allocation The purchase price for Immunex was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. An independent third-party valuation firm was engaged to assist in determining the fair values of in-process research and development, identifiable intangible assets, and certain property, plant, and equipment. Such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: determining the timing and expected costs to complete 40 Table of Contents the in-process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects, and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. The Company believes the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions. However, these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Additionally, estimates for the purchase price allocation may change as subsequent information becomes available. Deferred income taxes The Company’s effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in international operations based on the Company’s projected cash flow, working capital, and long-term investment requirements of its U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact the Company’s effective future tax rate. Financial Outlook Liquidity and capital resources The Company currently estimates spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in 2003, which reflects higher spending on capital projects including the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion, the Seattle inflammation research headquarters, and the new Rhode Island manufacturing plant, which will be adjacent to the existing manufacturing facility. Results of operations In the future, the Company expects growth of its businesses to be driven by new products, primarily Neulasta™, ENBREL®, and Aranesp® (see “Forward looking statements and factors that may affect Amgen”). EPOGEN® EPOGEN® is approved in the United States for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure. The Company believes EPOGEN® sales growth will come primarily from patient population growth and price increases. Patients receiving treatment for end stage renal disease are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government. The Company believes future EPOGEN® sales growth may also be affected by future changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government. EPOGEN® may compete with Aranesp® in the United States as health care providers may use Aranesp® to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of EPOGEN®. Aranesp® In 2001, Aranesp® was approved in the United States, most countries in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure, including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. In July 2002, Aranesp® was approved in the United States for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies. In August 2002, Aranesp® was approved in Europe for the treatment of anemia in adult cancer patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy. The Company has launched Aranesp® in several European countries and will expand into other countries as reimbursement is finalized. The Company believes future Aranesp® sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: the effects of competitive pressures, penetration of existing and new market opportunities, and changes in foreign 41 Table of Contents currency exchange rates. In addition, future worldwide Aranesp® sales growth may be affected by cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers, as well as the availability of reimbursement by third-party payors, including governments and private insurance plans. For example, effective January 1, 2003, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) instituted certain changes to its payment system that included a rule setting a significantly reduced reimbursement rate for Aranesp® for Medicare patients in the hospital outpatient setting. While we believe that this new rule is based on inaccurate information, we cannot predict whether we will be successful in correcting inaccuracies underlying this rule, or if such reimbursement changes for Aranesp® in this setting may impact reimbursement in other settings, by other payors, or for our other products. The hospital outpatient Medicare setting accounted for approximately 10% of our U.S. revenues of Aranesp® for the year ended December 31, 2002. U.S. sales of Aranesp® for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $284.7 million. NEUPOGEN®/Neulasta™ In January 2002, Neulasta™ was approved in the United States to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia. The Company launched Neulasta™ in the United States in April 2002. In August 2002, Neulasta™ was approved in Europe for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy. In January 2003, the Company commenced launching Neulasta™ in Europe on a country-by-country basis as reimbursement has been established. NEUPOGEN® is approved in the United States to: decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in chemotherapy patients with non-myeloid malignancies (the same use for which Neulasta™ is approved); to reduce the duration of neutropenia for patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation; to reduce the incidence and duration of neutropenia-related consequences in patients with severe chronic neutropenia; for use in mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells for stem cell transplantation; and to reduce the recovery time of neutrophils and the duration of fever following chemotherapy treatment in patients being treated for acute myelogenous leukemia. NEUPOGEN® is approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia for these same indications as well as for the treatment of neutropenia in HIV patients receiving antiviral and/or other myelosuppressive medications. The Company believes future NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta™ sales growth will depend on penetration of existing markets, the conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta™, patient population growth, price increases, the effects of competitive products or therapies, the development of new treatments for cancer, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, future worldwide sales growth may be affected by cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers, as well as the availability of reimbursement by third-party payors, including governments and private insurance plans. Further, chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less NEUPOGEN®/Neulasta™. NEUPOGEN® competes with Neulasta™ in the United States and Europe. The Company believes that U.S. NEUPOGEN® sales have and will continue to be adversely impacted by the launch of Neulasta™, however the Company cannot accurately predict the extent to which healthcare providers will use Neulasta™ instead of NEUPOGEN® or the timing of this conversion. ENBREL® As a result of the Immunex acquisition in July 2002, the Company acquired the rights to ENBREL® in the United States and Canada. ENBREL® is approved in the United States for: the reduction of the signs and symptoms in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”); treating moderately to severely active polyarticular-course juvenile RA in patients who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease modifying antirheumatic drugs; inhibiting the progression of structural damage in patients with moderately to severely active RA; and for reducing the signs and symptoms of active arthritis in patients with 42 Table of Contents psoriatic arthritis. The Company believes that future sales of ENBREL® will depend on: limits on the current supply of and sources of ENBREL®, penetration of existing and new market opportunities, the availability and extent of reimbursement by third-party payors, the effects of competing products or therapies, and any potential adverse developments discovered with respect to ENBREL®’s safety. ENBREL® is currently marketed in the United States and Canada under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth and, accordingly, Wyeth receives a share of the profits from sales of ENBREL®. In late December 2002, the FDA approved the manufacturing facility and the related third-party fill and finish facilities. Because of these plant approvals, additional supply of ENBREL® is available to patients. Trends expected to impact future operations Future operating results of the Company may be impacted by a number of factors. The following trends in our business are expected to impact our future liquidity and results of operations: — combined NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta™ sales are expected to increase; however, U.S. NEUPOGEN® sales are expected to continue to decrease due to conversion of patients to Neulasta™ — cost of sales as a percentage of product sales is expected to continue to increase due to higher manufacturing and royalty expense for ENBREL® — SG&A expenses are expected to continue to be impacted by seasonal trends in the fourth quarter that increase expenses over the three prior quarters — non-cash amortization expense of acquired identifiable intangible assets, principally related to ENBREL®, will be approximately $340 million, pre-tax, on an annual basis Forward looking statements and factors that may affect Amgen This report and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls, and conference calls. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume,” “continue”, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We have based our forward looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied, or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, expenses, earnings per share, liquidity and capital resources, and trends. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or otherwise. The following items are representative of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements. Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payors, and a reduction in the payment rate or reimbursement could result in decreased use or sales of our products. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors such as state and federal governments, under programs such as Medicare 43 Table of Contents and Medicaid in the United States, and private insurance plans. Medicare does not cover prescriptions for ENBREL®. In certain foreign markets, the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls. In the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of state and federal proposals that could limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of drugs. In addition, we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products, which may adversely impact product sales. Further, when a new therapeutic product is approved, the availability of governmental and/or private reimbursement for that product is uncertain, as is the amount for which that product will be reimbursed. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our recently approved products or product candidates, including those at a late stage of development, and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time; we believe that sales of Aranesp® and Neulasta™ are and will be affected by government and private payor reimbursement policies. Effective January 1, 2003, CMS instituted certain changes to its payment system that included a rule setting a significantly reduced reimbursement rate for Aranesp® for Medicare patients in the hospital outpatient setting. While we believe that this new rule is based on inaccurate information, we cannot predict whether we will be successful in correcting inaccuracies underlying this rule, or if such reimbursement changes for Aranesp® in this setting may impact reimbursement in other settings, by other payors or for our other products. If reimbursement for our marketed products changes adversely or if we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement for our other current or future products, health care providers may limit how much or under what circumstances they will administer them, which could reduce the use of our products or cause us to reduce the price of our products. This could result in lower product sales or revenues which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. For example, in the United States the use of EPOGEN® in connection with treatment for end stage renal disease is funded primarily by the U.S. federal government. In early 1997, CMS instituted a reimbursement change for EPOGEN® which materially and adversely affected our EPOGEN® sales until the policies were revised. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval. We conduct research, preclinical testing, and clinical trials and we manufacture and contract manufacture our product candidates. We also manufacture and contract manufacture, price, sell, distribute, and market or co-market our products for their approved indications. These activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, such as the FDA and CMS, as well as in foreign countries, including Europe. Currently, we are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from those countries’ regulatory authorities before we can market and sell our products in those countries. In our experience, obtaining regulatory approval is costly and takes many years, and after it is obtained, it remains costly to maintain. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials, require additional testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval, require changes in labeling of our products and mandate product withdrawals. All of our marketed products are currently approved in the United States and most are approved in Europe and in other foreign countries for specific uses. We currently manufacture and market all our approved products, and we plan to manufacture and market many of our potential products. Even though we have obtained regulatory approval for our marketed products, these products and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, ENBREL® is manufactured both by us at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility and by a third-party contract manufacturer, BI Pharma, and fill and finish of bulk product produced at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility is done by third-party service providers. BI Pharma and these third-party service providers are subject to FDA regulatory authority. See “—Our sources of supply for ENBREL® are limited.” In addition, later discovery of unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers could result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, including potential withdrawal of the products from the market. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers have 44 Table of Contents violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend, or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing or selling our marketed products until we or our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply or indefinitely. In addition, if regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate, then they may not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to market and sell it. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. To date, there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed in such companies’ patents. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates, and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patents that they may claim prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude commercialization of products. We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in patent litigation. For example, we are involved in ongoing patent infringement lawsuits against Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (“TKT”) and Aventis with respect to our erythropoietin patents. If we ultimately lose these or other litigations we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, we could be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology, or we could be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. We have filed applications for a number of patents and have been granted patents or obtained rights relating to erythropoietin, recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, etanercept, and our other products and potential products. We market our erythropoietin, recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, and etanercept products as EPOGEN®, NEUPOGEN®, Aranesp®, Neulasta™, and ENBREL®, respectively. In the United States, we have been issued or obtained rights to several patents relating to erythropoietin that generally cover DNA and host cells, processes for making erythropoietin, various product claims to erythropoietin, cells that make levels of erythropoietin, and pharmaceutical compositions of erythropoietin. We have also been issued or obtained rights to U.S. patents relating to G-CSF that cover aspects of DNA, vectors, cells, processes, polypeptides, methods of treatment using G-CSF polypeptides, methods of enhancing bone marrow transplantation and treating burn wounds, methods for recombinant production of G-CSF, and analogs of G-CSF. We have been issued or obtained rights to U.S. and European patents pertaining to pegfilgrastim (pegylated G-CSF). We also have been granted or obtained rights to a patent in Europe relating to erythropoietin, a patent in Europe relating to G-CSF, two patents in Europe relating to darbepoetin alfa and hyperglycosylated erythropoietic proteins, and a patent in the United States and a patent in Europe relating to anakinra. We have been granted or have obtained rights to patents relating to etanercept in the United States that generally cover DNA (issued in 1995 and 2000); products (issued in 1999 and 2001); and processes for using (issued 1997). These patents have varying expiration dates, with the latest United States etanercept related patent expiring in 2014. We have been granted or have obtained rights to patents relating to etanercept in Europe. The latest European patent relating to etanercept expires in 2011. Limits on supply for ENBREL® may constrain ENBREL® sales. U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL® is impacted by many manufacturing and production variables, such as the timing and actual number of production runs, production success rate, bulk drug yield, and the timing and outcome of product quality testing. For example, in the second quarter of 2002, Immunex Corporation, (the prior 45 Table of Contents owner of ENBREL®), experienced a brief period where no ENBREL® was available to fill patient prescriptions, primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from BI Pharma. Once supply of ENBREL® became available, Immunex resumed filling orders on a first come, first served basis. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of ENBREL® to patients, we may lose patients, physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of ENBREL®, our ENBREL® sales will be adversely affected, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. See “—We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of ENBREL®.” and “—Our sources of supply for ENBREL® are limited.” We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of ENBREL®. We currently manufacture ENBREL® at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility. However, we also depend on third parties for a significant portion of our ENBREL® supply as well as for the fill and finish of ENBREL® that we manufacture. BI Pharma is currently our sole third-party supplier of ENBREL®; accordingly, our U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL® is currently significantly dependent on BI Pharma’s production schedule for ENBREL®. We would be unable to produce ENBREL® in sufficient quantities to substantially offset shortages in BI Pharma’s scheduled production if BI Pharma or other third-party manufacturers used for ENBREL® production were to cease or interrupt production or services or otherwise fail to supply materials, products, or services to us for any reason, including due to labor shortages or disputes, due to regulatory requirements or action, or due to contamination of product lots or product recalls. This in turn could materially reduce our ability to satisfy demand for ENBREL®, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Factors that will affect our actual supply of ENBREL® at any time include, without limitation, the following: — BI Pharma does not produce ENBREL® continuously; rather, it produces the drug through a series of periodic campaigns throughout the year. The amount of commercial inventory available to us at any time depends on a variety of factors, including the timing and actual number of BI Pharma’s production runs, level of production yields and success rates, timing and outcome of product quality testing, and the amount of vialing capacity. — BI Pharma schedules the vialing production runs for ENBREL® in advance, based on the expected timing and yield of bulk drug production runs. Therefore, if BI Pharma realizes production yields beyond expected levels, or provides additional manufacturing capacity of ENBREL®, it may not have sufficient vialing capacity for all of the ENBREL® bulk drug that it produces. As a result, even if we are able to increase our supply of ENBREL® bulk drug, BI Pharma may not be able to fill and finish the extra bulk drug in time to prevent any supply interruptions. In addition, we are dependent on third parties for fill and finish of ENBREL® bulk drug manufactured at our Rhode Island facility. If third-party fill and finish service providers are unable to provide sufficient capacity or otherwise unable to provide services to us, then supply of ENBREL® could be adversely affected. See “—Limits on supply for ENBREL® may constrain ENBREL® sales,” and “—Our sources of supply for ENBREL® are limited.” Our sources of supply for ENBREL® are limited. ENBREL® supply for the United States and Canada is produced by us at our Rhode Island facility and by BI Pharma, currently our sole source third-party supplier. See “—We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of ENBREL®.” In addition, our current plan includes construction of a new large-scale cell culture commercial manufacturing facility at the site of the current Rhode Island manufacturing facility. We have entered into a manufacturing agreement with Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”) to produce ENBREL® at Genentech’s manufacturing facility in South San Francisco, California. The manufacturing facility is subject to FDA approval, which the parties hope to obtain in 2004. Under the terms of the agreement, Genentech will produce ENBREL® through 2005, with an extension through 2006 by mutual agreement. In addition, Wyeth is constructing a new manufacturing facility in Ireland, which is expected to increase the U.S. 46 Table of Contents and Canadian supply of ENBREL®. If additional manufacturing capacity at the Rhode Island site, or pursuant to the Genentech agreement, or if the Ireland manufacturing facility is not completed, or if these manufacturing facilities do not receive FDA approval before we encounter supply constraints, our ENBREL® sales would be restricted which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We face substantial competition, and others may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. For example, ENBREL® competes in certain circumstances with rheumatoid arthritis products marketed by Abbott Laboratories/Knoll, Centocor Inc./Johnson & Johnson, Aventis, Pharmacia, and Merck as well as the generic drug methotrexate and may face competition from potential therapies being developed by Biogen, among others. Further, we believe that some of our newly approved products and late stage product candidates may face competition when and as they are approved and marketed. For example, in the United States, Aranesp® competes with an Epoetin alfa product marketed by Johnson & Johnson in certain anemia markets and Kineret® competes in certain circumstances with rheumatoid arthritis products marketed by Abbott Laboratories/Knoll, Centocor Inc./Johnson & Johnson and others. Additionally, some of our competitors, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, market products or are actively engaged in research and development in areas where we are developing product candidates. Large pharmaceutical corporations may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop, and market new products. Certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components are single-sourced from third parties; third-party supply failures could adversely affect our ability to supply our products. Certain raw materials necessary for commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Also, certain medical devices and components necessary for fill, finish, and packaging of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Certain of these raw materials, medical devices, and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third-party suppliers and, in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the FDA so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the FDA approved that other supplier. We would be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices, or components for an indeterminate period of time if these third-party single suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials or products to us for any reason, including due to regulatory requirements or action, due to adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier, or due to labor shortages or disputes. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and the formulation of our products are derived from biological sources, including bovine serum and human serum albumin, or HSA. We are investigating screening procedures with respect to certain biological sources and alternatives to them. Such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, and/or recall could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This too, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Our product development efforts may not result in commercial products. We intend to continue an aggressive research and development program. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few research and development projects produce a 47 Table of Contents commercial product. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development, such as in early human clinical trials, may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: — the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results — the product candidate was not effective in treating a specified condition or illness — the product candidate had harmful side effects on humans — the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use — the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize — other companies or people have or may have proprietary rights to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all — the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics Several of our product candidates have failed at various stages in the product development process, including Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“BDNF”) and Megakaryocyte Growth and Development Factor (“MGDF”). For example, in 1997, we announced the failure of BDNF for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease, because the product candidate, when administered by injection, did not produce acceptable clinical results for a specific use after a phase 3 trial, even though BDNF had progressed successfully through preclinical and earlier clinical trials. In addition, in 1998, we discontinued development of MGDF, a novel platelet growth factor, at the phase 3 trial stage after several people in platelet donation trials developed low platelet counts and neutralizing antibodies. Of course, there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product. We cannot guarantee we will be able to produce commercially successful products. Further, clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists, medical personnel, regulatory personnel, statisticians, and others which may delay, limit, or prevent further clinical development or regulatory approvals of a product candidate. Also, the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied by product and by the intended use of a product. We expect that this will likely be the case with future product candidates and we cannot predict the length of time to complete necessary clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval. See “—Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval.” We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market. If we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products, and changes to or re-approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required, any of which could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. For example, because ENBREL® has only been marketed since 1998, its long-term effects on the development or course of serious infection, malignancy, and autoimmune disease are largely unknown and more rarely occurring side effects may not be known. In May 1999, Immunex announced an update to the package insert for ENBREL® to advise doctors not to start using ENBREL® in patients who have an active infection, and for doctors to exercise caution when considering using ENBREL® in patients with a history of recurring infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to infections. In October 2000, Immunex again revised the package insert for ENBREL® in response to spontaneous adverse events reported to Immunex, including rare cases of hematologic and central nervous system disorders. The causal relationship between these adverse events and therapy with ENBREL® remains unclear. In January 2001, Immunex revised the package insert for ENBREL® to advise doctors that rare cases of central nervous system disorders, including seizures, and 48 Table of Contents rare cases of tuberculosis have also been reported in patients using ENBREL®. It is possible that additional spontaneous adverse events will be reported to us as experience with ENBREL® continues. If we or others identify new adverse events for patients treated with ENBREL®, additional precautions, warnings, or other changes in the label for ENBREL® may be required. We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims. Product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management’s attention, and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Our operating results may fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause financial results to be below expectations. Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. In budgeting our operating expenses, we assume that revenues will continue to grow; however, some of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term. Because of this, even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period’s results to be below our expectations or projections. A revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors, some of which we cannot control. For example, we may face: — lower than expected demand for our products — inability to provide adequate supply of our products — changes in the government’s or private payors’ reimbursement policies for our products — changes in wholesaler buying patterns — increased competition from new or existing products — fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates — changes in our product pricing strategies Of these, we would only have control over changes in our product pricing strategies and, of course, there may be other factors that affect our revenues in any given period. We plan to grow rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted. We have an aggressive growth plan that includes substantial and increasing investments in research and development, sales and marketing and facilities. Our plan has a number of risks, some of which we cannot control. For example: — we will need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses, and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control — we will need to attract and assimilate a large number of new employees — we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger and faster growing organization — we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity, and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control Of course, there may be other risks and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these or other risks. 49 Table of Contents Our stock price is volatile, which could adversely affect your investment. Our stock price, like that of other biotechnology companies, is highly volatile. For example, in the fifty-two weeks prior to December 31, 2002, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $62.94 per share to a low of $30.57 per share. Our stock price may be affected by such factors as: — clinical trial results — adverse developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products — actual or anticipated product supply constraints — product development announcements by us or our competitors — regulatory matters — announcements in the scientific and research community — intellectual property and legal matters — changes in reimbursement policies or medical practices — broader industry and market trends unrelated to our performance In addition, if our revenues or earnings in any period fail to meet the investment community’s expectations, there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price. Our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations. The development, manufacturing, pricing, sales, and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation. See “—Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval.” and “—We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.” While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on current best practices, we cannot assure you that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, including withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, or other sanctions or litigation. Our marketing of ENBREL® will be dependent in part upon Wyeth. Under the amended and restated co-promotion agreement, we and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL® in the United States and Canada. An ENBREL® management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from us and Wyeth is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL®, including strategic planning, approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing, and establishing an ENBREL® brand team. The ENBREL® brand team, with equal representation from us and Wyeth, will prepare and implement the annual marketing plan and will be responsible for all sales activities. If Wyeth fails to market ENBREL® effectively or if we and Wyeth fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, our sales of ENBREL® may be adversely affected. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to 50 Table of Contents the health care and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration, and use of concomitant therapies. Organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and health care providers could result in decreased use of our products. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use of our products could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our merger with Immunex. On July 15, 2002, we merged with Immunex Corporation. The success of our merger with Immunex will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings, and growth opportunities from integrating the businesses of Immunex with the businesses of Amgen. Our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful integration of the operations of Immunex. The integration of two independent companies is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others: — consolidating research and development and manufacturing operations — retaining key employees — consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures — coordinating sales and marketing functions — preserving ours and Immunex’s research and development, distribution, marketing, promotion, and other important relationships — minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns — coordinating geographically separate organizations In addition, even if we are able to integrate Immunex’s operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the synergies, cost savings, or sales and growth opportunities that we expect or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame. For example, the elimination of significant duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated and the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies. We cannot assure you that the integration of Immunex with us will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us to result from the merger. Our failure to achieve these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest income earned on the Company’s investment portfolio is generally affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements on a portion of its available-for-sale investment portfolio, effectively converting these fixed income investments to variable income investments. The Company’s short-term borrowings bear interest at variable rates and therefore, changes in U.S. interest rates affect interest expense incurred thereon. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the Company’s medium and long-term notes and Convertible Notes because they bear interest at fixed rates. The following tables provide information about the Company’s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For the Company’s investment portfolio and debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Additionally, the Company has assumed its available-for-sale debt securities, comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities, are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes. For the interest rate swaps, the tables present the notional amount and weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity date. The notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract. 51 Table of Contents Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal Amount by Expected Maturity as of December 31, 2002 (Dollars in millions) Average Interest Rate 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total Fair value 12/31/02 Available-for-sale debt securities $ 2,171.3 $ 1,072.8 $ 1,009.9 $ 164.9 $ 29.6 $ 3.0 $ 4,451.5 $ 4,534.7 Interest rate 1.1 % 4.8 % 5.4 % 5.1 % 4.3 % 6.8 % Commercial paper obligations $ 100.0 — — — — — $ 100.0 $ 100.0 Interest rate 1.4 % — — — — — Medium and long-term notes $ 23.0 — — — $ 100.0 $ 100.0 $ 223.0 $ 273.6 Interest rate 6.2 % — — — 6.5 % 8.1 % Convertible Notes (1) — — $ 2,917.8 — — — $ 2,917.8 $ 2,913.5 Interest rate — — 1.125 % — — — Interest rate swaps related to available-for-sale debt securities: Pay fixed/receive variable $ 128.2 $ 80.7 $ 120.0 $ 40.0 — — $ 368.9 $ (14.9 ) Average pay rate 2.9 % 3.9 % 4.2 % 4.5 % — — Average receive rate 1.4 % 1.4 % 1.4 % 1.4 % — — (1) Holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates as early as March 1, 2005 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount (“accreted value”) through the purchase date. The amount above represents the accreted value on March 1, 2005. The accreted value based on the 30-year contractual maturity is $3,950.0 million. In the event the Company is required to repurchase the notes, it may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock. 52 Table of Contents Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal Amount by Expected Maturity as of December 31, 2001 (Dollars in millions) Average Interest Rate 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total Fair value 12/31/01 Available-for-sale debt securities $ 1,466.9 $ 362.9 $ 390.6 $ 163.9 $ 115.0 — $ 2,499.3 $ 2,568.0 Interest rate 4.4 % 6.6 % 5.8 % 7.0 % 5.1 % — Commercial paper obligations $ 100.0 — — — — — $ 100.0 $ 100.0 Interest rate 1.9 % — — — — — Medium and long-term notes — $ 23.0 — — — $ 200.0 $ 223.0 $ 244.9 Interest rate — 6.2 % — — — 7.3 % Interest rate swaps related to available-for-sale debt securities: Pay fixed/receive variable — $ 153.7 $ 144.2 $ 120.0 $ 40.0 — $ 457.9 $ 1.4 Average pay rate — 2.9 % 3.8 % 4.2 % 4.5 % — Average receive rate — 2.0 % 2.0 % 2.0 % 2.0 % — The Company is exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in its portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. In 2001, the Company entered into equity forward contracts to hedge against changes in the fair market value of a portion of its equity investment portfolio. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of the unhedged portion of its equity securities was $82.8 million and $133.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, an adverse change in equity prices of 45% would result in a decrease of approximately $37.3 million and $60.0 million, respectively, in the fair value of the unhedged portion of the Company’s equity securities. Price volatility for equity investments is based on the volatility of a relevant market index for small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology sector. The Company did not have material exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to its foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001.",2023-12-30 18:05:08.763747
318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and previously filed Form 10-K’s for further information regarding our consolidated results of operations and financial position for periods reported therein and for known factors that will impact comparability of future results. (1) In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we incurred restructuring charges of $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $148 million ($111 million, net of tax) and $739 million ($576 million, net of tax), respectively, related primarily to staff separation costs, asset impairment charges, accelerated depreciation (primarily in 2007) and loss accruals for leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our business. (2) In 2008, we completed the acquisition of Dompé Biotec, S.p.A (“Dompé”). The purchase price paid was approximately $168 million, which included the carrying value of our existing 49% ownership in Dompé. In July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Ilypsa, Inc. (“Ilypsa”) for a net purchase price of approximately $400 million. Also in July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Alantos Pharmaceuticals Holding, Inc. (“Alantos”) for a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. In October 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Avidia, Inc. (“Avidia”) for a net purchase price of approximately $275 million. In April 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abgenix for a purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion. (3) Included in cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets) for 2007 is a charge of $30 million related to the write-off of the cost of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that will not be used due to a change in manufacturing strategy. 65 Table of Contents (4) Included in R&D expenses for 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is the ongoing, non-cash amortization of the R&D technology intangible assets acquired with alternative future uses of $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $71 million ($44 million, net of tax) and $48 million ($30 million, net of tax), respectively, acquired with the acquisitions of Avidia and Abgenix in 2006. (5) Primarily represents the non-cash amortization of acquired product technology rights, related primarily to ENBREL, acquired in the Immunex acquisition. Amortization charges, net of tax, for the five years ended December 31, 2010 were $186 million, $186 million, $183 million, $185 million and $200 million, respectively. (6) As part of the accounting for the business combinations of Alantos and Ilypsa in 2007 and Avidia and Abgenix in 2006, under the then existing accounting rules we recorded charges to write-off acquired in-process R&D (“IPR&D”) of $270 million and $320 million in 2007, respectively, and $130 million and $1.1 billion in 2006, respectively. The charges represent the estimated fair values of the IPR&D that, as of the respective acquisition dates, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. (7) In 2010 we incurred an asset impairment charge of $118 million ($74 million, net of tax) associated with a strategic decision to optimize our network of manufacturing facilities. In 2009, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain legal proceedings aggregating $33 million. In 2008, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, related principally to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech Products L.P. (“Ortho Biotech”) antitrust suit. In 2007, we recorded a loss accrual for an ongoing commercial legal proceeding and recorded an expense of $34 million. The remaining amounts included in “Other charges” in 2009, 2008 and 2007, related primarily to charges for cost saving initiatives and restructuring. (See Note 8, Cost savings initiatives and restructuring to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) (8) In 2010, we issued $900 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in October 2020 (the “October 2020 Notes”), $700 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2040 (the “2040 Notes”), $600 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2041 (the “2041 Notes”) and $300 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in March 2020 (the “March 2020 Notes”). In 2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2039 (the “2039 Notes”). In 2009, we repaid our $1.0 billion 4.00% notes. In 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2038 (the “2038 Notes”). In 2008, we repaid our $2.0 billion of floating rate notes. (9) In 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their put option, we repurchased the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes, at their then-accreted value of $1.7 billion. In 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due in 2008, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2017 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2037. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of those notes was used to repurchase shares of our common stock under an accelerated share repurchase program entered into in May 2007. In 2006, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the “2011 Notes”) and $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the “2013 Notes”). In connection with the issuance of those notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also, concurrent with the issuance of those notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The cost of the convertible note hedges, which aggregated approximately $1.5 billion, was recorded as a reduction of equity. Also, concurrent with the issuance of those notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. (10) Throughout the five years ended December 31, 2010, we had share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors through which we repurchased $3.8 billion, $3.2 billion, $2.3 billion, $5.1 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, of Amgen common stock. 66 Table of Contents (11) Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for convertible debt that may be partially or wholly settled in cash. As required by this standard, we retrospectively applied this change in accounting to all prior periods for which we had applicable outstanding convertible debt. Under this method of accounting, the debt and equity components of our convertible notes are bifurcated and accounted for separately. The equity components of our convertible notes, including our 2011 Convertible Notes, 2013 Convertible Notes and zero coupon convertible notes, are included in “Common stock and additional paid-in capital” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding reduction in the carrying values of these convertible notes as of the date of issuance or modification, as applicable. The reduced carrying values of our convertible notes are being accreted back to their principal amounts through the recognition of non-cash interest expense. This results in recognizing interest expense on these borrowings at effective rates approximating what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms. Included in net income for 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is the incremental non-cash interest expense of $266 million ($168 million, net of tax), $250 million ($155 million, net of tax), $235 million ($144 million, net of tax), $168 million ($88 million, net of tax) and $197 million ($141 million, net of tax), respectively, related to the adoption of the new accounting standard. 67 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward looking statements This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume” and “continue,” as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (“EPS”), liquidity and capital resources and trends. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Overview The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). We are the largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We earn revenues and income and generate cash primarily from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products include Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN® and ENBREL, all of which are sold in the United States. ENBREL is marketed under a collaboration agreement with Pfizer in the United States and Canada. Our international product sales consist principally of European sales of Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. For additional information about our products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see Item 1. Business — Marketed Products. Throughout 2010 and early 2011, various developments occurred regarding our business, including regulatory and reimbursement developments associated with certain of our marketed products and product candidates. Most notably, the FDA approved Prolia® and XGEVAtm, and the EC granted marketing authorization for Prolia® for certain indications. In addition, healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States. As a result of these and other developments, we have various opportunities to grow our business but will also continue to face various challenges. The following summarizes certain key opportunities and challenges. We have various opportunities to grow our business. In the near term, we believe the currently approved indications for Prolia® and XGEVAtm represent significant commercial opportunities. In addition, receipt of regulatory approvals in new geographic territories or for additional indications for these products may also provide further significant opportunities. For example, the results of our recently announced phase 3 trial evaluating 68 Table of Contents XGEVAtm versus placebo in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer met its primary endpoint. This study will form the basis of planned marketing applications, which we expect to submit to regulatory authorities beginning in the first half of 2011, for the prevention of bone metastases in prostate cancer. Longer-term growth may also be achieved by the successful development of our late-stage pipeline and strategic business development opportunities, such as our recently announced agreement to acquire BioVex. In addition, longer-term growth may also be achieved by expansion into emerging markets and Japan. Looking forward, we believe our products will continue to face various regulatory, reimbursement and competitive challenges. Our ESA products, in particular, have several near-term challenges that could result in further reductions in sales. For example, EPOGEN® sales will be impacted by the Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis that became effective in 2011. Further, the NCA opened by CMS in June 2010 and the results of the MEDCAC meetings held in March 2010 and January 2011 could lead to an NCD for the use of ESAs in patients with kidney disease, which could impact the use of or reimbursement for ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and/or dialysis-related anemia. In addition, the FDA-approved REMS for ESAs may continue to impact Aranesp® sales in the supportive cancer care setting. Future product label changes (including those we proposed prior to the 2010 CRDAC meeting, any others required in connection with TREAT or the CRDAC meeting and any from the PLR conversion process), may also impact the use of ESAs in CKD. Since we rely in large part on the reimbursement of our products through government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, the recently enacted healthcare reform law has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of our products in the United States and on our results of operations. The provisions of the new legislation impacted our U.S. product sales by approximately $200 million in 2010, and we anticipate that our U.S. product sales in 2011 will be impacted by $250 million to $300 million. Furthermore, we estimate that our results of operations for 2011 will be impacted by an additional $150 million to $200 million related to a new fee on manufacturers and importers of “branded prescription drugs” established by that legislation, which is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Certain of our products will also continue to face increasing competitive pressure, in particular ENBREL in the United States, as well as Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® in Europe as a result of biosimilars. In addition, over the next several years, the existing patents on our principal products will begin to expire, and we expect to face increasing competition thereafter. (See Item 1. Business — Marketed Products.) Certain of these developments are expected to have a material adverse impact on our sales and results of operations. However, these effects may be mitigated by certain of the opportunities we have to grow our business, discussed above, by other strategic initiatives or by increased efforts to manage our expenses. Selected Financial Data The following table presents selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (amounts in millions, except percentages and per share data): 2010 Change 2009 Product sales: U.S. $ 11,254 1% $ 11,135 International 3,406 6% 3,216 Total product sales 14,660 2% 14,351 Other revenues 393 35% 291 Total revenues $ 15,053 3% $ 14,642 Operating expenses $ 9,508 4% $ 9,136 Operating income $ 5,545 1% $ 5,506 Net income $ 4,627 — $ 4,605 Diluted EPS $ 4.79 6% $ 4.51 Diluted shares 965 (5)% 1,021 The following discusses certain key changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 as well as our financial condition as of December 31, 2010. 69 Table of Contents The increase in our U.S. product sales for 2010 reflects overall growth for all of our marketed products, except for our ESA products, which declined 5%. The growth in sales of our non-ESA products reflects increases primarily in average net sales prices and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in wholesaler inventories. U.S. product sales in 2010 were unfavorably impacted by $198 million as a result of the recently enacted U.S. healthcare reform law. The increase in our international product sales for 2010 reflects overall growth for all of our marketed products, except for Aranesp®, which declined 1%. The increase in other revenues for 2010 was due primarily to milestone payments earned from Glaxo in connection with certain commercial milestones for Prolia® in the EU and from Takeda in connection with certain regulatory milestones for Vectibix® in Japan. The increase in operating expenses for 2010 was due principally to higher cost of sales, due primarily to higher bulk manufacturing costs, as well as higher selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses, due primarily to increased promotional costs for Prolia® and our other marketed products. Net income was relatively unchanged in 2010 as the increases in operating income, discussed above, and interest and other income were offset substantially by an increase in our provision for income taxes. The increase in interest and other income was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments and higher interest income. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due principally to reduced benefits resulting from settlements with tax authorities in 2010. The increase in diluted EPS for 2010 principally reflects a reduction in our weighted-average shares used to compute diluted EPS resulting from our stock repurchase program, including approximately 67 million shares repurchased in 2010 at a total cost of $3.8 billion. Although changes in foreign currency rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in the Euro. As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $17.4 billion, and total debt outstanding was $13.4 billion, including $2.5 billion which was repaid in February 2011. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2010, approximately $15.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if those funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. 70 Table of Contents Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Aranesp® $ 2,486 (6) % $ 2,652 (15) % $ 3,137 EPOGEN® 2,524 (2) % 2,569 5 % 2,456 Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® 4,844 4 % 4,643 — 4,659 ENBREL 3,534 1 % 3,493 (3) % 3,598 Sensipar®/Mimpara® 714 10 % 651 9 % 597 Vectibix® 288 24 % 233 52 % 153 Nplate® 229 — 110 — 17 Prolia® 33 — — — — XGEVAtm 8 — — — — Other — — — — 70 Total product sales $ 14,660 2 % $ 14,351 (2) % $ 14,687 Total U.S. $ 11,254 1 % $ 11,135 (3) % $ 11,460 Total International 3,406 6 % 3,216 — 3,227 Total product sales $ 14,660 2 % $ 14,351 (2) % $ 14,687 Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact the sales of certain of our existing products more significantly than others, including, but not necessarily limited to: • our contracting and pricing strategies; • recent and future reimbursement changes resulting from: ¡ governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; ¡ legislative reform in federal, state and foreign jurisdictions; ¡ cost containment pressures; and ¡ the mix of reimbursement from governmental and private payers; • clinical trial outcomes, including adverse events or results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, studies or meta-analyses performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could impact product safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our products, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • changes in clinical practice, including those resulting from the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments; • adoption of and adherence to risk management activities, such as a REMS, undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; • product label changes; • patient population growth; • segment growth and penetration; • new product launches and indications; • expansion into new international markets; 71 Table of Contents • competitive products, including biosimilars; • patent expirations and our ability to obtain and defend our patent and other intellectual property rights; • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; • adequacy of product supply and distribution; • effectiveness of our marketing efforts, including those conducted under collaboration agreements; • concentration of customer purchasing power; and • acquisitions. Our U.S. product sales are also subject to certain other influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and end-user buying patterns (eg, holiday-driven wholesaler and end-user stocking, contract-driven buying and patients purchasing products later in the year after satisfying their annual insurance deductibles). Such factors can result in higher demand for our products and/or higher wholesaler inventory levels and, therefore, higher product sales for a given three-month period, generally followed by a reduction in demand and/or a drawdown in wholesaler inventories and a corresponding decline in product sales in the subsequent three-month period. For example, sales of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 have been slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three-month period, which we believe to be due, in part, to certain of these factors. While this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis, these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended March 31 with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year. In addition, general economic conditions may affect, or in some cases amplify, certain of these factors with a corresponding impact on our product sales. (See Item 1. Business — Marketed Products for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) Aranesp® For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Aranesp® — U.S. $ 1,103 (12 ) % $ 1,251 (24 ) % $ 1,651 Aranesp® — International 1,383 (1 ) % 1,401 (6 ) % 1,486 Total Aranesp® $ 2,486 (6 ) % $ 2,652 (15 ) % $ 3,137 The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for 2010 was due primarily to a decline in unit demand, reflecting an overall decline in the segment. The decrease in international Aranesp® sales for 2010 was due primarily to a decrease in demand. U.S. sales of Aranesp® for 2008 benefited from certain changes in accounting estimates related to product sales return reserves. Excluding the positive impact of these changes in accounting estimates, the decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales of approximately 21% for 2009 was due primarily to a decline in unit demand and a low single-digit percentage point decrease in the average net sales price. The decline in unit demand reflects the negative impact, primarily in the supportive cancer care setting, of a product safety-related label change in August 2008 as well as an overall decline in the segment and a slight loss of segment share. Excluding an $85 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, international Aranesp® sales for 2009 remained unchanged. 72 Table of Contents In addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future Aranesp® sales will depend, in part, on such factors as: • regulatory developments, including: ¡ the REMS for our ESAs approved by the FDA in February 2010; ¡ product label changes, including those proposed prior to the October 2010 CRDAC meeting and any others required in connection with TREAT or the CRDAC meeting, as well as any from the PLR conversion process; • reimbursement developments, including the potential imposition of an NCD or other developments resulting from the NCA opened by CMS in June 2010 and the associated MEDCAC meetings; and • development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. Certain of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp®. See Item 1. Business — Significant Developments, Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors herein for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. EPOGEN® For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 EPOGEN® — U.S. $ 2,524 (2)% $ 2,569 5% $ 2,456 The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for 2010 was due primarily to a decrease in unit demand and certain changes in accounting estimates. The decrease in unit demand reflects a decrease in dose utilization, offset partially by patient population growth. The increase in EPOGEN® sales for 2009 was due primarily to an increase in unit demand and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average net sales price. The increase in unit demand was due principally to patient population growth and increased dose utilization. In addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future EPOGEN® sales will depend, in part, on such factors as: • reimbursement developments, including those resulting from: ¡ CMS’s Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis; ¡ Other CMS activities, including the potential imposition of an NCD or other developments resulting from the NCA opened by CMS in June 2010 and the associated MEDCAC meetings; • regulatory developments, such as those resulting from product label changes, including those proposed prior to the October 2010 CRDAC meeting and any others required in connection with TREAT or the CRDAC meeting, as well as any from the PLR conversion process; • changes in dose fluctuations as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling; and • adoption of alternative therapies or development of new modalities to treat anemia associated with CRF. Certain of the above factors are expected to have a material adverse impact on future sales of EPOGEN®. See Item 1. Business — Significant Developments, Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. 73 Table of Contents Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Neulasta® — U.S. $ 2,654 5% $ 2,527 1% $ 2,505 NEUPOGEN® — U.S. 932 3% 901 1% 896 U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total 3,586 5% 3,428 1% 3,401 Neulasta® — International 904 9% 828 2% 813 NEUPOGEN® — International 354 (9)% 387 (13)% 445 International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total 1,258 4% 1,215 (3)% 1,258 Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® $ 4,844 4% $ 4,643 — $ 4,659 The increase in U.S. sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® for 2010 was driven principally by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in wholesaler inventories. The increase in international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for 2010 reflects primarily growth in Neulasta® principally from the continued conversion from NEUPOGEN® to Neulasta®, offset partially by a decline in NEUPOGEN® as a result of biosimilar competition. The increase in U.S. sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® for 2009 was due primarily to a low single-digit percentage point increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventories. Excluding a $94 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales increased 4% for 2009, due primarily to an increase in demand, reflecting the continued conversion from NEUPOGEN® to Neulasta®. In addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. See Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. ENBREL For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 ENBREL — U.S. $ 3,304 1% $ 3,283 (3)% $ 3,389 ENBREL — Canada 230 10% 210 — 209 Total ENBREL $ 3,534 1% $ 3,493 (3)% $ 3,598 The increase in ENBREL sales for 2010 reflects an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by a low single-digit percentage point decline in unit demand, resulting primarily from share declines in dermatology. ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. The decrease in ENBREL sales for 2009 was due primarily to an unfavorable change in wholesaler inventories resulting from an approximate $100 million wholesaler inventory build in 2008 related to a shift of ENBREL to a wholesaler distribution model and a decline in unit demand as a result of competitive activity, offset partially by a mid single-digit percentage point increase in the average net sales price. See Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. 74 Table of Contents Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in millions): 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Operating expenses: Cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets presented below) $ 2,220 6 % $ 2,091 (9 )% $ 2,296 % of product sales 15.1% 14.6% 15.6% Research and development $ 2,894 1 % $ 2,864 (5 )% $ 3,030 % of product sales 19.7% 20.0% 20.6% Selling, general and administrative $ 3,983 4 % $ 3,820 1 % $ 3,789 % of product sales 27.2% 26.6% 25.8% Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets $ 294 — $ 294 — $ 294 Other charges $ 117 75 % $ 67 (82 )% $ 380 Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, increased to 15.1% of product sales for 2010, driven primarily by higher bulk material costs and higher inventory write-offs due to voluntary EPOGEN®, PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa) and ENBREL recalls. These increases were offset partially by lower excess capacity charges and lower royalties, primarily for ENBREL. Cost of sales decreased to 14.6% of product sales for 2009, driven primarily by lower excess capacity charges, lower excess inventory write-offs, due primarily to the $84 million write-off of inventory in 2008 resulting from a strategic decision to change manufacturing processes, and lower royalty expenses. These decreases were offset partially by less favorable product mix and higher fill and finish costs resulting from lower utilization at our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. Research and development R&D costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems’ costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses include costs incurred under R&D arrangements with our corporate partners, such as activities performed on behalf of KA, and costs and cost recoveries associated with collaborative R&D and in-licensing arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to collaboration partners in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&D costs for arrangements with our corporate partners is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. The increase in R&D expenses for 2010 was driven primarily by $110 million of lower expense recoveries associated with ongoing collaborations and higher staff-related costs of $84 million. These increases were offset largely by lower licensing fees of $115 million, associated principally with payments made in 2009 under the Cytokinetics and Array BioPharma Inc. (“Array”) agreements, and reduced denosumab clinical trial costs of $73 million in 2010. The decrease in R&D expenses for 2009 was driven primarily by lower clinical trial costs of $128 million, including those associated with our denosumab and Vectibix® registrational studies, our marketed products and the delay of the phase 3 motesanib NSCLC trial, and $14 million lower staff-related costs. The higher licensing fees incurred in 2009, which were related to the $60 million expense associated with the Array agreement and the $50 million expense resulting from the payment to Cytokinetics, were offset substantially by the $100 million expense in 2008 resulting from the upfront payment associated with the Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. collaboration. 75 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative SG&A expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&A costs for collaborations is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. In connection with a collaboration agreement, we and Pfizer market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada, and Pfizer is paid a share of the related profits, as defined. The share of ENBREL’s profits owed to Pfizer is included in SG&A expenses. The increase in SG&A expenses for 2010 was due primarily to higher promotional costs for Prolia® and other marketed products of $148 million, higher staff-related costs of $46 million and higher litigation expenses of $45 million, offset partially by charges of $29 million in 2009 for certain cost savings initiatives related to our 2007 restructuring plan. The increase in SG&A expenses for 2009 was due primarily to higher product promotional expenses of $207 million, including increased spending for activities in anticipation of the launch of Prolia®. This increase was offset substantially by lower litigation expenses of $38 million, lower expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share of $32 million, expense recoveries associated with our Glaxo collaboration agreement for Prolia® in PMO in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico of $29 million, lower staff-related costs of $28 million, lower global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system related expenses of $28 million and lower restructuring and related costs of $8 million. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the expense associated with the ENBREL profit share was $1,184 million, $1,163 million and $1,195 million, respectively. Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets relates to products technology rights acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition. Other charges In 2010, we recorded a $118 million asset impairment charge for our manufacturing operations located in Fremont, California, associated with our continuing efforts to optimize our network of manufacturing facilities and improve cost efficiencies. In 2009, the Company recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain legal proceedings aggregating $33 million. In 2008, the Company recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, related principally to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech antitrust suit. Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes The following table presents non-operating expenses/income and the provisions for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense, net $ 604 $ 578 $ 551 Interest and other income, net $ 376 $ 276 $ 352 Provisions for income taxes $ 690 $ 599 $ 963 Effective tax rate 13.0% 11.5% 19.2% 76 Table of Contents Interest expense, net Included in interest expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $266 million, $250 million and $235 million, respectively, resulting from the change in the accounting for our convertible debt effective January 1, 2009. Interest and other income, net The increase in interest and other income, net for 2010 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments of $48 million and higher interest income of $51 million, due principally to higher average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. The decrease in interest and other income, net for 2009 was due primarily to: lower interest income of $45 million, due principally to lower portfolio investment returns; lower net gains on sales of investments of $28 million; and higher losses on certain leased facilities that will no longer be used in our operations of $31 million; offset partially by higher foreign currency exchange net gains of $27 million. Income taxes The increase in our effective tax rate for 2010 was due primarily to: the incremental favorable impact resulting from the resolution of certain prior years’ matters with tax authorities in 2009 compared to 2010; the unfavorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix in 2010; and the tax impact from adjustments to deferred taxes arising from changes in California tax law enacted in 2009 and effective for subsequent periods. The resolution of prior years’ tax matters recognized in 2010 and 2009 reduced the effective tax rate by 3.1% and 4.2%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2009 was due principally to: the favorable resolution of certain income tax examinations; higher profits and manufacturing in Puerto Rico, which are taxed under an incentive grant; and a tax benefit from adjustments to previously established deferred taxes arising from changes in California tax law enacted in 2009. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. (See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies — Income taxes and Note 4, Income taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Recent accounting pronouncements In January 2010, we adopted a newly issued accounting standard which requires additional disclosure about the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy discussed in Note 17, Fair value measurement. This standard also clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring Level 2 and Level 3 measurements. In addition, effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010, this standard requires additional disclosure and requires an entity to present disaggregated information about activity for Level 3 fair value measurements on a gross as opposed to a net basis. As this accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure, its adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2011, we adopted a newly issued accounting standard which addresses the accounting for the annual fee due from the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry beginning January 1, 2011, mandated by the PPACA and the companion Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which made certain changes and adjustments to PPACA. We refer to these two laws collectively as the “new healthcare reform law.” The new healthcare reform law obligates a pharmaceutical manufacturer, upon the first gross receipt during a calendar year from prescription drug sales under any specified government program, to pay an annual fee to the U.S. government. The new accounting standard requires the liability for the annual fee to be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost established that is to be amortized and recognized as an operating expense over 77 Table of Contents the calendar year that it is payable using a straight-line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee. We have elected to amortize this fee on a straight-line basis and it will be recorded in SG&A expense. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): 2010 2009 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 17,422 $ 13,442 Total assets 43,486 39,629 Current debt 2,488 — Non-current debt 10,874 10,601 Stockholders’ equity 23,944 22,667 We believe existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to opportunistically pursue our stock repurchase program and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sale of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other debt markets and equity markets. In February 2011, our 2011 Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $2.5 billion were repaid in full. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business.) Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2010, approximately $15.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. 78 Table of Contents Financing arrangements The following table reflects the carrying value of our long-term borrowings under our various financing arrangements as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in millions): 2010 2009 0.125% convertible notes due 2011 (2011 Convertible Notes) $ 2,488 $ 2,342 0.375% convertible notes due 2013 (2013 Convertible Notes) 2,213 2,088 5.85% notes due 2017 (2017 Notes) 1,099 1,099 4.85% notes due 2014 (2014 Notes) 1,000 1,000 5.70% notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) 998 998 6.40% notes due 2039 (2039 Notes) 996 995 6.375% notes due 2037 (2037 Notes) 899 899 3.45% notes due October 2020 (October 2020 Notes) 897 — 5.75% notes due 2040 (2040 Notes) 696 — 4.95% notes due 2041 (2041 Notes) 595 — 6.15% notes due 2018 (2018 Notes) 499 499 6.90% notes due 2038 (2038 Notes) 499 499 4.50% notes due March 2020 (March 2020 Notes) 300 — Other notes 183 182 Total borrowings 13,362 10,601 Less current portion (2,488 ) — Total non-current debt $ 10,874 $ 10,601 We issued debt securities in various offerings during the three years ended December 31, 2010, including: in 2010, $300 million principal amount of March 2020 Notes, $700 million principal amount of 2040 Notes, $900 million principal amount of October 2020 Notes and $600 million principal amount of 2041 Notes; in 2009, $1.0 billion principal amount of 2019 Notes and $1.0 billion principal amount of 2039 Notes; and in 2008, $500 million principal amount of 2018 Notes and $500 million principal amount of 2038 Notes. Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with these debt offerings totaled $17 million, $13 million and $6 million for debt issued in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are being amortized over the respective lives of the notes. All of these debt issuances as well as the 2017 Notes and the 2037 Notes may be redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest and a “make-whole” amount, as defined. In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a portion of these debt issuances at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. In 2009, we repaid $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.00% and in 2008, we repaid $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) based notes. See Note 15, Financing arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our Convertible Notes. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap agreements qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The effective rates on these swaps range from LIBOR plus 0.3% to LIBOR plus 2.6%. See Note 15, Financing arrangements and Note 18, Derivative instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap agreements. 79 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2010, we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.3 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2010, we have a $2.3 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit facility that matures in November 2012 and is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. Annual commitment fees for this facility are 0.05% based on our current credit rating. As of December 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. We have filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which allows us to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units and depository shares. Under this registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration expires in April 2011. As of December 31, 2010, we have $400 million remaining under a shelf registration statement that was established in 1997. In connection with this shelf registration, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2010, no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2010. None of our financing arrangements contain any financial covenants. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,787 $ 6,336 $ 5,988 Net cash used in investing activities (4,152 ) (3,202 ) (3,165 ) Net cash used in financing activities (1,232 ) (2,024 ) (3,073 ) Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during 2010 decreased due primarily to the timing and amount of payments to taxing authorities. Cash provided by operating activities during 2009 increased due primarily to higher net income of $553 million and a higher dividend payment from KA of $102 million, offset partially by the prior-year receipt of $300 million for an upfront milestone payment related to our licensing agreement with Takeda, and the negative impact of the timing and amounts of receipts from customers and payments to vendors and others. Investing Net purchases of marketable securities were $3.5 billion for 2010 compared to net purchases of $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures totaled $580 million, $530 million and $672 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2010 and 2009 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. Capital expenditures in 2008 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico, Fremont and other site developments and with investment in our global ERP system and other information systems’ projects. We currently estimate 2011 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $600 million. 80 Table of Contents Financing In December 2009, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock of which a total of $2.2 billion remains available as of December 31, 2010. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors, including stock price, blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares and the impact of repurchases on our credit rating, and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. A summary of our repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars First quarter 29.1 $ 1,684 37.5 $ 1,997 — $ — Second quarter 10.3 616 — — 32.7 1,549 (1) Third quarter 6.6 364 — — — 19 (1) Fourth quarter 20.5 1,136 21.7 1,211 12.6 700 Total 66.5 $ 3,800 59.2 $ 3,208 45.3 $ 2,268 (1) The total cost of shares repurchased during the three months ended June 30, 2008 excludes approximately $19 million paid in July 2008 in connection with the final settlement of an accelerated share repurchase program entered into in May 2008. As discussed above, we issued debt securities in various offerings that resulted in net proceeds of $2.5 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, we repaid $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion of notes in 2009 and 2008, respectively. We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options. Employee stock option exercises provided $80 million, $171 million and $155 million of cash in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. 81 Table of Contents The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period Year Years Years Years Contractual obligations Total 1 2 and 3 4 and 5 6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 22,259 $ 2,900 $ 3,389 $ 1,892 $ 14,078 Operating lease obligations 1,009 140 246 189 434 Purchase obligations(2) 3,263 1,020 560 131 1,552 Unrecognized tax benefits(3) 200 200 — — — Total contractual obligations $ 26,731 $ 4,260 $ 4,195 $ 2,212 $ 16,064 (1) The long-term debt obligation amounts include future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2010 to compute the net amounts to be included in the table above for future interest payments on our variable rate interest rate swaps. See Note 15, Financing arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations and our interest swap agreements. (2) Purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. (3) Long-term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (“UTBs”) (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $625 million at December 31, 2010 are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. In addition to the above table, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones in conjunction with collaborative agreements we have entered into with third parties. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above or recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2010, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future under all such arrangements is approximately $2.1 billion. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales, sales deductions and returns Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, “sales deductions”) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to 82 Table of Contents reflect actual results. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in “Accrued liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions (in millions): Cash Other Rebates Chargebacks discounts deductions Total Balance as of January 1, 2008 $ 755 $ 70 $ 42 $ 197 $ 1,064 Amounts charged against product sales 1,813 1,635 324 466 4,238 Payments (2,064 ) (1,621 ) (323 ) (418 ) (4,426 ) Balance as of December 31, 2008 504 84 43 245 876 Amounts charged against product sales 1,497 2,424 312 406 4,639 Payments (1,482 ) (2,380 ) (328 ) (355 ) (4,545 ) Balance as of December 31, 2009 519 128 27 296 970 Amounts charged against product sales 1,522 2,593 347 572 5,034 Payments (1,525 ) (2,548 ) (345 ) (442 ) (4,860 ) Balance as of December 31, 2010 $ 516 $ 173 $ 29 $ 426 $ 1,144 For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total sales deductions were 25%, 24% and 22% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales for 2010 and 2009 and less than 2% for 2008. In late 2008, we began shifting our discount structure as a component of broader contracting revisions to be more heavily weighted toward fixed prices to healthcare providers (reflected as chargebacks in the table above) instead of rebates, resulting in a corresponding reduction in rebates and an increase in chargebacks, as noted in the table above. In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates primarily include amounts paid to payers in the United States and are based on contractual arrangements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. We estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid based on the product sold, contractual terms, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We adjust the accrual as more information becomes available and to reflect actual experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which could take up to one year. Those rebates totaled $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on our recent experience, changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than 2% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for 2010 and 2009 and less than 3.5% for 2008. These changes in annual estimates relate substantially to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period. A 2% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2010 would have had an impact of approximately $30 million on our 2010 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers 83 Table of Contents purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices it pays us and the prices it charges the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Those chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $2.6 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Included in other deductions in the table above are rebates and discounts paid to state Medicaid offices to participate in the Medicaid program. In 2010, healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States which has and will continue to significantly increase our Medicaid rebates and discounts. Certain provisions of this new legislation became effective in 2010, while others will become effective in later years. The provisions of this new legislation reduced our U.S. product sales in 2010 by approximately $200 million, and we anticipate that our U.S. product sales in 2011 will be negatively impacted by $250 million to $300 million by this legislation. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have been insignificant, amounting to less than 1.5% of gross product sales. Furthermore, changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant. Inventories produced in preparation for product launches The Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches when the related product candidates are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. In connection with the decision to capitalize such inventory, we evaluate among other factors any identified risks or concerns with respect to the product candidate’s safety and efficacy, the status of related discussions with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial success, including the existence of current or anticipated competitive products and any reimbursement concerns. In addition, we evaluate any risks associated with the manufacturing of the product candidate as well as consider the remaining shelf life of the inventory in relation to the expected launch date. Upon capitalization, we continue to monitor any changes in these factors. In the event of any significant negative developments, we may be required to impair previously capitalized costs. At December 31, 2009, we had capitalized approximately $258 million of inventory costs related to our then late-stage product candidate, denosumab. During 2010, we received various approvals for denosumab from regulatory authorities in the United States, the EU and various other countries and commenced selling the product in certain geographic markets. Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. 84 Table of Contents Certain items are included in the Company’s tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements. Such timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) a tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; or (ii) an expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable U.S. and state marginal income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. For example, substantial reform of U.S. tax law regarding tax on certain foreign profits could result in an increase in our effective tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 19, Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items, one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits, requiring letters of credit and obtaining credit insurance, as we deem appropriate. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer. We also enter into various types of foreign exchange and interest rate derivative hedging transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In the capital and credit markets, strong demand for fixed income led to historically low interest rates on corporate debt issuances during 2010. Short-term interest rates on U.S. Treasury instruments continued to decline as a result of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, which included a program to buy back U.S. Treasury instruments. As a result, in the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Continued uncertainty surrounding European sovereign debt resulted in ongoing volatility in the foreign exchange markets, and we have consequentially assumed a hypothetical 85 Table of Contents 20% change in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our investment portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was comprised of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government obligations; corporate debt securities; mortgage and asset backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair value of our investment portfolio of debt securities was $17.3 billion and $13.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010 and 2009, would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2010 and 2009 would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2010 we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $13.4 billion and a fair value of $14.5 billion. As of December 31, 2009 we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $10.6 billion and a fair value of $11.6 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2010 would have resulted in an increase of approximately $1.0 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2009 would have resulted in an increase of approximately $760 million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements, which qualify and have been designated as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed rate debt with notional amounts totaling $3.6 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These derivative contracts effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2010 and 2009, would have resulted in a $213 million and $78 million, respectively, reduction in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. Foreign currency sensitive instruments Our operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately the Euro, as a result of the sale of our products in foreign markets. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2010 we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily Euro based, with notional amounts of $3.2 billion and $398 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009 we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily Euro based, with notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $376 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010 the net unrealized gains and at December 31, 2009 the net unrealized losses on these contracts were not material. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2010, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2010 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately 86 Table of Contents $670 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $330 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2009 a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2009 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $720 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $330 million. Also at December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $670 million and $414 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2010 and 2009. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2010 and 2009, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2010 and 2009, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts on these dates of $134 million and $83 million, respectively, and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions or on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market price sensitive instruments As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. We attempt to mitigate that risk through credit monitoring procedures.",2023-12-30 18:05:22.979853
318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2005,"Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward looking statements This report and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls, and conference calls. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume,” “continue,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in “Factors That May Affect Amgen”. We have based our forward looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied, or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share, liquidity and capital resources, and trends. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or otherwise. Overview The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We are a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. As a science-based, patient-focused organization, we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat serious illness. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of nephrology, supportive cancer care, and inflammatory disease. For the year ended December 31, 2004, total revenues were $10,550 million and net income was $2,363 million, or $1.81 per share. As of December 31, 2004, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $5,808 million. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, product sales represented 95%, 94%, and 90% of total revenues, respectively. Over the last two years, our product sales growth has been primarily driven by sales of Aranesp®, ENBREL®, and Neulasta®, which benefited from market share gains and/or market growth. We expect these products to continue to drive sales growth in the near term. Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications, excluding ENBREL®, are covered by both government and private payers health care programs. Therefore, our product sales are and will be affected by government and private payer reimbursement policies. Reduction in reimbursement could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, the MMA was enacted into law in December 2003. We expect that, beginning in 28 Table of Contents 2005, reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA are likely, to a degree, to negatively affect product sales of some of our marketed products. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see “Reimbursement” in “Item 1. Business”. Although we have achieved market share gains during 2004, we expect that continued gains will be a challenge as we operate in a highly competitive environment. Going forward, we expect to continue to focus on market share gains, but we also expect to increase our focus on growing the market. See “Competition” in “Item 1. Business” for further information on the impact of competition on our business. International product sales for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 represented 17%, 14%, and 10% of total product sales and consisted principally of European sales. International product sales have grown substantially since 2002 as a result of the launches of Aranesp®and Neulasta® and continued market penetration. International product sales grew 54% during 2004 and 123% during 2003. Our international sales are impacted by foreign currency changes (see “Results of Operations” discussion below). International product sales growth during 2004 and 2003 benefited by $164 million and $166 million, respectively, from foreign currency exchange rate changes. However, both positive and negative impacts from movements in foreign exchange rates have been mitigated by the natural, opposite impact to our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our net income. As such, the impact to our results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated. For 2004, operating income increased $257 million primarily as a result of our product sales growth. Operating income as a percentage of product sales was 34% for 2004 compared to 39% for 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the 2004 IPR&D charge of $554 million relating to the acquisition of Tularik. During 2004, we increased our operating expenses to support our product sales growth and to invest in R&D to advance our product pipeline. In 2005, our operating expenses are expected to further increase in support of our anticipated product sales growth, and as a result of our continued investment in R&D to advance our pipeline. We focus our R&D efforts on human therapeutics delivered in the form of proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and small molecules in the areas of oncology, inflammation, metabolic disorders, neuroscience, and general medicine. We focus on the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness. We take a modality-independent approach to R&D — that is, we identify targets, then choose the modality best suited to address a specific target. To enhance our internal R&D efforts, we have acquired and licensed certain product and technology rights and have established R&D collaborations. On August 13, 2004, we acquired Tularik at a purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion in a transaction accounted for as a business combination. Tularik was a company engaged in drug discovery related to cell signaling and the control of gene expression. In connection with the Tularik acquisition, we incurred a charge of $554 million associated with writing off the fair value of IPR&D acquired (see Note 7, “Acquisitions” in the consolidated financial statements). The IPR&D write-off represents the estimated fair value of the various acquired R&D projects in Tularik’s pipeline that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. See “Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates” in “Item 1. Business” for further information on our product pipeline. We expect to continue to invest significantly in R&D. There are many economic and industry-wide factors that affect our business, including, among others, those relating to broad reimbursement changes, increased complexity and cost of R&D, increasingly intense competition for our currently marketed products and product candidates, complex and expanding regulatory requirements, and intellectual property protection. See “Item 1. Business” and “Factors That May Affect Amgen” for further information on these economic and industry-wide factors and their impact on our business. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, total product sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Total U.S. $ 8,279 22 % $ 6,764 50 % $ 4,497 Total International 1,698 54 % 1,104 123 % 494 Total product sales $ 9,977 27 % $ 7,868 58 % $ 4,991 See “Principal Products” in “Item 1. Business” for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications. Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, pricing strategies, wholesaler inventory management practices, foreign currency exchange effects, new product launches and indications, competitive products, product supply, and acquisitions. Sales growth in 2004 was principally driven by demand for Aranesp®, ENBREL®, and Neulasta®. U.S. sales for Aranesp® and Neulasta® were impacted by higher incentives earned by customers under performance-based contracts. International product sales growth benefited by $164 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. In the near term, we expect sales growth to continue to be driven primarily by Aranesp®, ENBREL®, and Neulasta®. We believe that changes in reimbursement for our products are likely to adversely affect, to a degree, the prescription and administration of our products by healthcare providers, impacting sequential sales growth and historical sales trends. In prior years, certain of our products have reported sales in the first quarter that were comparable or slightly less than reported sales in the fourth quarter of the previous year. However, due to the uncertainties surrounding the impact of reimbursement, we are unsure that such historical sales trends will continue. EPOGEN®/ Aranesp® For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, total EPOGEN® and Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 EPOGEN® — U.S. $ 2,601 7 % $ 2,435 8 % $ 2,261 Aranesp® — U.S. 1,533 56 % 980 244 % 285 Aranesp® — International 940 67 % 564 331 % 131 Aranesp® — Total 2,473 60 % 1,544 271 % 416 Total EPOGEN® and Aranesp® $ 5,074 28 % $ 3,979 49 % $ 2,677 The increases in combined EPOGEN® and worldwide Aranesp® sales for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were primarily driven by worldwide demand for Aranesp®. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2003 reflects the mid-year 2002 approval of Aranesp® for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in the United States and Europe. The growth in reported EPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily driven by demand, which reflects dialysis patient population growth and a continued focus in the renal community on patient outcomes, and to a lesser extent, increases in wholesaler inventory levels. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the growth in reported EPOGEN® sales was primarily due to demand, and to a lesser extent, spillover (See “Summary of Critical Accounting Policies — EPOGEN® revenue recognition” and Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies — Product sales” to the consolidated financial statements). Demand was driven by growth in the dialysis patient population and improved patient outcomes. 30 Table of Contents Patients receiving treatment for anemia associated with end stage renal disease with EPOGEN® are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government. We believe EPOGEN® sales growth will primarily depend on dialysis patient population growth and changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government (see “Factors That May Affect Amgen — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”). We believe EPOGEN® sales growth will also be dependent, in part, on future governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products and cost containment pressures from the federal government on health care providers. Further, EPOGEN® competes to a slight degree with Aranesp® in the United States as some health care providers use Aranesp® to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of EPOGEN®. To the extent that future Aranesp® sales in the United States are impacted by the effects of reimbursement and pricing strategies (see Aranesp® below), we would expect further competition between EPOGEN® and Aranesp® for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure for patients who are on dialysis. The increase in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was driven by demand, which benefited from market share gains in both oncology and nephrology and market growth. Sales growth was impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. The increase in international Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was principally driven by demand, and to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International Aranesp® sales growth for 2004 benefited by $92 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. The increase in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 was principally driven by demand, reflecting the mid-year 2002 launch of Aranesp® for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in the United States. The increase in international Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 was principally driven by demand, reflecting the mid-year 2002 launch of Aranesp® for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in Europe, and to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International Aranesp® sales growth for 2003 benefited by $87 million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe future worldwide Aranesp® sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: reimbursement by third party payers (including governments and private insurance plans) (see “Factors That May Affect Amgen — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”); cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; penetration of new and existing markets; patient population growth; the effects of pricing strategies; competitive products or therapies, including follow-on biologic products in Europe; the development of new treatments for cancer; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Neulasta®/ NEUPOGEN® For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, total Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Neulasta® — U.S. $ 1,476 26 % $ 1,175 153 % $ 464 Neulasta® — International 264 230 % 80 N/A — Neulasta® — Total $ 1,740 39 % $ 1,255 170 % $ 464 NEUPOGEN® — U.S. 778 (12 )% 881 (15 )% 1,042 NEUPOGEN® — International 397 3 % 386 14 % 338 NEUPOGEN® — Total 1,175 (7 )% 1,267 (8 )% 1,380 Total Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® $ 2,915 16 % $ 2,522 37 % $ 1,844 31 Table of Contents The increase in combined worldwide Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® sales for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was driven by worldwide demand for Neulasta®. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2003 reflects the April 2002 launch of Neulasta®. The increase in U.S. Neulasta® sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily driven by demand, which benefited from new clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use. Sales growth was impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. The increase in international Neulasta® sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to demand, which reflects continued market penetration since the January 2003 launch of Neulasta® in Europe, and to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International Neulasta® sales growth for 2004 benefited by $27 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. The increase in U.S. Neulasta® sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily driven by U.S. demand, which reflects the conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta®resulting from the April 2002 Neulasta® launch. International Neulasta® sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 reflect the January 2003 launch of Neulasta® in Europe. The decrease in U.S. NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to a decline in demand. The increase in international NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by a decline in demand. International NEUPOGEN® sales growth for 2004 benefited by $38 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. Both the United States and international decreases in demand reflect the conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta®. The decrease in NEUPOGEN® sales in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2003 was principally due to the conversion of patients from NEUPOGEN® to Neulasta®. The increase in international NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 was entirely due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe future worldwide Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: reimbursement by third-party payers (including governments and private insurance plans) (see “Factors That May Affect Amgen — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”); cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; penetration of existing markets; patient population growth; the effects of pricing strategies; competitive products or therapies, including follow-on biologic products in Europe; the development of new treatments for cancer; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Future chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less Neulasta®/ NEUPOGEN®, however, other future chemotherapy treatments that are more myelosuppressive, such as dose dense chemotherapy, could require more Neulasta®/ NEUPOGEN®. NEUPOGEN® competes with Neulasta® in the United States and Europe. U.S. NEUPOGEN® sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta®. However, we believe that most of the conversion in the United States has occurred. We believe that we are experiencing conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta® in Europe, but we believe that this conversion will occur to a lesser extent than that experienced in the United States. However, we cannot accurately predict the rate or timing of future conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta® in Europe. ENBREL® For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, total ENBREL® sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 ENBREL® — U.S. $ 1,827 46 % $ 1,254 262 % $ 346 ENBREL® — International 73 59 % 46 188 % 16 Total ENBREL® $ 1,900 46 % $ 1,300 259 % $ 362 32 Table of Contents ENBREL® sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2004 was driven by demand, benefiting from ENBREL®’s competitive profile and significant growth of biologics in the rheumatology and dermatology markets. In the dermatology market, ENBREL® has grown significantly since its approval for moderate to severe psoriasis in April of 2004 and has become the number one prescribed systemic therapy in this market. ENBREL® sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 were primarily driven by the addition of new patients in both rheumatology and dermatology. The increase from the prior year reflects that we only recorded ENBREL® sales beginning on July 16, 2002, subsequent to the close of the Immunex acquisition. These sales were adversely impacted by supply constraints. We believe that future ENBREL® sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: the effects of competing products or therapies; penetration of existing and new markets, including potential new indications; the availability and extent of reimbursement by government and third-party payers; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products (see “Factors That May Affect Amgen — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products”); and limits on the current supply of and sources of ENBREL®. Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes selected operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 (amounts in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Product sales $ 9,977 $ 7,868 $ 4,991 Operating expenses: Cost of sales (excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets) $ 1,731 $ 1,341 $ 736 % of product sales 17 % 17 % 15 % Research and development $ 2,028 $ 1,655 $ 1,117 % of product sales 20 % 21 % 22 % Write-off of acquired in-process research and development $ 554 $ — $ 2,992 Selling, general and administrative $ 2,556 $ 1,957 $ 1,449 % of product sales 26 % 25 % 29 % Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets (see “Consolidated Statements of Operations”), increased 29% for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily driven by higher sales volumes, and to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs due to changes in the product mix. In 2005, we expect cost of sales to be affected by further product mix changes, including the impact of higher ENBREL® sales as it has significantly higher manufacturing costs and royalty expenses as compared to our other principal products. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 82% over the prior year, primarily due to higher sales. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of product sales in 2003 primarily reflects an increase of ENBREL® sales as a percentage of total product sales. ENBREL® has significantly higher manufacturing costs and royalty expense compared to our other products. Additionally, the manufacturing costs of the Rhode Island production facility, which began producing in December 2002, are greater than those of our contract manufacturer, BI Pharma. Research and development R&D expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with R&D personnel, overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services, and other outside costs. R&D expenses increased 23% for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily driven by higher staff-related costs including the addition of R&D personnel from Tularik, and to a lesser extent, higher costs relating to clinical manufacturing and key clinical trials costs, including the commencement of large-scale 33 Table of Contents phase 3 trials for AMG 162, Amgen’s investigational therapy for bone loss. In 2004, staff-related costs and clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs increased approximately $233 million and $122 million, respectively. In 2005, we expect our R&D expenses to increase primarily due to higher clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs to support our development efforts for AMG 162 and Aranesp® (TREAT) (see “Item 1. Business — Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates”). In 2003, R&D expenses increased 48% over the prior year, primarily due to higher outside R&D costs, principally licensing and milestone fees which include the Biovitrum AB up-front fee of $87 million, higher staff-related costs, and higher clinical manufacturing costs. In 2003, outside R&D costs, staff-related costs and clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately $252 million, $163 million, and $92 million, respectively. Acquired in-process research and development IPR&D represents an estimate of the fair value of the various R&D projects and technologies in the acquired company’s pipeline that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. In 2004 and 2002, we incurred charges of $554 million and $2,992 million, respectively, associated with writing off the fair value of IPR&D acquired in the Tularik and Immunex acquisitions, respectively (see Note 7, “Acquisitions” in the consolidated financial statements). Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal, and other administrative personnel; outside marketing expenses; overhead and occupancy costs; and other general and administrative costs. SG&A increased 31% for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to higher staff-related costs and higher outside marketing expenses, which reflects higher spending to support our products in competitive markets and sales growth. Outside marketing expenses include the Wyeth profit share related to ENBREL®, which has increased due to ENBREL® sales growth. In 2004, staff-related costs and outside marketing expenses increased approximately $255 million and $236 million, respectively. In 2005, we expect higher Wyeth profit share expense due to expected ENBREL® sales growth; however, we expect to see some leveraging of our 2004 SG&A spending during 2005. Additionally, SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter are expected to increase over the previous three quarters in a trend similar to that which has occurred in previous years. In 2003, SG&A expenses increased 35%, over the prior year primarily due to higher outside marketing expenses, which includes higher Wyeth profit share as a result of ENBREL® sales growth, and higher staff-related costs to support new products in competitive markets and sales growth. In 2003, outside marketing expenses, which include the Wyeth profit share, increased approximately $276 million and staff-related costs increased approximately $207 million. Other items, net In 2003, other items, net consisted of a benefit for the recovery of costs and expenses associated with a legal award related to an arbitration proceeding with Johnson & Johnson of $74 million, partially offset by a charitable contribution to the Amgen Foundation of $50 million. In 2002, other items, net consisted of a benefit of $40 million related to the recovery of certain expenses accrued in the fourth quarter of 2001 related to terminating collaboration agreements with various third parties and a legal award associated with the product license arbitration with Johnson & Johnson of $151 million, partially offset by a charitable contribution to the Amgen Foundation of $50 million. See Note 12, “Other items, net”, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 30.4%, 28.8%, and (103.3%) for 2004, 2003, and 2002 respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2004 has increased primarily due to the write-off of non-deductible IPR&D costs of $554 million in connection with the acquisition of Tularik. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. 34 Table of Contents Our negative effective tax rate for 2002 was due to the pre-tax loss resulting from the write-off of non-deductible IPR&D costs of $2,992 million in connection with the acquisition of Immunex. The 2003 effective tax rate was higher than the 2002 effective tax rate primarily due to Immunex IPR&D write-off in 2002 and the loss of the possession tax credit in 2003 partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. During 2002, we restructured our Puerto Rico manufacturing operations using a controlled foreign corporation. As permitted in Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes — Special Areas”, we do not provide U.S. income taxes on our controlled foreign corporations’ undistributed earnings that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. On October 22, 2004, the President of the United States signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Act”), which provides a temporary incentive to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings. However, uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the Jobs Act. As such, we are currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act and our 2004 results of operations do not reflect any impact relating to such repatriation provisions. See Note 3, “Income taxes”, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Stock option expense In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”. SFAS No. 123R will require us to account for our stock options using a fair-value-based method as described in such statement and recognize the resulting compensation expense in our financial statements. We currently account for our employee stock options using the intrinsic value method under APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related Interpretations, which generally results in no employee stock option expense. We plan to adopt SFAS No. 123R using the modified-retrospective transition method on July 1, 2005 and do not plan to restate our financial statements for periods ending prior to January 1, 2005. We expect that our after tax expense for stock options for the full twelve months in 2005 will range between $170 million to $220 million, or $0.13 to $0.17 per share. The estimated after tax expense for 2005 is less than the corresponding pro forma expense amount for 2004 ($292 million, see Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies — Employee stock options” in the consolidated financial statements) principally due to a reduction in the estimated number of stock options to be granted in 2005 and a reduction in the estimated fair value of our stock options, which is primarily due to a lower estimated future volatility of our stock price, reflecting the consideration of implied volatility in our publicly traded equity instruments. However, the actual annual expense in 2005 is dependent on a number of factors including the number of stock options granted, our common stock price and related expected volatility, and other inputs utilized in estimating the fair value of the stock options at the time of grant. Accordingly, the adoption in 2005 of SFAS No. 123R will have a material impact on our results of operations. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data (amounts in millions): December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 5,808 $ 5,123 Total assets 29,221 26,113 Current debt 1,173 — Non-current debt 3,937 3,080 Stockholders’ equity 19,705 19,389 We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations, and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, as well as to support our stock repurchase programs. However, in order to provide for greater financial flexibility and liquidity, we may raise additional capital from time to time. 35 Table of Contents Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities Of the total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2004, approximately $2.1 billion represents cash generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the United States (see “Results of Operations — Income taxes”). If these funds are repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, additional taxes on certain of these amounts would be required to be paid. Based on our preliminary analysis to date, we are limited under the Jobs Act to repatriate up to $500 million in foreign profits to take advantage of the 85% dividends received deduction. The primary objectives for our marketable securities portfolio, which is primarily comprised of fixed income investments, is liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return, consistent with these two objectives. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. Financing activities As of December 31, 2004, we had Convertible Notes (30-year, zero-coupon senior convertible notes) with an accreted value of $2.9 billion outstanding and having an aggregate face amount of $3.95 billion and yield to maturity of 1.125%. The original issue discount of $1.13 billion is being accreted to the balance of the Convertible Notes and recognized as interest expense over the life of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. The holders of the Convertible Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on various dates, the earliest of which is March 1, 2005, at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount (“accreted value”) through the purchase dates. In such event, under the terms of the Convertible Notes, we have the right to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock, which would be issued at the then current market price. On March 2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the Convertible Notes exercising their March 1, 2005 put option, we repurchased $1,175 million, or approximately 40%, of the outstanding Convertible Notes at their then-accreted value for cash. Concurrently, we amended the terms of the Convertible Notes to add an additional put date in order to permit the remaining holders, at their option, to cause us to repurchase the Convertible Notes on March 1, 2006 at the then-accreted value. Accordingly, the portion of the Convertible Notes outstanding at December 31, 2004 not repurchased on March 2, 2005 was classified as long-term debt (see Note 4, “Financing arrangements — Convertible notes” to the consolidated financial statements). Our Convertible Notes are rated A2 by Moody’s and A+ by Standard & Poor’s. Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert each of their notes into 8.8601 shares of common stock of Amgen (the “conversion rate”) at any time on or before the maturity date. The conversion price per share as of any day will equal the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount to that day, divided by the conversion rate, or $83.22 per share as of December 31, 2004. In November 2004, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due 2009 (the “2009 Notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.85% senior notes due 2014 (the “2014 Notes”). The net proceeds of $1,989 million are intended to be used for purchases of shares under our stock repurchase program and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital. In July 2004, we established a $1.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support. Additionally, we increased the size of our commercial paper authorization by $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility or commercial paper program as of December 31, 2004. We have a $1.0 billion shelf registration (the “$1 Billion Shelf”) which allows us to issue debt securities, common stock, and associated preferred share purchase rights, preferred stock, warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, securities purchase contracts, securities purchase units and depositary shares. The $1 Billion Shelf was established to provide for further financial flexibility and the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2004, no securities had been issued under the $1 Billion Shelf. As of December 31, 2004, we had $200 million of long-term debt securities outstanding. These long-term debt securities consisted of: 1) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.5% and 36 Table of Contents mature in 2007 (the “2007 Notes”) under a $500 million debt shelf registration (the ‘$500 Million Shelf”), and 2) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.1% and mature in 2097 (the “Century Notes”). Our outstanding long-term debt is rated A2 by Moody’s and A+ by Standard & Poor’s. Under the $500 Million Shelf, all of the remaining $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and as of December 31, 2004, we are in compliance with all applicable covenants. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 (amounts in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,697 $ 3,567 $ 2,249 Net cash used in investing activities (1,399 ) (3,210 ) (2,864 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (1,609 ) (1,372 ) 1,778 Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2004 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by the growth in product sales. This increase was partially offset primarily by the timing of cash payments relating to our tax liabilities (See consolidated statements of cash flows). Investing Capital expenditures totaled $1,336 million in 2004 compared with $1,357 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures in 2004 primarily related to the Thousand Oaks site expansion, the new ENBREL® manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, and the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion. Capital expenditures in 2003 primarily related to the new ENBREL® manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion, and the Seattle research center which was completed in January 2004. We currently estimate 2005 spending on capital projects and equipment to be consistent with 2004. The most significant of these expenditures are expected to relate to the new ENBREL® manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion, and the Thousand Oaks site expansion. Financing In December 2003, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized us to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of common stock. Additionally, in December 2004, the Board authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock. As of December 31, 2004, $5,969 million was available for stock repurchases. The amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased varies based on a variety of factors including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares. Repurchases under our stock repurchase programs reflect, in part, our confidence in the long-term value of Amgen common stock. A summary of our repurchase activity for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 is as follows (amounts in millions): 2004 2003 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars First quarter 10 $ 650 8 $ 451 Second quarter 17 1,000 7 449 Third quarter 24 1,398 5 324 Fourth quarter 18 1,024 10 577 Total 69 $ 4,072 30 $ 1,801 37 Table of Contents See “Part II — Item 5 Market for Registrants Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities — Item 5(c). Changes in Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information regarding our stock repurchase programs. In November 2004, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due 2009 (the “2009 Notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.85% senior notes due 2014 (the “2014 Notes”). The net proceeds of $1,989 million are intended to be used for purchases of shares under our stock repurchase program and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital. We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan. Employee stock option exercises and proceeds from the sale of stock by us pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans provided $453 million and $529 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Accordingly, the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties contingent upon certain future events. Such events could include, but are not limited to, development milestones, regulatory approvals and product sales. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following chart represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 6,584 $ 1,278 (2) $ 2,068 (2) $ 1,190 $ 2,048 Operating lease obligations 656 81 131 96 348 Purchase obligations(3) 2,291 1,087 525 298 381 Total contractual obligations $ 9,531 $ 2,446 $ 2,724 $ 1,584 $ 2,777 (1) The long-term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004 due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the Convertible Notes and the inclusion of future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on the 2007 Notes, the 2009 Notes, the 2014 Notes, and the Century Notes at fixed rates of 6.5%, 4.00%, 4.85%, and 8.1%, respectively, through maturity in 2007, 2009, 2014, and 2097, respectively. (2) Holders of the Convertible Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates as early as March 1, 2005 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount (“accreted value”) through the purchase dates. On March 2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the Convertible Notes exercising their March 1, 2005 put option, we repurchased $1,175 million, or approximately 40%, of the outstanding Convertible Notes at their then-accreted value for cash. Concurrently, we amended the terms of the Convertible Notes to add an additional put date in order to permit the remaining holders, at their option, to cause us to repurchase the Convertible Notes on March 1, 2006 at the then-accreted value. The amounts above reflect the Convertible Notes’ accreted value repurchased on March 1, 2005 and the remaining Convertible Notes’ accreted value on March 1, 2006, the next put date. In the event 38 Table of Contents we are required to repurchase the remaining Convertible Notes, we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock, which would be issued at the then current market price. See Note 4, “Financing arrangements” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the Convertible Notes. (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (1) our long-term supply agreement with BI Pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL®, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for ENBREL® and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved; (2) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (3) capital expenditures which primarily relate to the Thousand Oaks site expansion, the new Rhode Island manufacturing plant, and the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion; and (4) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales, sales incentives and returns Sales of our products other than EPOGEN® (see “EPOGEN® revenue recognition” below) are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. This typically occurs at the time products are shipped to the customer, generally a wholesale distributor. In the United States, we utilize these wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. Products we sell outside the United States are principally distributed to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third-party data, and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns. Accruals for estimated rebates (including Medicaid), wholesaler chargebacks, discounts, and other incentives (collectively “sales incentives”) are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales. Sales incentive accruals are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data, and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales incentives are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives are comprised of the following (amounts in millions): 2004 2003 Rebates $ 1,033 $ 520 Wholesaler chargebacks 1,069 553 Discounts and other incentives 490 286 Total sales incentives $ 2,592 $ 1,359 Rebates earned by healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals and pharmacies in the United States are the sales incentives that are most difficult to estimate. These rebates are performance-based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified sales volumes and growth. As a result, the calculation of 39 Table of Contents the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. These rebates totaled $1,033 million in 2004 and $520 million in 2003. We believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. For example, a 5 percent change in the revenue reduction attributable to rebates recognized in 2004 would have had an approximate $50 million effect on our reported product sales in 2004. Wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in “sales incentives” that relates to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the list prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers. These chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $1,069 million in 2004 and $553 million in 2003. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability. Amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. However, such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives (amounts in millions): Balance at Amounts Balance at Beginning Charged Against End of of Period Product Sales* Payments Period Year ended December 31, 2004 $ 358 $ 2,592 $ 2,361 $ 589 Year ended December 31, 2003 $ 212 $ 1,359 $ 1,213 $ 358 * Includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates. Such amounts represented less than 1% of amounts charged against product sales for both 2004 and 2003. Accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales. Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate. Historically, sales returns have been insignificant, amounting to approximately 1% of gross product sales. EPOGEN® revenue recognition We have the exclusive right to sell Epoetin alfa for dialysis, certain diagnostics, and all non-human, non-research uses in the United States. We granted to Johnson & Johnson a license relating to Epoetin alfa for sales in the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. Pursuant to this license, Amgen and Johnson & Johnson are required to compensate each other for Epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party’s exclusive market, sometimes referred to as “spillover”. Accordingly, we do not recognize product sales we make into the exclusive market of Johnson & Johnson and do recognize the product sales made by Johnson & Johnson into our exclusive market. Sales in our exclusive market are derived from our sales to our customers, as adjusted for spillover. We are employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party’s spillover based on independent third-party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage. Data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques, and accordingly, the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover. We initially recognize spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage, utilizing historical third-party data and subsequently adjust such amounts based on revised third-party data as received. Differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based on revised third-party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized EPOGEN® sales. However, such differences to date have not been material. 40 Table of Contents Deferred income taxes Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital, and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact our future effective tax rate. The Jobs Act provides a temporary incentive to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings. However, we are currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act, as there is uncertainty as to how to interpret many of its provisions. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, tax claims, and governmental investigations. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service and various state and foreign tax authorities. Significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions. While we believe our positions comply with applicable laws, we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters. While it is not possible to predict accurately or determine the eventual outcome of these matters, we do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our annual consolidated financial statements, although an adverse resolution in any quarterly reporting period of one or more of these items could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Tularik purchase price allocation The purchase price for Tularik was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. An independent third-party valuation firm was engaged to assist in determining the fair values of various research and development projects and technologies in Turlarik’s pipeline that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. This valuation required the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: • determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in-process projects, • projecting regulatory approvals, • estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects, • and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon reasonable assumptions given current available facts and circumstances. However, certain estimates for the purchase price allocation may change due to unanticipated events and as subsequent information becomes available. Factors That May Affect Amgen The following items are representative of the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements. 41 Table of Contents Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers such as state and federal governments, under programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and private insurance plans. In certain foreign markets, the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls. In the United States, there have been, there are, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of state and federal laws and/or regulations, or in some cases draft legislation or regulations that could limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of pharmaceutical and biologic products. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act (or the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA)) was enacted into law in December 2003. In addition, we believe that private insurers, such as managed care organizations, may adopt their own reimbursement reductions in response to legislation or regulations, including, without limitation, the MMA. However, we believe that private payers ability to fully implement reimbursement mechanisms in alignment with government legislation or regulations is limited. For example, we are aware of a few private payers who have adopted an average sales price methodology similar in structure to that of the MMA. However, the reimbursement rates based on such methodology are substantially greater than those under the current MMA reimbursement rates. We expect that, beginning in 2005, reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA are likely, to a degree, to negatively affect product sales of some of our marketed products. The main components of the MMA that affect our currently marketed products are as follows: • Through 2004 the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) mechanism was the basis of Medicare Part B payment for covered outpatient drugs and biologics. Effective January 1, 2005, in the physician clinic market segment, Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® will be reimbursed under a new Medicare Part B system that reimburses each product at 106% of its “average sales price” (“ASP”) (sometimes referred to as “ASP+6%”). On November 3, 2004, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) released final rules for revisions to payment policies under the physician fee schedule for 2005. CMS then calculated each of Amgen’s product’s ASPs based on data submissions from us. ASPs will remain in effect for one quarter and will be updated quarterly thereafter. The 2005 reimbursement rates for Aranesp®, Neulasta®, and NEUPOGEN®(calculated at 106% of the ASPs and initially based on third quarter 2004 company data), are lower than our 2004 reimbursement rates as the ASP methodology incorporates sales incentives offered to healthcare providers. Per the MMA, effective January 1, 2006, physicians in this market segment will have the choice under the “competitive acquisition program” (CAP) between purchasing and billing for drugs under the ASP+6% system or obtaining drugs from vendors selected by CMS via a competitive bidding process. • The Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS), which determines payment rates for specified covered outpatient drugs and biologics in the hospital outpatient setting, will continue to utilize AWP as the basis for reimbursement in 2005. On November 3, 2004, CMS issued a final rule for the reimbursement of Aranesp® in 2005. Under this final rule, as in 2003 and 2004, CMS continued the application of an “equitable adjustment” such that the Aranesp® reimbursement rate for 2005 is based on the AWP of PROCRIT®. For 2005 the reimbursement rate for Aranesp® is 83% of the AWP for PROCRIT®, down from 88% of the AWP for PROCRIT® in 2004, with a dose conversion ratio of 330 U PROCRIT® to 1 mcg Aranesp®, the same ratio as 2004. Effective January 1, 2006, the OPPS system will change from an AWP based reimbursement system to a system based on “average acquisition cost”. This change will affect Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® when administered in the hospital outpatient setting. Although we do not know how CMS will define the OPPS average acquisition cost, it is possible that CMS could link acquisition cost to ASP, which could lower the reimbursement rate. • Pursuant to final rules issued by CMS on November 3, 2004, Medicare reimbursement for EPOGEN® used in the dialysis setting for calendar year 2005 has been changed from the previous rate of $10 per 1,000 Units to $9.76 per 1,000 Units, a rate based upon an average acquisition cost for 2003 determined by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and adjusted for price inflation based on the Producer Price Index for pharmaceutical products. Pursuant to the CMS final rules, the difference between the 42 Table of Contents 2004 reimbursement rates for all drugs separately billed outside the dialysis composite rate (including EPOGEN®) and the 2005 reimbursement rates for such drugs will be added to the composite rate that dialysis providers receive for dialysis treatment. Again in 2006, the EPOGEN® rate may change, as the MMA provided for discretion in either continuing to pay for these separately reimbursed dialysis drugs at acquisition cost, or switching to an ASP based system. The payment rate for dialysis drugs not studied by the OIG, including Aranesp®, will be ASP+6%. We believe these changes driven by the MMA are lowering the 2005 reimbursement rate for all areas in which CMS provides reimbursement for EPOGEN®, Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. However, because we cannot predict the impact of any such changes on how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products, as of the date of this filing, we cannot predict the full impact of the MMA on our business; however, it is likely to be, to a degree, negative. In addition, on July 8, 2004, CMS released a proposed revision to the Hematocrit Measurement Audit Program Memorandum (HMA-PM), a Medicare payment review mechanism used by CMS to audit EPOGEN® utilization and appropriate hematocrit outcomes of dialysis patients. As of the date of this filing, the comment period for the proposed revision has expired and no final program memorandum has been issued. The proposed policy would not permit reimbursement for EPOGEN® in the following circumstances without medical justification: EPOGEN® doses greater than 40,000 Units per month in a patient with a hemoglobin greater than 13 grams per deciliter or doses greater than 20,000 Units per month in a patient with hemoglobin greater than 14 grams per deciliter. If the proposed revision, which has not yet been finalized, is adopted as the final form, it could result in a reduction in utilization of EPOGEN®. Although the proposed revision was scheduled to go into effect as early as January 1, 2005, it is unclear as to when it may be implemented. Amgen and the dialysis community have provided public comment based on data analysis suggesting that revision to the proposed policy is unwarranted. Given the importance of EPOGEN® utilization for maintaining the quality of care for dialysis patients, the precise impact of such a change on provider utilization remains unclear. If, and when, reimbursement rates or availability for our marketed products changes adversely or if we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement for our current or future products, health care providers may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them, which could reduce the use of our products or cause us to reduce the price of our products. This could result in lower product sales or revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. For example, in the United States the use of EPOGEN® in connection with treatment for end-stage renal disease is funded primarily by the U.S. federal government. In early 1997, CMS, formerly known as Healthcare Financing Administration (HCFA), instituted a reimbursement change for EPOGEN®, which materially and adversely affected our EPOGEN® sales until the policies were revised. Also, we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in the United States has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products, which may adversely impact product sales. Further, when a new therapeutic product is approved, the governmental and/or private coverage and reimbursement for that product is uncertain. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our approved products or product candidates, including those at a late stage of development, and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time. Sales of all our products are and will be affected by government and private payer reimbursement policies. Reduction in reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval. We and certain of our licensors and partners conduct research, preclinical testing, and clinical trials for our product candidates. In addition, we manufacture and contract manufacture and certain of our licensors and partners manufacture our product candidates. We also manufacture and contract manufacture, price, sell, distribute, and market or co-market our products for their approved indications. These activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, such as the FDA and CMS, as well as in foreign countries, including Europe. Currently, we are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from those countries’ regulatory authorities before we can manufacture (or have our third-party manufacturers produce product), market and sell our products in those countries. In our experience, obtaining regulatory approval is costly and takes many years, and after it is 43 Table of Contents obtained, it remains costly to maintain. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to terminate clinical trials, require additional testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval, require changes in labeling of our products, and mandate product withdrawals. Substantially all of our marketed products are currently approved in the United States and most are approved in Europe and in other foreign countries for specific uses. However, later discovery of unknown problems with our products could result in restrictions on the sale or use of such products, including potential withdrawal of the product from the market. If new medical data suggests an unacceptable safety risk or previously unidentified side-affects, we may voluntarily withdraw, or regulatory authorities may mandate the withdrawal of such product from the market for some period or permanently. We currently manufacture and market all our approved principal products, and we plan to manufacture and market many of our potential products. See “— We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.” Even though we have obtained regulatory approval for our marketed products, these products and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, ENBREL® is manufactured both by us at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility and by third-party contract manufacturers, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (“BI Pharma”) and Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”). Fill and finish of bulk product produced both at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility and at Genentech is done by us and third-party service providers. BI Pharma, Genentech, and these third-party service providers are also subject to FDA regulatory authority. (See “— Limits on supply for ENBREL® may constrain ENBREL® sales.”) In addition, later discovery of unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers could result in restrictions on the sale, manufacture, or use of such products, including potential withdrawal of the products from the market. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend, or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing or selling our marketed products until we or our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. In addition, if regulatory authorities determine that we or our licenser or partner conducting research and development activities on our behalf have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate, then they may not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. To date, there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed in such companies’ patents. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates, and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patents that they may claim prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly, and can preclude or delay commercialization of products. We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in patent litigation. For example, we are involved in an ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (“TKT”) and Aventis with respect to our erythropoietin patents. If we lose or settle this or other litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be: subject to competition and/or significant liabilities; required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology; or required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. We have filed applications for a number of patents and have been granted patents or obtained rights relating to erythropoietin, natural and recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, etanercept, and our other products and potential products. We market our erythropoietin, recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, 44 Table of Contents pegfilgrastim, and etanercept products as EPOGEN®, NEUPOGEN®, Aranesp®, Neulasta®, and ENBREL®, respectively. For additional information on our material patents see “Patents and Trademarks” in “Item 1. Business.” We also have been granted or obtained rights to patents in Europe relating to: erythropoietin; G-CSF; pegfilgrastim (pegylated G-CSF); etanercept; two relating to darbepoetin alfa; and hyperglycosylated erythropoietic proteins. Our European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December 12, 2004 and our European patent relating to G-CSF expires on August 22, 2006. We believe that after the expiration of each of these patents, other companies could receive approval for and market follow-on or biosimilar products to each of these products in Europe; presenting additional competition to our products. (See “Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.”) While we do not market erythropoietin in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson & Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp® in the EU, which competes with Johnson & Johnson’s and others’ erythropoietin products. We believe that the EU is currently in the process of developing regulatory requirements related to the development and approval of new competitive products. Until such requirements are finalized, we cannot predict when follow-on or biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU or to what extent such additional competition would impact future Aranesp® and NEUPOGEN®/ Neulasta® sales in the EU. However, based on the process and timing outlined by the EMEA, we believe product specific guidelines are not likely to be finalized until 2006. Limits on supply for ENBREL® may constrain ENBREL® sales. U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL® is impacted by many manufacturing variables, such as the timing and actual number of production runs, production success rate, bulk drug yield, and the timing and outcome of product quality testing. For example, in the second quarter of 2002, the prior co-marketer with respect to ENBREL®, experienced a brief period where no ENBREL® was available to fill patient prescriptions, primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from BI Pharma. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of ENBREL® to patients, we may lose patients, physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of ENBREL®, and ENBREL® sales will be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. See “— We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of ENBREL®; and our sources of supply are limited.” We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of ENBREL®; and our sources of supply are limited. We currently produce a substantial portion of annual ENBREL®supply at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility. However, we also depend on third parties for a significant portion of our ENBREL® supply as well as for the fill and finish of ENBREL® that we manufacture. BI Pharma is our primary third-party manufacturer of ENBREL® bulk drug; accordingly, our U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL® is currently significantly dependent on BI Pharma’s production schedule for ENBREL®. We would be unable to produce ENBREL® in sufficient quantities to substantially offset shortages in BI Pharma’s scheduled production if BI Pharma or other third-party manufacturers used for the fill and finish of ENBREL® bulk drug were to cease or interrupt production or services or otherwise fail to supply materials, products, or services to us for any reason, including due to labor shortages or disputes, due to regulatory requirements or action, or due to contamination of product lots or product recalls. This in turn could materially reduce our ability to satisfy demand for ENBREL®, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Factors that will affect our actual supply of ENBREL® at any time include, without limitation, the following: • BI Pharma does not produce ENBREL® continuously; rather, it produces the bulk drug substance through a series of periodic campaigns throughout the year. Our Rhode Island manufacturing facility is currently dedicated to ENBREL® production. The amount of commercial inventory available to us at any time depends on a variety of factors, including the timing and actual number of BI Pharma’s production runs, the actual number of runs at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility, and, for either the Rhode Island or BI Pharma facilities, the level of production yields and success rates, the timing and outcome of product quality testing, and the amount of filling and packaging capacity. 45 Table of Contents • BI Pharma schedules the vialing production runs for ENBREL® in advance, based on the expected timing and yield of bulk drug production runs. Therefore, if BI Pharma realizes production yields beyond expected levels, or provides additional manufacturing capacity for ENBREL®, it may not have sufficient vialing capacity for all of the ENBREL® bulk drug that it produces. As a result, even if we are able to increase our supply of ENBREL® bulk drug, BI Pharma may not be able to fill and finish the extra bulk drug in time to prevent any supply interruptions. We are dependent on third parties for some fill and finish and packaging of ENBREL® bulk drug substance manufactured at our Rhode Island facility. If third-party fill and finish and packaging manufacturers are unable to provide sufficient capacity or otherwise unable to provide services to us, then supply of ENBREL® could be adversely affected. Our current plan to increase U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL® includes completion of an additional large-scale cell culture commercial manufacturing facility adjacent to the current Rhode Island manufacturing facility. We expect to submit this facility for FDA approval in 2005. Additionally, we have entered into a manufacturing agreement with Genentech to produce ENBREL® at Genentech’s manufacturing facility in South San Francisco, California and the FDA approved this facility for ENBREL® production in October 2004. Under the terms of the agreement, Genentech is expected to produce ENBREL® through 2005, with an extension through 2006 by mutual agreement. ENBREL® bulk drug substance produced at the Genentech facility will be produced in campaigns similar to those conducted at BI Pharma. Consequently, supply from the Genentech facility is expected to also be dependent on the timing and number of production runs in addition to the other manufacturing, filling, and packaging risk discussed above. In addition, Wyeth is constructing a new manufacturing facility in Ireland, which is expected to increase the U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL®. If the additional ENBREL® manufacturing capacity at the Rhode Island site, or in Ireland are not completed on time, or if these manufacturing facilities do not receive FDA or the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (EMEA) approval before we encounter supply constraints, our ENBREL® sales would be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. (See “— Limits on supply for ENBREL® may constrain ENBREL® sales.”) If these third-party manufacturing facilities are completed and approved by the various regulatory authorities, our costs of acquiring bulk drug may fluctuate. We formulate, fill and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products. We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for EPOGEN®, Aranesp®, NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta® and some formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL® at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. Our global supply of these products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of this facility. Power failures, the breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, or failures to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of the FDA, among others, could adversely affect our formulation, fill and finish operations. As a result, we may be unable to supply these products, which could adversely and materially affect our product sales. Although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against business interruption loss, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. The extent of the coverage of our insurance could limit our ability to mitigate for lost sales and could result in such losses materially and adversely affecting our operating results. Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. For example, ENBREL® competes in certain circumstances with rheumatoid arthritis products marketed by Biogen IDEC Inc., Centocor, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Abbott, Genentech, Pfizer, Novartis, and Sanofi-Aventis, as well as the generic drug methotrexate, and may face competition from other potential therapies being developed. Additionally, Aranesp® competes with Johnson & Johnson in the United States and the EU. Further, if our currently marketed products are 46 Table of Contents approved for new uses, or if we sell new products, we may face new, additional competition that we do not face today. Additionally, some of our competitors, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, market products or are actively engaged in research and development in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs approved for other indications that may be approved for the same indications as those of our products, and off-label use of drugs approved for other indications. Our European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December 12, 2004 and our European patent relating to G-CSF expires on August 22, 2006. We believe that after the expiration of each of these patents, other companies could receive approval for and market follow-on or biosimilar products to each of these products in Europe; presenting additional competition to our products. While we do not market erythropoietin in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson & Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp® in the EU, which competes with Johnson & Johnson’s and others’ erythropoietin products. We believe that the EU is currently in the process of developing regulatory requirements related to the development and approval of follow-on or biosimilar products. Until such requirements are finalized, we cannot predict when follow-on or biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU or to what extent such additional competition would impact future Aranesp® and NEUPOGEN®/ Neulasta® sales in the EU. However, based on the process and timing outlined by the EMEA, we believe product specific guidelines are not likely to be finalized until 2006. Our products may compete against products that have lower prices, superior performance, are easier to administer, or that are otherwise competitive with our products. Our inability to compete effectively could adversely affect product sales. Large pharmaceutical corporations may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial experience and human resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop, and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. Business combinations among our competitors may also increase competition and the resources available to our competitors. Certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components are single-sourced from third parties; third-party supply failures could adversely affect our ability to supply our products. Certain raw materials necessary for commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Also, certain medical devices and components necessary for fill, finish, and packaging of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Certain of these raw materials, medical devices, and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third-party suppliers and, in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the FDA so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the FDA approved that other supplier. We would be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices, or components for an indeterminate period of time if these third-party single-source suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials or products to us for any reason, including due to regulatory requirements or action, due to adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier, or due to labor shortages or disputes. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and the formulation of our products are derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin, or HSA. We are investigating alternatives to certain biological sources. Raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. Also, some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. A material shortage, contamination, recall, and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This too, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. 47 Table of Contents Our product development efforts may not result in commercial products. We intend to continue an aggressive research and development program. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few research and development projects produce a commercial product. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development, such as in early human clinical trials, may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: • the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results • the product candidate was not effective in treating a specified condition or illness • the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals • the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use • the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize • other companies or people have or may have proprietary rights to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all • the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics • certain of our licensors or partners may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities Several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process, including, but not limited to, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“BDNF”), Megakaryocyte Growth and Development Factor (“MGDF”), and Glial Cell Lined-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“GDNF”). For example, in 1997, we announced the failure of BDNF for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease, because the product candidate, when administered by injection, did not produce acceptable clinical results for a specific use after a phase 3 trial, even though BDNF had progressed successfully through preclinical and earlier clinical trials. In addition, in 1998, we discontinued development of MGDF, a novel platelet growth factor, at the phase 3 trial stage after several people in platelet donation trials developed low platelet counts and neutralizing antibodies. Also, in June 2004, we announced that the phase 2 study of GDNF for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease did not meet the primary study endpoint upon completion of six months of the double-blind treatment phase of the study even though a small phase 1 pilot investigator initiated open label study over a three year period appeared to result in improvements for advanced Parkinson’s disease patients. Subsequently, in the fall of 2004 we discontinued clinical development of GDNF in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease after several patients in the phase 2 study developed neutralizing antibodies and new preclinical data showed that GDNF caused irreversible damage to the area of the brain critical to movement control and coordination. On February 11, 2005, we confirmed our previous decision to halt clinical trials and, as a part of that decision and based on thorough scientific review, we also concluded that we will not provide GDNF to the 48 patients who participated in clinical trials that were terminated in the fall of 2004. Of course, there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product. We cannot guarantee we will be able to produce commercially successful products. Further, clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists, medical personnel, regulatory personnel, statisticians, and others, which may delay, limit, or prevent further clinical development or regulatory approvals of a product candidate. Also, the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied by product and by the intended use of a product. We expect that this will likely be the case with future product candidates and we cannot predict the length of time to complete necessary clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval.”) 48 Table of Contents We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market. If we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products, and changes to or re-approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required, any of which could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. After any of our products are approved for commercial use, we or regulatory bodies could decide that changes to our product labeling are required. Label changes may be necessary for a number of reasons, including: the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns by regulatory agencies or the discovery of significant problems with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products. Any significant concerns raised about the safety or efficacy of our products could also result in the need to reformulate those products, to conduct additional clinical trials, to make changes to our manufacturing processes, or to seek re-approval of our manufacturing facilities. Significant concerns about the safety and effectiveness of a product could ultimately lead to the revocation of its marketing approval. The revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could be required even if there is no clearly established connection between the product and the safety or efficacy concerns that have been raised. The revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval.”) Our business may be impacted by government investigations or litigation. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to various patent matters, government investigations, and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Matters required to be disclosed by us are set forth in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and are updated as required in subsequently filed Form 10-Qs. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts can occur. Consequently, it is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such amounts are incurred. The Federal government, state governments and private payers are investigating, and many have filed actions against, numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Amgen and Immunex, alleging that the reporting of prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in false and overstated Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”), which in turn is alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by Medicare beneficiaries, insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans and other payers to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products. As of the date of this filing, a number of these actions have been brought against us and/or Immunex, now a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. Additionally, a number of states have pending investigations regarding our Medicaid drug pricing practices and the U.S. Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services have requested that Immunex produce documents relating to pricing issues. Further, certain state government entity plaintiffs in some of these AWP cases are also alleging that companies, including ours, are not reporting their “best price” to the states under the Medicaid program. These cases and investigations are described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Average Wholesale Price Litigation” in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, and are updated as required in subsequent Form 10-Qs. Other states and agencies could initiate investigations of our pricing practices. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions and/or investigations could result in substantial economic damages and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such amounts are incurred. We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims. Product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert manage- 49 Table of Contents ment’s attention, and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain company products. Our operating results may fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause financial results to be below expectations. Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. In budgeting our operating expenses for the foreseeable future, we assume that revenues will continue to grow; however, some of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term. Because of this, even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period’s results to be below our expectations or projections. A revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors, some of which we cannot control. For example, we may face: • changes in the government’s or private payers’ reimbursement policies for our products • inability to maintain regulatory approval of marketed products • changes in our product pricing strategies • lower than expected demand for our products • inability to provide adequate supply of our products • changes in wholesaler buying patterns • increased competition from new or existing products • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates Of course, there may be other factors that affect our revenues in any given period. Similarly if investors or the investment community are uncertain about our financial performance for a given period, our stock price could also be adversely impacted. We have grown rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted. We have had an aggressive growth plan that has included substantial and increasing investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and facilities. We plan to continue to grow and our plan has a number of risks, some of which we cannot control. For example: • we need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses, and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control • we will need to assimilate new staff members • we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger and faster growing organization • we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity, and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control • we will need to start up and operate a number of new manufacturing facilities, which may result in temporary inefficiencies and higher cost of goods Of course, there may be other risks and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these or other risks. Our stock price is volatile, which could adversely affect your investment. Our stock price, like that of other biotechnology companies, is highly volatile. For example, in the fifty-two weeks prior to December 31, 2004, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $66.88 per share to a low of $52.00 per share. Our stock price may be affected by a number of factors, such as: • changes in reimbursement policies or medical practices • adverse developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products 50 Table of Contents • clinical trial results • actual or anticipated product supply constraints • product development announcements by us or our competitors • regulatory matters • announcements in the scientific and research community • intellectual property and legal matters • broader economic, industry and market trends unrelated to our performance In addition, if our revenues, earnings or other financial results in any period fail to meet the investment community’s expectations, there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price. Our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations. The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing, and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation. (See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval.” and “— We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.”) While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on current best practices, we cannot assure you that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations and/or laws. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations and/or laws a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, including withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, or other sanctions or litigation. Our marketing of ENBREL® will be dependent in part upon Wyeth. Under a co-promotion agreement, we and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL® in the United States and Canada. A management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from us and Wyeth is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL®: including strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing, and the establishment of a brand team. The brand team, with equal representation from us and Wyeth, will prepare and implement the annual marketing plan, which includes a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is responsible for all sales activities. If Wyeth fails to market ENBREL® effectively or if we and Wyeth fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, our sales of ENBREL® may be adversely affected. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the health care and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration, and use of related therapies. Organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and health care providers could result in decreased use of our products. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use of our products could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. 51 Table of Contents Continual manufacturing process improvement efforts may result in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired. In connection with our ongoing process improvement activities associated with products we manufacture, we continually invest in our various manufacturing practices and related processes with the objective of increasing production yields and success rates to gain increased cost efficiencies and capacity utilization. Depending on the timing and outcomes of these efforts and our other estimates and assumptions regarding future product sales, the carrying value of certain manufacturing facilities or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value at the time that such effects are identified. The potential recognition of impairment in the carrying value, if any, could have a material and adverse affect on our results of operations. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our merger with Tularik. On August 13, 2004, we merged with Tularik Inc. The success of our merger with Tularik will depend, in part, on our ability to retain Tularik staff and to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings, and growth opportunities from integrating the businesses of Tularik with the businesses of Amgen. Our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful integration of the operations and personnel of Tularik. The integration of two independent companies is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others: • retaining key staff members • consolidating research and development operations • consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures • preserving ours and Tularik’s research and development, and other important relationships • minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns • coordinating geographically separate organizations In addition, even if we are able to integrate Tularik’s operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the synergies, cost savings, or sales and growth opportunities that we expect or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame. For example, as of the date of this filing, we have discontinued a number of Tularik clinical development programs and may discontinue other or all such programs. Further, the elimination of significant duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated and the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies. We cannot assure you that the integration of Tularik with us will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us to result from the merger. Our failure to achieve these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest income earned on our fixed income investment portfolio is impacted by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates upon reinvestment of funds received on maturity or sale of securities at the then current market rates. In 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements, which also qualify and are designated as fair value hedges, to protect against possible increases in value of the 2009 Notes and 2014 Notes. In 2003, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements, which also qualify and are designated as fair value hedges, to protect against possible increase in value of the 2007 Notes and the Century Notes. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our 2007 Notes, 2009 Notes, 2014 Notes, Century Notes and Convertible Notes because they bear interest at fixed rates. The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our investment portfolio and debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed our available-for-sale debt securities, comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities, are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes. For the interest rate swaps, the tables present the notional amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity date. Variable rates relating to the interest 52 Table of Contents rate swaps are the average forward rates for the term of each contract. The notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract.

On March 2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the Convertible Notes exercising their March 1, 2005 put option, we repurchased $1,175 million, or approximately 40%, of the outstanding Convertible Notes at their then-accreted value for cash. Concurrently, we amended the terms of the Convertible Notes to add an additional put date in order to permit the remaining holders, at their option, to cause us to repurchase the Convertible Notes on March 1, 2006 at the then-accreted 53 Table of Contents value. The amounts above reflect the Convertible Notes’ accreted value repurchased on March 1, 2005 and the remaining Convertible Notes’ accreted value on March 1, 2006, the next put date. In the event we are required to repurchase the remaining Convertible Notes, we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock, which would be issued at the then current market price. See Note 4, “Financing arrangements” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the Convertible Notes. We are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had equity forward contracts to hedge against changes in the fair market value of a portion of our equity investment portfolio. We did not have material equity price risk on the unhedged portion of our equity investment portfolio at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately the Euro, as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to hedge against the effects of such fluctuations. Both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates have been mitigated by the natural, opposite impact to our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our results of operations. As such, the impact to our results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated.",2023-12-30 18:05:16.247918

Item 2. PROPERTIES Amgen’s principal executive offices and a majority of its administrative, manufacturing, and R&D facilities are located in forty-two buildings in Thousand Oaks, California. Thirty-six of the buildings are owned and seven are leased. Adjacent to these buildings are facilities that are under construction and additional property for future expansion. The Thousand Oaks, California properties include manufacturing facilities licensed by various regulatory bodies to produce commercial quantities of Epoetin alfa, Aranesp®, Neulasta®, and NEUPOGEN®. The Company owns six buildings in Longmont, Colorado, including a manufacturing complex that is licensed to produce commercial quantities of Epoetin alfa and Aranesp® bulk drug substance. The Company has undeveloped land adjacent to the Longmont site to accommodate future expansion. Amgen also owns two buildings and leases four buildings in Boulder, Colorado, housing process development research and manufacturing facilities capable of producing commercial quantities of Kineret® bulk drug substance. 19 Amgen owns ten buildings and leases fifteen buildings in the Seattle, Washington area, which house research, manufacturing, and administrative facilities. In January 2004, the Company opened the Seattle research center. In connection with the acquisition, the Company initiated an integration plan to consolidate certain Immunex leased facilities (see Note 3, “Immunex acquisition” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company also owns additional property for future expansion in the Seattle, Washington area. Amgen owns five buildings in West Greenwich, Rhode Island, including a manufacturing facility which produces commercial quantities of ENBREL®. The Company is also currently constructing a new manufacturing plant to be built adjacent to the existing manufacturing facility in Rhode Island to produce commercial quantities of ENBREL® with completion expected in 2005. Elsewhere in North America, the Company owns a distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky, and a research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Company leases facilities for administrative offices in Washington, D.C. and Canada, and leases four facilities for regional sales and marketing offices in the United States. Outside the continental United States, Amgen owns four buildings in Juncos, Puerto Rico, including a fill and finish manufacturing facility and a warehouse. The Company is constructing new manufacturing and testing facilities with completion dates for various structures expected in 2004 and beyond. The Company also owns additional property on the Puerto Rico Site for future expansion. The Company also owns a European packaging and distribution center in Breda, The Netherlands. The Company leases facilities in fifteen European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, for administration, sales and marketing, and/or development. Amgen believes that its existing facilities plus anticipated additions are sufficient to meet its expected needs. Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Certain of the Company’s legal proceedings are discussed below. While it is impossible to predict accurately or to determine the eventual outcome of these matters, the Company does not believe any such proceedings currently pending will have a material adverse effect on its annual consolidated financial statements, although an adverse resolution in any reporting period of one or more of the proceedings could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Transkaryotic Therapies and Aventis Litigation On April 15, 1997, Amgen filed suit in the Massachusetts District Court against Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (“TKT”) and Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc. (“HMR” — now Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc., together with TKT, the “Defendants”) alleging infringement of three U.S. patents owned by Amgen that claim an erythropoietin product and processes for making erythropoietin. Amgen sought an injunction preventing the Defendants from making, importing, using, or selling erythropoietin in the United States. On October 7, 1999, Amgen filed an amended complaint, which added two additional patents to the litigation. Defendants’ amended answer asserted that all five of the patents-in-suit were not infringed, were invalid, or were unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Amgen’s motion for summary judgment of literal infringement was granted by the Massachusetts District Court on April 26, 2000 with respect to claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 5,955,422 (the “’422 Patent”). On May 15, 2000, trial began in the Massachusetts District Court. On June 9, 2000, the Massachusetts District Court granted Defendants’ motion for non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,618,698 (the “’698 Patent”), removing the ’698 Patent from this action. On July 21, 2000, the Massachusetts District Court granted Amgen’s motion for judgment on the Defendants’ defenses of invalidity based upon anticipation and obviousness. On January 19, 2001, the Massachusetts District Court ruled that claims 2-4 of the ’080 Patent, claims 1, 3, 4, and 6 of the ’349 Patent and claim 1 of the ’422 Patent were valid, enforceable, and infringed by TKT’s 20 EPO product and the cells used to make such product. The Massachusetts District Court also held that claim 7 of the ’349 patent and claims 1, 2, and 9 of the ’933 Patent were not infringed, and that if infringed the claims of the ’933 patent would be invalid. On January 26, 2001, TKT and HMR filed a Notice of Appeal and on February 14, 2001, Amgen filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On March 22, 2001, Amgen filed an Amended Notice of Cross-Appeal to include claim 9 of the ’698 patent. After the parties briefed the issues on appeal, oral arguments were heard on May 7, 2002 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On January 6, 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the District Court’s decision that TKT and HMR infringe the ’349 and ’422 patents. The court further upheld the enforceability and validity of all of the asserted claims except for validity over two references which was vacated and remanded to the District Court. The court vacated and remanded to the District Court of Massachusetts for further consideration of (i) the finding of infringement of the ’080 patent, (ii) the holding of non-infringement of the ’698 patent, and (iii) the effect of two references on the validity of the asserted claims of the patents. On January 20, 2003, TKT and HMR filed a Combined Motion for Panel Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc with the Federal Circuit regarding the court’s affirmance of the validity of the asserted claims under 35 U.S.C. § 112. On March 3, 2003, the Federal Circuit denied TKT and HMR’s Motions for Panel Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc. The Massachusetts District Court held a trial on the remanded issues on October 7-8 and 15-17 and November 3-6, 2003. On October 30, 2003, the Massachusetts District Court ruled that claims 2-4 of the ’080 patent are infringed. The rest of the remanded issues are awaiting decision from the Massachusetts District Court. Israel Bio-Engineering Project Litigation On September 3, 2002, Israel Bio-Engineering Project (“IBEP”), filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Company, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Immunex Corporation, Wyeth and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, relating to a U.S. Patent No. 5,981,701. Although not the title owner of record, IBEP alleges that it owns the patent. IBEP asserts that the manufacture and sale of ENBREL® (etanercept) infringes claim 1 of this patent. IBEP seeks an accounting of damages and of any royalties or license fees paid to a third-party and seeks to have the damages trebled on account of alleged willful infringement. IBEP also seeks to force the defendants to take a compulsory non-exclusive license. On September 4, 2003, Yeda Research and Development Co. Ltd. (“Yeda”), the title owner of record of the ’701 patent, joined as an interventor-defendant. On February 18, 2004, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Yeda on the issue of ownership. As a result of the granting of summary judgment, the Company and Immunex Corporation expect the court to enter judgment in their favor. Columbia Litigation On June 18, 2003, Amgen and Immunex filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against The Trustees of Columbia University seeking a declaratory judgment. In its complaint, Amgen and Immunex request a declaratory judgment that Columbia’s claims for royalties under license agreements with Amgen and Immunex lack merit and that no royalties are owed. The complaint further seeks a declaratory judgment that Amgen and Immunex do not infringe Columbia’s recently issued U.S. Patent No. 6,455,275 and that the ’275 patent is invalid and unenforceable. On February 12, 2004, Columbia filed breach of contract and declaratory relief counterclaims against Amgen and Immunex along with its answer to the complaint. Average Wholesale Price Litigation Amgen and Immunex are named as defendants, either separately or together, in thirteen (13) civil actions broadly alleging that they, together with many other pharmaceutical manufacturers, reported prices for certain products in a manner that allegedly inflated reimbursement under Medicare and/or Medicaid, 21 including co-payments paid to providers who prescribe and administer the products. All but one of these actions (the Swanston matter, discussed below) have been consolidated, or are in the process of being consolidated, in a federal Multi-District Litigation proceeding (“the MDL Proceeding”), captioned In Re: Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation MDL No. 1456 and pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (“the Massachusetts District Court”). The complaints assert varying claims under the federal RICO statutes, their state law corollaries, as well as state law claims for deceptive trade practices, common law fraud, and various related state law claims. The complaints seek an undetermined amount of damages, as well as other relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief. These cases include the following: Citizens for Consumer Justice, et al., v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., et al. (originally filed in the Massachusetts District Court and consolidated into the MDL Proceeding as the lead MDL case); Teamsters Health & Welfare Fund of Philadelphia, et al., v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., et al.; Action Alliance of Senior Citizens of Greater Philadelphia v. Immunex Corp.; Constance Thompson, et al. v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., et al.; Ronald Turner, et al. v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., et al.; Congress of California Seniors v. Abbott Laboratories, et al. These cases also include State of Nevada v. American Home Products Corporation, et al., State of Montana ex rel. Mike McGrath, Attorney General v. Abbott Laboratories, et al,. County of Suffolk, New York v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., et al. with respect to which the Massachusetts District Court conducted a hearing on the defendants’ Motions to Dismiss. No ruling has been issued and the respective parties are awaiting the Massachusetts District Court’s decision on the defendants’ Motions to Dismiss. Further, the cases also include County of Westchester, New York v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., et al., County of Rockland, New York v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., et al. with respect to which the parties have agreed to stay these cases pending the Massachusetts District Court’s ruling on the defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Suffolk County’s Amended Complaint. Robert J. Swanston v. TAP Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., et al. (removed from Arizona Superior Court, Maricopa County to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona and consolidated into the MDL Proceeding in the Massachusetts District Court). Amgen was served with plaintiff’s second amended class action complaint on January 8, 2003. Immunex was served with plaintiff’s second amended complaint on January 7, 2003, and was served with a proper summons on February 27, 2003. On October 9, 2003 the Massachusetts District Court conducted a hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion to Remand the case to Arizona Superior Court. On January 9, 2004, the Massachusetts District Court issued a decision allowing the Plaintiff’s Motion to Remand, and ordering the case remanded to Arizona Superior Court, Maricopa County. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local No. 68 Welfare Fund v. AstraZeneca PLC, et al. (removed from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Equity Division Monmouth County, to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and in the process of being consolidated into the MDL Proceeding in the Massachusetts District Court). Amgen was served with this complaint on July 14, 2003 and Immunex was served with this complaint on July 15, 2003. This complaint asserts varying claims related to deceptive trade practices and common law fraud. The complaint seeks an undetermined amount of damages, as well as other relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief. Immunex Governmental Investigations According to press reports, many pharmaceutical companies are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and/or state agencies related to the pricing of their products. Immunex has received notices from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting it to produce documents in connection with a Civil False Claims Act investigation of the pricing of Immunex’s current and former products for sale and eventual reimbursement by Medicare or state Medicaid programs. Immunex also received similar requests to procure documents from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state agencies. Several of Immunex’s current and former products are or were regularly sold at substantial discounts from list price. The Company does not know what action, if any, the federal government or any state agency may take as a result of their investigations. 22 State Attorney General Investigations Amgen and/or Immunex have been advised by the Attorneys General for the state of California, Florida, Kentucky, Nevada, and Illinois (also acting on behalf of 8 other Attorneys General) of pending investigations regarding drug pricing practices pertaining to the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (“AMP”) and Best Price calculations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Act. These states have requested that Amgen and Immunex preserve records relating to AMP and best price calculations. The Company does not know what actions, if any, may be taken as a result of these investigations. Johnson & Johnson Arbitration/ Demand for Separate BLA On November 11, 2003, Ortho Biotech Products, L.P., Ortho Biotech Inc., and Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical (wholly owned subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson, collectively, “Ortho”) filed a demand for arbitration against the Company before the American Arbitration Association in Chicago, Illinois. In its demand, Ortho seeks declaratory relief that, among other things, (1) Ortho has the right under the parties’ Product License Agreement to apply for its own FDA license to market its brand of recombinant erythropoietin, Procrit®, based on bulk product supplied by the Company, (2) the Company must cooperate with Ortho to achieve Ortho’s separate FDA licensure, (3) the Company must negotiate with Ortho to reach agreement to permit Ortho to receive bulk erythropoeitin from the Company, so that Ortho can market finished Procrit® under its own FDA license, (4) pending FDA approval of Ortho’s separate license, the Company must continue to supply Ortho with Ortho’s commercial requirements of finished erythropoeitin products, and (5) the Company must cooperate with Ortho on erythropoeitin development projects, including Ortho’s proposal for a 120,000 unit per ml formulation. Amgen contests Ortho’s claims and will respond accordingly. Item 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company’s security holders during the last quarter of its fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. PART II Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS The Company’s common stock trades on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol AMGN. As of February 13, 2004, there were approximately 16,000 holders of record of the Company’s common stock. No cash dividends have been paid on the common stock to date, and the Company currently intends to utilize any earnings for development of the Company’s business and for repurchases of its common stock. The following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the range of high and low closing sales prices of the common stock as quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market for the years 2003 and 2002: High Low 2003 4th Quarter $ 67.50 $ 56.76 3rd Quarter 72.37 63.61 2nd Quarter 67.54 56.90 1st Quarter 59.06 48.09 2002 4th Quarter $ 51.75 $ 43.66 3rd Quarter 48.54 31.07 2nd Quarter 61.39 37.80 1st Quarter 62.48 54.33 23 Item 6.

(2) As part of the accounting for the Immunex acquisition, the Company recorded a charge to write-off acquired IPR&D of $2,991.8 million in 2002. The IPR&D charge represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in-process technology for projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. See Note 3, “Immunex acquisition” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the IPR&D write-off. (3) See Note 4, “Other items, net” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of other items, net for 2003, 2002, and 2001. Other items, net in 2000 includes a benefit of $73.9 million related to a legal proceeding with Johnson & Johnson partially offset by a charitable contribution of $25 million to the Amgen Foundation. Other items, net in 1999 relates to various legal proceedings. (4) On July 15, 2002, Amgen acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Immunex for approximately $17.8 billion. See Note 3, “Immunex acquisition” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the acquisition and the related accounting. (5) In March 2002, Amgen issued 30-year zero-coupon, senior convertible notes with a face amount at maturity of $3.95 billion. See Note 8, “Financing arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the Convertible Notes. 24 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Acquisition of Immunex Corporation On July 15, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Immunex Corporation (“Immunex”) for stock and cash valued at $17.8 billion in a transaction accounted for as a business combination (see Note 3, “Immunex acquisition” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Immunex was a leading biotechnology company dedicated to developing immune system science to protect human health. The acquisition has enhanced Amgen’s strategic position within the biotechnology industry by strengthening and diversifying its (1) product base and product pipeline in key therapeutic areas, and (2) discovery research capabilities in proteins and antibodies. The acquisition was structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Unless otherwise indicated, the discussions in this report of the results of operations of the Company reflect the inclusion of the results of operations of Immunex commencing July 16, 2002. The results of operations of the Company prior to July 16, 2002 include only the historical results of Amgen. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes that existing funds, cash generated from operations, and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy its working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, as well as to support its stock repurchase program. However, in order to provide for greater financial flexibility and liquidity, the Company may raise additional capital from time to time. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities The Company had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $5,122.9 million and $4,663.9 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Of the total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2003, approximately $1.6 billion represents cash generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the United States (see “Results of Operations — Income taxes”). If these funds are repatriated for use in the Company’s U.S. operations, additional taxes on certain of these amounts would be required to be paid. The Company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to the United States. The primary objectives for the Company’s marketable securities portfolio, which is primarily comprised of fixed income investments, are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return to the Company, consistent with these two objectives. The Company’s investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. Cash flows Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be the Company’s primary recurring source of funds. In 2003, operations provided $3,566.6 million of cash compared with $2,248.8 million in 2002. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2003 resulted primarily from higher earnings (See Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). Capital expenditures totaled $1,356.8 million in 2003 compared with $658.5 million in 2002. The increase in capital expenditures in 2003 resulted primarily from capital expenditures related to the Rhode Island manufacturing plant, the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion, and the Seattle research center. The Company receives cash from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock by Amgen pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan. Employee stock option exercises and proceeds from the sale of stock by Amgen pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans provided $529.0 million and $427.8 million of cash in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 25 will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of the Company’s stock relative to the exercise price of such options. The Company has a stock repurchase program primarily to reduce the dilutive effect of its employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Additionally, stock repurchases beyond this level reflect the Company’s confidence in the long-term value of Amgen common stock. In 2003, the Company repurchased 29.7 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1,801.0 million. In 2002, the Company repurchased 28.0 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1,420.4 million. Stock repurchased in 2002 included 11.3 million shares of common stock repurchased simultaneously with the issuance of the 30-year, zero-coupon senior convertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”, discussed below) at a total cost of $650 million. In December 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock allowing for a multi-year stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2003, approximately $5 billion was available for stock repurchases. The amount the Company spends and the number of shares repurchased varies based on a variety of factors, including employee stock option grants, the stock price and blackout periods in which the Company is restricted from repurchasing shares. Financing As of December 31, 2003, the Company had $2.88 billion of Convertible Notes outstanding, which have an aggregate face amount of $3.95 billion at maturity with a yield to maturity of 1.125%. The original issue discount of $1.13 billion is being accreted to the balance of the Convertible Notes and recognized as interest expense over the life of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. The holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their notes on March 1, 2005, March 1, 2007, March 1, 2012, and March 1, 2017 at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount to the purchase dates. In such event, the Company may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock, which would be issued at the then current market price (see Note 8, “Financing arrangements — Convertible notes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company’s Convertible Notes are rated A2 by Moody’s and A+ by Standard & Poor’s. In October 2003, the Company established a $1.0 billion shelf registration (the “$1 Billion Shelf”) which allows the Company to issue debt securities, common stock, and associated preferred share purchase rights, preferred stock, warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, securities purchase contracts, securities purchase units and depositary shares of the Company. The $1 Billion Shelf was established to provide for further financial flexibility and the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2003, no securities had been issued under the $1 Billion Shelf. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had $200 million of unsecured long-term debt securities outstanding. These unsecured long-term debt securities consisted of: 1) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.5% and mature in 2007 (the “Notes”) under a $500 million debt shelf registration (the “$500 Million Shelf”), and 2) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.1% and mature in 2097 (the “Century Notes”). The Company’s outstanding unsecured long-term debt is rated A2 by Moody’s and A+ by Standard & Poor’s. Under the $500 Million Shelf, all of the remaining $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under the Company’s medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. The Company has a commercial paper program which provides for unsecured short-term borrowings up to an aggregate face amount of $200 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company repaid all of the outstanding balances under the commercial paper program, totaling $100 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to its financial position or results of operations. 26 Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which the Company cannot reasonably predict future payment. The following chart represents the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 3,903.9 $ 14.6 $ 2,949.4 (2) $ 122.2 $ 817.7 Operating lease obligations 181.8 50.9 65.1 35.1 30.7 Purchase obligations(3) 3,227.0 1,694.6 800.5 260.8 471.1 Total contractual obligations $ 7,312.7 $ 1,760.1 $ 3,815.0 $ 418.1 $ 1,319.5 (1) The long-term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003 due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the Convertible Notes and the inclusion of future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on the Notes and the Century Notes at fixed rates of 6.5% and 8.1%, respectively, through maturity in 2007 and 2097, respectively. (2) Holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates as early as March 1, 2005 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount (“accreted value”) through the purchase date. The amount above represents the accreted value on March 1, 2005. The accreted value based on the 30-year contractual maturity is $3.95 billion. In the event the Company is required to repurchase the notes, it may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock which would be issued at the then current market price. (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (1) the Company’s long-term supply agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (“BI Pharma”) for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL®, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for ENBREL® and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved; (2) research and development commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (3) capital expenditures which primarily relate to the new Rhode Island manufacturing plant and the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion; and (4) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. 27 Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, sales by product and geographic region were as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 EPOGEN® — U.S. $ 2,434.7 $ 2,260.6 $ 2,108.5 Aranesp® — U.S. 979.9 284.7 27.0 Aranesp® — International 563.9 130.9 14.5 Neulasta® — U.S. 1,175.7 463.5 — Neulasta® — International 79.3 — — NEUPOGEN® — U.S. 880.5 1,041.7 1,050.6 NEUPOGEN® — International 386.2 337.9 295.8 ENBREL® — U.S. 1,253.7 346.2 — ENBREL® — International 46.3 15.9 — Other product sales — U.S. 39.4 100.0 13.3 Other product sales — International 28.6 9.8 1.3 Total product sales $ 7,868.2 $ 4,991.2 $ 3,511.0 Total U.S. $ 6,763.9 $ 4,496.7 $ 3,199.4 Total International 1,104.3 494.5 311.6 Total product sales $ 7,868.2 $ 4,991.2 $ 3,511.0 See “Products” in Item 1. Business for a discussion of these products and their approved indications. Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, wholesaler inventory management practices, foreign exchange effects, new product launches and indications, competitive products, product supply, and acquisitions. In 2003, worldwide product sales were $7,868.2 million, an increase of $2,877.0 million or 58% over the prior year. Sales growth for 2003 was principally driven by demand for Aranesp®, ENBREL®, and Neulasta®. Year over year comparisons were aided by the mid-year 2002 oncology launch of Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa), the mid-year 2002 acquisition of ENBREL® (etanercept), and the second quarter 2002 U.S. launch of Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim). U.S. product sales for 2003 were $6,763.9 million, an increase of $2,267.2 million, or 50% over the prior year. International product sales for 2003 were $1,104.3 million, an increase of $609.8 million, or 123%, over the prior year. Excluding the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $166.2 million, international product sales increased 90% for the year ended December 31, 2003. EPOGEN®/Aranesp® Combined EPOGEN® and worldwide Aranesp® sales were $3,978.5 million for 2003. Combined EPOGEN® and worldwide Aranesp® sales increased $1,302.3 million, or 49%, over the prior year. These increases in combined sales were primarily driven by strong worldwide Aranesp® demand, reflecting the mid-year 2002 approval of Aranesp® for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in the United States and Europe. EPOGEN® sales for 2003 were $2,434.7 million, an increase of $174.1 million, or 8% over the prior year. The growth in reported EPOGEN® sales for 2003 was primarily due to demand and to a lesser extent, spillover (See “Summary of Critical Accounting Policies — EPOGEN® revenue recognition” and Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies — Product sales” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Demand was driven by growth in the dialysis patient population and improved patient outcomes. 28 Worldwide Aranesp® sales for 2003 were $1,543.8 million. Aranesp® sales in the United States for 2003 were $979.9 million, an increase of $695.2 million, or 244%, over the prior year. This increase was principally driven by demand, reflecting the mid-year 2002 launch of Aranesp® for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in the United States. International Aranesp® sales were $563.9 million for 2003, an increase of $433.0 million, or 331%, over the prior year. This increase was principally driven by demand, reflecting the mid-year 2002 launch of Aranesp® for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in Europe, and to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International Aranesp® sales growth for 2003 benefited by $87.0 million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Combined EPOGEN® and worldwide Aranesp® sales for 2002 were $2,676.2 million, an increase of $526.2 million or 24% over combined 2001 sales. The increase in combined sales was primarily driven by strong worldwide Aranesp® demand. EPOGEN® sales for 2002 were $2,260.6 million, an increase of $152.1 million or 7% over 2001 EPOGEN® sales. EPOGEN sales growth for 2002 was principally driven by demand, which includes the effect of higher prices and growth in the dialysis patient population. Worldwide Aranesp® sales for 2002 were $415.6 million, including U.S. sales of $284.7 million. Worldwide Aranesp® sales for 2002 were driven primarily by demand, and reflect the benefit of receiving the oncology indication in the United States midyear 2002. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® Combined worldwide Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® sales for 2003 were $2,521.7 million, an increase of $678.6 million, or 37%, over the prior year. The increase in combined sales for Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® for 2003 was primarily driven by U.S. demand for Neulasta® reflecting the April 2002 launch of Neulasta®. Worldwide Neulasta® sales for 2003 were $1,255.0 million, an increase of $791.5 million, or 171%, over the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by U.S. demand, which reflects the conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta® resulting from the April 2002 Neulasta® launch and, to a lesser extent, international demand, which reflects the January 2003 launch of Neulasta® in Europe. Worldwide NEUPOGEN® sales for 2003 were $1,266.7 million. Worldwide NEUPOGEN® sales decreased $112.9 million, or 8%, from the prior year. NEUPOGEN® sales in the United States for 2003 were $880.5 million, a decrease of $161.2 million, or 15%, from the prior year. This decrease was principally due to the conversion of patients from NEUPOGEN® to Neulasta®, which the Company believes has slowed. For 2003, international NEUPOGEN® sales were $386.2 million, an increase of $48.3 million, or 14%, over the prior year. This increase was entirely due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Combined Neulasta® and worldwide NEUPOGEN® sales in 2002 were $1,843.1 million, an increase of $496.7 million or 37%, over NEUPOGEN® only sales in the prior year. The increase in combined sales for Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® for 2002 was primarily driven by the U.S. launch of Neulasta® in April 2002 and patient population growth. Combined sales also benefited, to a lesser extent, from higher wholesaler inventory levels and higher NEUPOGEN® prices in the United States. Neulasta® sales in 2002 were $463.5 million which reflect the conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta® resulting from the April 2002 launch. Worldwide NEUPOGEN® sales in 2002 were $1,379.6 million, an increase of $33.2 million or 2% over the prior year NEUPOGEN® sales. In 2002, U.S. NEUPOGEN® sales were $1,041.7 million, a decrease of $8.9 million or 1% from 2001 sales. This decrease was primarily due to lower U.S. NEUPOGEN® demand, partially offset by higher wholesaler inventory levels. U.S. NEUPOGEN® demand declined at a mid-single digit rate from 2001 and was primarily impacted by the conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta®, partially offset by higher NEUPOGEN® prices in the United States. 29 ENBREL® ENBREL® sales for 2003 were $1,300.0 million, an increase of 259% over 2002 sales. The Company began recording ENBREL® sales on July 16, 2002, subsequent to the close of the Immunex acquisition. ENBREL® sales were primarily driven by the addition of new patients in both rheumatology and dermatology. For the period from July 16, 2002 through December 31, 2002, ENBREL® sales were $362.1 million and were adversely impacted by supply constraints. Royalty income Royalty income principally relates to amounts received from sales of Epoetin alfa by Johnson & Johnson in the United States for use in non-dialysis settings. Additionally, in December 2002 the Company licensed the commercialization rights for Novantrone® in the United States to Serono S.A. for royalties based on future product sales. Royalty income was $383.1 million for 2003, an increase of $51.6 million, or 16%, over the prior year. This increase was principally due to royalties earned from Serono S.A. relating to its sales of Novantrone®, partially offset by lower royalties earned from Johnson & Johnson relating to its sales of Epoetin alfa in the United States. Royalty income was $331.5 million in 2002, an increase of $78.8 million or 31% over the prior year. This increase was principally due to higher royalties earned from Johnson & Johnson relating to its sales of Epoetin alfa. Corporate partner revenues Corporate partner revenues were $104.7 million in 2003, a decrease of $95.6 million, or 48%, from the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower revenues earned from Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (“KA”) related to late-stage development programs conducted on behalf of KA (see Note 2 “Related party transactions” in the Consolidated Financial Statements). Corporate partner revenues were $200.3 million in 2002, a decrease of $51.7 million, or 21%, from the prior year. Corporate partner revenues include $174.6 million related to amounts earned from KA in 2002. The overall decrease in corporate partner revenues was primarily due to lower revenues earned from KA, and to a lesser extent, lower revenues earned under other collaboration agreements. Cost of sales Cost of sales for 2003 were $1,340.7 million, an increase of $605.0 million, or 82%, over the prior year, primarily due to higher sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was 17.0% and 14.7% for 2003 and 2002, respectively. This increase primarily reflects an increase of ENBREL® sales as a percentage of total product sales. ENBREL® has significantly higher manufacturing costs and royalty expense compared to the Company’s other products. Additionally, the manufacturing costs of the Rhode Island production facility, which began producing in December 2002, are greater than those of the Company’s contract manufacturer, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (“BI Pharma”). Cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was 14.7% and 12.6% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2002 was principally due to the impact of higher manufacturing costs and royalty expense related to ENBREL® compared to the Company’s other products. In addition, during 2002 the Company recorded the inventory acquired from Immunex at its estimated fair market value (see Note 3, “Immunex acquisition” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in fair market value was recognized as cost of sales as the acquired inventory was sold. Cost of sales for 2002 reflects a charge of $38.7 million related to the fair value adjustment to inventory, and $7.5 million of compensation costs payable under the Immunex Corporate Retention Plan. Research and development In 2003, research and development (“R&D”) expenses were $1,655.4 million an increase of $538.8 million, or 48%, over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to: 1) higher outside R&D costs, principally 30 licensing and milestone fees which include the Biovitrum AB up-front fee of $86.5 million, 2) higher staff-related costs, and 3) higher clinical manufacturing costs. In 2003, outside R&D costs, staff-related costs and clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately $252 million, $163 million, and $92 million, respectively. In 2002, R&D expenses increased $251.6 million or 29% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher staff-related costs and higher outside R&D costs, and to a lesser extent, higher clinical manufacturing costs as a result of the Immunex acquisition. In 2002, staff-related costs and outside R&D costs increased approximately $120 million and $90 million, respectively, and clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately $38 million. Staff-related costs in 2002 include approximately $18.1 million of compensation costs payable under the Immunex Corporate Retention Plan. Selling, general and administrative In 2003, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $1,952.6 million, an increase of $490.5 million, or 34%, over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher outside marketing expenses, which includes higher Wyeth profit share (see Note 11, “Agreements with Wyeth” in the Consolidated Financial Statements) as a result of ENBREL® sales growth, and higher staff-related costs to support new products in competitive markets and sales growth. In 2003, outside marketing expenses, which includes the Wyeth profit share, increased approximately $276 million and staff-related costs increased approximately $207 million. In 2002, SG&A expenses increased $491.4 million or 51% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher staff-related costs and outside marketing expenses as the Company increased its support for newly launched products and ENBREL®, and to a lesser extent, higher outside services. In 2002, staff-related costs increased approximately $225 million, outside marketing expenses increased approximately $217 million, and other outside services increased approximately $34 million. Staff-related costs increased in 2002 principally to support new product launches, from incremental expenses due to the addition of Immunex staff, and approximately $14.8 million of compensation costs principally payable under the Immunex Corporate Retention Plan. Outside marketing expenses in 2002 increased principally due to the launch of new products, marketing costs related to ENBREL®, and the impact of the profit share with Wyeth under the co-promotion agreement. Acquired in-process research and development In the third quarter of 2002, the Company incurred a one-time expense of $3.0 billion associated with writing off the acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) related to the Immunex acquisition. The amount expensed as IPR&D represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in-process technology for projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use (See Note 3 “Immunex acquisition” in the Consolidated Financial Statements). Amortization of intangible assets In 2003 and 2002, amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition was $335.8 million and $155.2 million, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets is provided over their estimated useful lives ranging from 7 to 15 years on a straight-line basis (weighted average amortization period of 14.7 years at December 31, 2003). Loss (earnings) of affiliates, net In 2003, Loss (earnings) of affiliates, net was a loss of $4.3 million, a decrease of $16.9 million from the prior year’s earnings of $12.6 million. The loss in 2003 was primarily due to a loss from KA in connection with KA’s obligation to indemnify the Company, pursuant to the terms of a license agreement, for the payment made to Genentech, Inc. to settle a patent litigation relating to the Company’s processes for producing NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta®. In 2003, the Company recorded $47.1 million as its share of the litigation loss incurred by KA, net of tax, in “Loss (earnings) of affiliates, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 31 Other items, net In 2003, other items, net consisted of a benefit for the recovery of costs and expenses associated with a legal award related to an arbitration proceeding with Johnson & Johnson of $74.0 million, partially offset by a charitable contribution to the Amgen Foundation of $50.0 million. In 2002, other items, net consisted of a one-time benefit of $40.1 million related to the recovery of certain expenses accrued in the fourth quarter of 2001 related to terminating collaboration agreements with various third parties and a legal award associated with the product license arbitration with Johnson & Johnson of $151.2 million, partially offset by a charitable contribution to the Amgen Foundation of $50.0 million. In 2001, other items, net primarily consisted of costs associated with the termination of collaboration agreements with various third parties, including PRAECIS PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED and certain academic institutions totaling $203.1 million. See Note 4, “Other items, net”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net In 2003, interest and other income, net decreased $30.8 million or 21% from the prior year. This decrease was principally due to lower interest income generated from the Company’s investment portfolio as a result of lower average interest rates and higher losses on foreign currency transactions. The decrease was partially offset by higher realized gains related to equity and fixed income securities. In 2002, interest and other income, net decreased $24.5 million or 15% from the prior year. This decrease was principally due to higher realized losses related to equity securities and higher losses on foreign currency transactions. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest income generated from the Company’s investment portfolio as a result of higher average cash balances. Higher average cash balances during 2002 offset the impact of lower average interest rates. Income taxes The Company’s effective tax rate was 28.8%, (103.3%) and 33.6% for 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively. The Company’s negative effective tax rate for 2002 was primarily due to the pre-tax loss resulting from the write-off of non-deductible IPR&D costs in connection with the acquisition of Immunex. Excluding the effect of the IPR&D write-off, the 2002 effective tax rate would have been 30.7%. During 2002, the Company restructured its Puerto Rico manufacturing operations using a controlled foreign corporation. As permitted in APB 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes — Special Areas”, the Company does not provide U.S. income taxes on the controlled foreign corporation’s undistributed earnings that are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. In addition, the Puerto Rico manufacturing operations were entitled to a possession tax credit for a portion of 2002. The Company’s effective tax rates for 2003 and 2002 reflected the permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings outside the United States. The 2003 effective tax rate of 28.8% was lower than the 2002 effective tax rate (excluding the effect of non-deductible IPR&D costs) of 30.7% primarily due to an increase in the amount of permanently reinvested foreign earnings partially offset by the loss of the possession tax credit. The Company’s 2002 effective tax rate (excluding the effect of non-deductible IPR&D costs) of 30.7% was lower than the 2001 effective rate of 33.6% primarily due to the Puerto Rico restructuring described above. See Note 5, “Income taxes”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of 32 those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. EPOGEN® revenue recognition The Company has the exclusive right to sell Epoetin alfa for dialysis, certain diagnostics, and all non-human, non-research uses in the United States. Amgen has granted to Johnson & Johnson a license relating to Epoetin alfa for sales in the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. Pursuant to this license, the Company and Johnson & Johnson are required to compensate each other for Epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party’s exclusive market, sometimes referred to as “spillover”. Accordingly, Amgen does not recognize product sales it makes into the exclusive market of Johnson & Johnson and does recognize the product sales made by Johnson & Johnson into Amgen’s exclusive market. Sales in Amgen’s exclusive market are derived from the Company’s sales to its customers, as adjusted for spillover. The Company is employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party’s spillover based on independent third-party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage. Data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques, and accordingly, the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover. The Company initially recognizes spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage, utilizing historical third-party data and subsequently adjusts such amounts based on revised third-party data as received. Differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based on revised third-party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized EPOGEN® sales. However, such differences to date have not been material. Deferred income taxes The Company’s effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested internationally based on the Company’s projected cash flow, working capital, and long-term investment requirements of its U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact the Company’s effective future tax rate. Financial Outlook Results of operations In the near-term, the Company expects growth of its businesses to be driven primarily by Aranesp®, Neulasta®, and ENBREL® (see “Forward looking statements and factors that may affect Amgen”). On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not determined the full impact of this new law on its business. However, the Company believes that legislation that reduces reimbursement for its products could adversely impact how much or under what circumstances healthcare providers will prescribe or administer its products and could negatively impact its business. (See “Forward looking statements and factors that may affect Amgen — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payors, and a reduction in the payment rate or reimbursement could result in decreased use or sales of our products.”) See “Products” in Item 1. Business for a discussion of our key products and their approved indications and “Selected Product Candidates” in Item 1. Business for a discussion of additional indications under development and subject to regulatory approval. Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, wholesaler inventory management practices, foreign exchange effects, new product launches and indications, competitive products, product supply, and acquisitions (See “Forward looking statements and factors that may affect Amgen”). 33 EPOGEN® The Company believes EPOGEN® sales growth will primarily depend on patient population growth. Patients receiving treatment for end stage renal disease are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government. The Company believes future EPOGEN® sales growth may also be affected by future changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government. EPOGEN® may compete with Aranesp® in the United States as health care providers may use Aranesp® to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of EPOGEN®. Aranesp® The Company believes future worldwide Aranesp® sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: reimbursement by third party payors (including governments and private insurance plans); the effects and pricing of competitive products or therapies; penetration of existing and new market opportunities; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, future worldwide sales growth may be affected by cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers. Neulasta®/ NEUPOGEN® The Company believes future worldwide Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: reimbursement by third-party payors (including governments and private insurance plans); penetration of existing markets; patient population growth; the conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta®; price increases; the effects of competitive products or therapies; the development of new treatments for cancer; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, future worldwide sales growth may be affected by cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers. Further, chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less Neulasta®/ NEUPOGEN®. NEUPOGEN® competes with Neulasta® in the United States and Europe. The Company believes that U.S. NEUPOGEN® sales have and will continue to be adversely impacted by the launch of Neulasta®. However, the Company believes that the conversion rate has naturally slowed in the U.S. due to the rapid adoption of Neulasta®. The Company believes that opportunity for conversion exists in Europe, but to a lesser extent than experienced in the United States. The Company cannot accurately predict the rate or timing of future conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta® worldwide. ENBREL® The Company believes that future sales growth of ENBREL® will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: limits on the current supply of and sources of ENBREL®; the effects of competing products or therapies; penetration of existing and new market opportunities, including potential new indications; and the availability and extent of reimbursement by third-party payors. Capital expenditures The Company currently estimates spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in 2004, primarily related to the new Rhode Island manufacturing plant and the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion. Trends expected to impact future operations Future operating results of the Company may be impacted by a number of factors. The following trends in our business are reasonably expected to impact our future liquidity and results of operations: • SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter are expected to increase over the previous three quarters in a trend similar to that seen in previous years. • reported sales in the first quarter for each of EPOGEN® and combined NEUPOGEN®/ Neulasta® have tended to be comparable or slightly less than respective reported sales in the fourth quarter of the previous year. 34 Forward looking statements and factors that may affect Amgen This report and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls, and conference calls. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume,” “continue,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We have based our forward looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied, or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, expenses, earnings per share, liquidity and capital resources, and trends. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or otherwise. The following items are representative of the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements. Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payors, and a reduction in the payment rate or reimbursement could result in decreased use or sales of our products. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors such as state and federal governments, under programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and private insurance plans. Medicare does not cover prescriptions for ENBREL®. In certain foreign markets, the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls. In the United States, there have been, there are, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of state and federal proposals that could limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of pharmaceutical and biologic products. On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. As of the date of this filing, we have not determined the full impact of this new law on our business. However, we believe that legislation that reduces reimbursement for our products could adversely impact how much or under what circumstances healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products, and could negatively impact our business. In addition, we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products, which may adversely impact product sales. Further, when a new therapeutic product is approved, the availability of governmental and/or private reimbursement for that product is uncertain, as is the amount for which that product will be reimbursed. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our approved products or product candidates, including those at a late stage of development, and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time. If reimbursement for our marketed products changes adversely or if we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement for our other current or future products, health care providers may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them, which could reduce the use of our products or cause us to reduce the price of our products. This could result in lower product sales or revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. For example, in the United States the use of EPOGEN® in connection with treatment for end-stage renal disease is funded primarily by the U.S. federal government. In early 1997, CMS, formerly known as HCFA, instituted a reimbursement change for EPOGEN® which materially and adversely affected our EPOGEN® sales until the policies were revised. 35 Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval. We conduct research, preclinical testing, and clinical trials and we manufacture and contract manufacture our product candidates. We also manufacture and contract manufacture, price, sell, distribute, and market or co-market our products for their approved indications. These activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, such as the FDA and CMS, as well as in foreign countries, including Europe. Currently, we are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from those countries’ regulatory authorities before we can manufacture (or have our third-party manufacturers produce product), market and sell our products in those countries. In our experience, obtaining regulatory approval is costly and takes many years, and after it is obtained, it remains costly to maintain. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials, require additional testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval, require changes in labeling of our products, and mandate product withdrawals. Substantially all of our marketed products are currently approved in the United States and most are approved in Europe and in other foreign countries for specific uses. We currently manufacture and market all our approved products, and we plan to manufacture and market many of our potential products. Even though we have obtained regulatory approval for our marketed products, these products and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, ENBREL® is manufactured both by us at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility and by a third-party contract manufacturer, BI Pharma, and fill and finish of bulk product produced at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility is done by third-party service providers. BI Pharma and these third-party service providers are subject to FDA regulatory authority. See “— Limits on supply for ENBREL® may constrain ENBREL® sales.” In addition, later discovery of unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers could result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, including potential withdrawal of the products from the market. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend, or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing or selling our marketed products until we or our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. In addition, if regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate, then they may not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. To date, there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed in such companies’ patents. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates, and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patents that they may claim prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly, and can preclude commercialization of products. We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in patent litigation. For example, we are involved in ongoing patent infringement lawsuits against Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (“TKT”) and Aventis with respect to our erythropoietin patents. If we lose or settle these or other litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be: subject to competition and/or significant liabilities; required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology; or required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 36 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. We have filed applications for a number of patents and have been granted patents or obtained rights relating to erythropoietin, recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, etanercept, and our other products and potential products (see “Patents and Trademarks” in Item 1. Business). We market our erythropoietin, recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, and etanercept products as EPOGEN®, NEUPOGEN®, Aranesp®, Neulasta®, and ENBREL®, respectively. We also have been granted or obtained rights to patents in Europe relating to: erythropoietin; G-CSF; pegfilgrastim (pegylated G-CSF); etanercept; two relating to darbepoetin alfa; and hyperglycosylated erythropoietic proteins. Our European patents relating to erythropoietin and G-CSF expire on December 12, 2004 and August 22, 2006, respectively, and we believe that after the expiration of these patents, other companies could develop and market new competitive products to our products in Europe; presenting additional competition to our products. While we do not market erythropoietin in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson & Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp® in the EU which competes with Johnson & Johnson’s and others’ erythropoietin products. We believe that the EU is currently in the process of developing regulatory requirements that would affect the development and approval of new competitive products. Until such requirements are finalized, we cannot predict when new competitive products could appear on the market in the EU or to what extent such additional competition would impact future Aranesp® and NEUPOGEN®/ Neulasta® sales in the EU. Limits on supply for ENBREL® may constrain ENBREL® sales. U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL® is impacted by many manufacturing variables, such as the timing and actual number of production runs, production success rate, bulk drug yield, and the timing and outcome of product quality testing. For example, in the second quarter of 2002, the prior co-marketer with respect to ENBREL®, experienced a brief period where no ENBREL® was available to fill patient prescriptions, primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from BI Pharma. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of ENBREL® to patients, we may lose patients, physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of ENBREL®, and ENBREL® sales will be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. See “— We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of ENBREL®; and our sources of supply are limited.” We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of ENBREL®; and our sources of supply are limited. We currently produce a substantial portion of annual ENBREL® supply at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility. However, we also depend on third parties for a significant portion of our ENBREL® supply as well as for the fill and finish of ENBREL® that we manufacture. BI Pharma is currently our sole third-party manufacturer of ENBREL® bulk drug; accordingly, our U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL® is currently significantly dependent on BI Pharma’s production schedule for ENBREL®. We would be unable to produce ENBREL® in sufficient quantities to substantially offset shortages in BI Pharma’s scheduled production if BI Pharma or other third-party manufacturers used for the fill and finish of ENBREL® bulk drug were to cease or interrupt production or services or otherwise fail to supply materials, products, or services to us for any reason, including due to labor shortages or disputes, due to regulatory requirements or action, or due to contamination of product lots or product recalls. This in turn could materially reduce our ability to satisfy demand for ENBREL®, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Factors that will affect our actual supply of ENBREL® at any time include, without limitation, the following: • BI Pharma does not produce ENBREL® continuously; rather, it produces the drug through a series of periodic campaigns throughout the year. Our Rhode Island manufacturing facility is currently dedicated to Enbrel® production. The amount of commercial inventory available to us at any time depends on a variety of factors, including the timing and actual number of BI Pharma’s production runs, the actual number of runs at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility, and, for either Rhode 37 Island or BI Pharma facilities, the level of production yields and success rates, the timing and outcome of product quality testing, and the amount of vialing capacity. • BI Pharma schedules the vialing production runs for ENBREL® in advance, based on the expected timing and yield of bulk drug production runs. Therefore, if BI Pharma realizes production yields beyond expected levels, or provides additional manufacturing capacity for ENBREL®, it may not have sufficient vialing capacity for all of the ENBREL® bulk drug that it produces. As a result, even if we are able to increase our supply of ENBREL® bulk drug, BI Pharma may not be able to fill and finish the extra bulk drug in time to prevent any supply interruptions. We are dependent on third parties for fill and finish of ENBREL® bulk drug manufactured at our Rhode Island facility. If third-party fill and finish manufacturers are unable to provide sufficient capacity or otherwise unable to provide services to us, then supply of ENBREL® could be adversely affected. Our current plan to increase U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL® includes construction of an additional large-scale cell culture commercial manufacturing facility adjacent to the current Rhode Island manufacturing facility. Additionally, we have entered into a manufacturing agreement with Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”) to produce ENBREL® at Genentech’s manufacturing facility in South San Francisco, California. These manufacturing facilities are subject to FDA approval. Under the terms of the agreement, Genentech is expected to produce ENBREL® through 2005, with an extension through 2006 by mutual agreement. However, certain milestones under the manufacturing agreement, including obtaining FDA approval for the manufacturing process, have not been met in the pre-agreed time frame and there can be no assurance that Genentech will be able to obtain the requisite FDA approval. If and when approval is received, ENBREL® bulk drug produced at the Genentech facility is expected to be produced in campaigns similar to those conducted at BI Pharma. Consequently, supply from the Genentech facility is expected to also be dependent on the timing and number of production runs in addition to the other manufacturing risk discussed above. In addition, Wyeth is constructing a new manufacturing facility in Ireland, which is expected to increase the U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL®. If the additional ENBREL® manufacturing capacity at the Rhode Island site, or at Genentech, or in Ireland are not completed on time, or if these manufacturing facilities do not receive FDA approval before we encounter supply constraints, our ENBREL® sales would be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See “— Limits on supply for ENBREL® may constrain ENBREL® sales.” Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. For example, ENBREL® competes in certain circumstances with rheumatoid arthritis products marketed by Abbott Laboratories/ Knoll, Centocor Inc./ Johnson & Johnson, Aventis, Pfizer, and Merck as well as the generic drug methotrexate, and may face competition from other potential therapies being developed. Further, if our currently marketed products are approved for new uses, or if we sell new products, we may face new, additional competition that we do not face today. For example, in the United States, Aranesp® competes with an Epoetin alfa product marketed by Johnson & Johnson in certain anemia markets and ENBREL®, if approved, may compete in certain circumstances with psoriasis products marketed by Biogen and Genentech, among others. Additionally, some of our competitors, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, market products or are actively engaged in research and development in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs approved for other indications that may be approved for the same indications as those of our products, and off-label use of drugs approved for other indications. Our European patents relating to erythropoietin and G-CSF expire on December 12, 2004 and August 22, 2006, respectively, and we believe that after the expiration of these patents, other companies could develop and market new competitive products to our products in Europe; presenting additional competition to our products. While we do not market erythropoietin in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson & Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp® in the EU which competes with Johnson & Johnson’s and others’ 38 erythropoietin products. We believe that the EU is currently in the process of developing regulatory requirements that would affect the development and approval of new competitive products. Until such requirements are finalized, we cannot predict when new competitive products could appear on the market in the EU or to what extent such additional competition would impact future Aranesp® and NEUPOGEN®/ Neulasta® sales in the EU. Our products may compete against products that have lower prices, superior performance, are easier to administer, or that are otherwise competitive with our products. Our inability to compete effectively could adversely affect product sales. Large pharmaceutical corporations may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop, and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. Business combinations among our competitors may also increase competition and the resources available to our competitors. Certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components are single-sourced from third parties; third-party supply failures could adversely affect our ability to supply our products. Certain raw materials necessary for commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Also, certain medical devices and components necessary for fill, finish, and packaging of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Certain of these raw materials, medical devices, and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third-party suppliers and, in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the FDA so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the FDA approved that other supplier. We would be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices, or components for an indeterminate period of time if these third-party single-source suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials or products to us for any reason, including due to regulatory requirements or action, due to adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier, or due to labor shortages or disputes. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and the formulation of our products are derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin, or HSA. We are investigating alternatives to certain biological sources. Raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, and/or recall could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This too, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Our product development efforts may not result in commercial products. We intend to continue an aggressive research and development program. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few research and development projects produce a commercial product. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development, such as in early human clinical trials, may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: • the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results • the product candidate was not effective in treating a specified condition or illness • the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans • the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use 39 • the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize • other companies or people have or may have proprietary rights to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all • the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics Several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process, including Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“BDNF”) and Megakaryocyte Growth and Development Factor (“MGDF”). For example, in 1997, we announced the failure of BDNF for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease, because the product candidate, when administered by injection, did not produce acceptable clinical results for a specific use after a phase 3 trial, even though BDNF had progressed successfully through preclinical and earlier clinical trials. In addition, in 1998, we discontinued development of MGDF, a novel platelet growth factor, at the phase 3 trial stage after several people in platelet donation trials developed low platelet counts and neutralizing antibodies. Of course, there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product. We cannot guarantee we will be able to produce commercially successful products. Further, clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists, medical personnel, regulatory personnel, statisticians, and others, which may delay, limit, or prevent further clinical development or regulatory approvals of a product candidate. Also, the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied by product and by the intended use of a product. We expect that this will likely be the case with future product candidates and we cannot predict the length of time to complete necessary clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval. See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval.” We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market. If we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products, and changes to or re-approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required, any of which could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. After any of our products are approved for commercial use, we or regulatory bodies could decide that changes to our product labeling are required. Label changes may be necessary for a number of reasons, including: the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns by regulatory agencies or the discovery of significant problems with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products. Any significant concerns raised about the safety or efficacy of our products could also result in the need to reformulate those products, to conduct additional clinical trials, to make changes to our manufacturing processes, or to seek re-approval of our manufacturing facilities. Significant concerns about the safety and effectiveness of one of our products could ultimately lead to the revocation of its marketing approval. The revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could be required even if there is no clearly established connection between the product and the safety or efficacy concerns that have been raised. The revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our business may be impacted by government investigations or litigation We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to various patent matters, government investigations, and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Matters required to be disclosed by us are set forth in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and are updated as required in subsequently filed Form 10-Qs. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts can occur. Consequently, it is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages 40 that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such amounts are incurred. The Federal government, state governments and private payors are investigating, and many have filed actions against, numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Amgen and Immunex, alleging that the reporting of prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in false and overstated Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”), which in turn is alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by Medicare beneficiaries, insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans and other payors to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products. Thirteen of these actions have been brought against us and/or Immunex, now a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. Eleven states and Puerto Rico have pending investigations regarding our drug pricing practices and the U.S. Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services have requested that Immunex produce documents relating to pricing issues. Further certain state government entity plaintiffs in some of these AWP cases are also alleging that companies, including ours, are not reporting their “best price” to the states under the Medicaid program. These cases and investigations are described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Average Wholesale Price Litigation” in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and are updated as required in subsequent Form 10-Qs. Other states and agencies could initiate investigations of our pricing practices. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions and/or investigations could result in substantial economic damages and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such amounts are incurred. We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims. Product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management’s attention, and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Our operating results may fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause financial results to be below expectations. Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. In budgeting our operating expenses, we assume that revenues will continue to grow; however, some of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term. Because of this, even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period’s results to be below our expectations or projections. A revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors, some of which we cannot control. For example, we may face: • lower than expected demand for our products • inability to provide adequate supply of our products • changes in the government’s or private payors’ reimbursement policies for our products • changes in wholesaler buying patterns • increased competition from new or existing products • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates • changes in our product pricing strategies Of these, we would only have control over changes in our product pricing strategies and, of course, there may be other factors that affect our revenues in any given period. 41 We have grown rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted. We have had an aggressive growth plan that has included substantial and increasing investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and facilities. We plan to continue to grow and our plan has a number of risks, some of which we cannot control. For example: • we will need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses, and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control • we will need to assimilate a large number of new employees • we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger and faster growing organization • we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity, and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control Of course, there may be other risks and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these or other risks. Our stock price is volatile, which could adversely affect your investment. Our stock price, like that of other biotechnology companies, is highly volatile. For example, in the fifty-two weeks prior to December 31, 2003, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $72.37 per share to a low of $48.09 per share. Our stock price may be affected by a number of factors, such as: • clinical trial results • adverse developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products • actual or anticipated product supply constraints • product development announcements by us or our competitors • regulatory matters • announcements in the scientific and research community • intellectual property and legal matters • changes in reimbursement policies or medical practices • broader industry and market trends unrelated to our performance In addition, if our revenues, earnings or other financial results in any period fail to meet the investment community’s expectations, there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price. Our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations. The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation. See “— Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval.” and “— We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.” While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on current best practices, we cannot assure you that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, including withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, or other sanctions or litigation. 42 Our marketing of ENBREL® will be dependent in part upon Wyeth. Under a co-promotion agreement, we and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL® in the United States and Canada. A management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from us and Wyeth is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL®: including strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing, and the establishment of a brand team. The brand team, with equal representation from us and Wyeth, will prepare and implement the annual marketing plan, which includes a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is responsible for all sales activities. If Wyeth fails to market ENBREL® effectively or if we and Wyeth fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, our sales of ENBREL® may be adversely affected. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the health care and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration, and use of related therapies. Organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and health care providers could result in decreased use of our products. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use of our products could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest income earned on the Company’s fixed income investment portfolio is impacted by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates upon reinvestment of funds received on maturity or sale of securities at the then current market rates. In 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements, which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges, to protect against possible reductions in value on certain of its available-for-sale investment portfolio. In 2003, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements, which also qualify and are designated as fair value hedges, to protect against possible increase in value of the Notes and the Century Notes. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the Company’s Notes, Century Notes and Convertible Notes because they bear interest at fixed rates. The following tables provide information about the Company’s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For the Company’s investment portfolio and debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Additionally, the Company has assumed its available-for-sale debt securities, comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities, are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes. For the interest rate swaps, the tables present the notional amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity date. For the interest rate swaps, variable rates are the average forward rates for the term of each contract. The notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract. 43 Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal (Notional) Amount by Expected Maturity as of December 31, 2003 (Dollars in millions) Average Interest Rate There- Fair value 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 after Total 12/31/03 Available-for-sale debt securities $ 2,076.9 $ 1,254.1 $ 667.3 $ 392.5 $ 476.5 $ — $ 4,867.3 $ 4,882.2 Average Interest rate 2.8 % 4.0 % 4.1 % 5.2 % 3.7 % — Medium and long-term notes — — — $ 100.0 — $ 100.0 $ 200.0 $ 249.3 Interest rate — — — 6.5 % — 8.1 % Convertible Notes(1) — $ 2,917.1 — — — — $ 2,917.1 $ 2,978.5 Interest rate — 1.125 % — — — — Interest rate swaps related to available-for-sale debt securities: Pay fixed/receive variable $ 25.0 $ 120.0 $ 25.0 — — — $ 170.0 $ (7.7 ) Average pay rate 3.9 % 4.2 % 4.5 % — — — Average receive rate 1.3 % 2.3 % 3.4 % — — — Interest rate swaps related to debt: Pay variable/receive fixed — — — $ 100.0 — $ 100.0 $ 200.0 $ (5.0 ) Average pay rate — — — 4.6 % — 5.1 % Average receive rate — — — 3.6 % — 5.5 % Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal Amount by Expected Maturity as of December 31, 2002 (Dollars in millions) Average Interest Rate There- Fair value 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 after Total 12/31/02 Available-for-sale debt securities $ 2,171.3 $ 1,072.8 $ 1,009.9 $ 164.9 $ 29.6 $ 3.0 $ 4,451.5 $ 4,534.7 Average interest rate 1.1 % 4.8 % 5.4 % 5.1 % 4.3 % 6.8 % Commercial paper obligations $ 100.0 — — — — — $ 100.0 $ 100.0 Interest rate 1.4 % — — — — — Medium and long-term notes $ 23.0 — — — $ 100.0 $ 100.0 $ 223.0 $ 273.6 Interest rate 6.2 % — — — 6.5 % 8.1 % Convertible Notes(1) — — $ 2,917.1 — — — $ 2,917.1 $ 2,913.5 Interest rate — — 1.125 % — — — Interest rate swaps related to available-for-sale debt securities: Pay fixed/receive variable $ 128.2 $ 80.7 $ 120.0 $ 40.0 — — $ 368.9 $ (14.9 ) Average pay rate 2.9 % 3.9 % 4.2 % 4.5 % — — Average receive rate 1.4 % 1.4 % 1.4 % 1.4 % — — (1) Holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates as early as March 1, 2005 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount (“accreted value”) through the purchase date. The amount above represents the accreted value on March 1, 2005. The accreted value based on the 30-year contractual maturity is $3.95 billion. In the 44 event the Company is required to repurchase the notes, it may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock. The Company is exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in its portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had equity forward contracts to hedge against changes in the fair market value of a portion of its equity investment portfolio. The Company did not have material equity price risk on the unhedged portion of its equity investment portfolio at December 31, 2003 and 2002. The Company did not have material exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to its foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002.",2023-12-30 18:05:23.422179
318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2006,"Item 7., “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for further information regarding our consolidated results of operations and financial position for periods reported therein and for known factors that will impact comparability of future results. (1) We began recording Enbrel® sales subsequent to our acquisition of Immunex Corporation in July 2002. (2) Included in operating expenses are acquisition charges of $12 million, $53 million, $70 million, and $87 million, in 2005, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Acquisition charges consist of the incremental compensation provided to certain employees under short-term retention plans, including non-cash compensation expense associated with stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition, non-cash expense related to valuing the inventory acquired at fair value, and external, incremental consulting and systems integration costs directly associated with integrating the acquisition. (3) As part of the accounting for the Tularik Inc. and Immunex Corporation acquisitions, we recorded a charge to write-off acquired IPR&D of $554 million in 2004 and $2,992 million in 2002, respectively. The IPR&D charge represents an estimate of the fair value of the in-process research and development for projects and technologies that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. 52 (4) In August 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Tularik Inc. for a purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. In July 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Immunex Corporation for a purchase price of approximately $17.8 billion. (5) In March 2002, we issued convertible notes with a face amount at maturity of $3.95 billion. Holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates, the earliest of which was March 1, 2005, at the accreted principal amount through the purchase dates. On March 2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their March 1, 2005 put option, we repurchased $1.2 billion, or approximately 40%, of the outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for cash. Accordingly, the convertible notes repurchased were classified as current liabilities at December 31, 2004. Holders of the remaining outstanding convertible notes may require us to purchase, generally for cash, all or a portion of the notes on various dates at a price equal to the accreted principal amount through the purchase date. The next available put date was March 1, 2006, however, the holders of substantially all of the then outstanding convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on this date. The next date that the holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of these notes is on March 1, 2007. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2005, the convertible notes have been classified as non-current liabilities. (6) In November 2004, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due in 2009 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.85% senior notes due in 2014. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward looking statements This report and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls, and conference calls.

Overview The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We are a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. As a science-based, patient-focused organization, we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat grievous illness. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of inflammation, nephrology and supportive cancer care. For the year ended December 31, 2005, total revenues were $12,430 million and net income was $3,674 million, or $2.93 per share on a diluted basis. As of December 31, 2005, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $5,255 million. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, product sales represented 97% and 95% of total revenues, respectively. Over the last several years, our product sales growth has been primarily driven by sales of Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa), Enbrel® (etanercept), and Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), which have benefited from share gains and/or market growth. We expect these products to continue to drive year over year sales growth in the near term. However, we expect that continued share gains will be more of a challenge than those achieved in previous years as we operate in a highly competitive environment. (See “Competition” in “Item 1. Business” for further information on the impact of competition on our business.) Going forward, we will continue to focus on share gains, but we will also increase our focus on both growing and penetrating the therapeutic areas in which our products are used. Our principal products have 54 attained significant sales levels, and for certain of our products, in a relatively short period of time. As a result, although we have experienced significant year over year sales growth as a result of share gains and/or market growth, in the near term, we expect our product sales growth to be lower than that achieved in the past several years. Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by both government and private payer health care programs. (Through 2005, primary reimbursement for ENBREL was obtained from private payers but, beginning in 2006, ENBREL and Sensipar® will be eligible for coverage from the U.S. government under Medicare Program Part D.) Therefore, our principal product sales and sales growth are and will be affected by government and private payer reimbursement policies. While we believe that our 2005 product sales were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (or the “Medicare Modernization Act” (“MMA”)) that went into effect in 2005, additional provisions of the MMA and other regulations affecting reimbursement that went into effect on January 1, 2006 could affect our product sales and related sales growth in the future. However, we believe that such changes are not likely to be significant to our business in 2006. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see “Reimbursement” in “Item 1. Business”. International product sales for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 represented 18% and 17% of total product sales and consisted principally of European sales. International product sales have grown significantly over the last several years driven by Aranesp® and Neulasta® reflecting continued penetration. However, we anticipate facing greater competition in Europe from the availability of biosimilar products. We expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the European Union (“EU”) beginning in late 2006 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval which would compete with Aranesp®. We also expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved as early as mid-2007 and that it would compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim). We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products would impact future Aranesp®, Neulasta® or NEUPOGEN® sales in the EU. (See “Competition” in “Item 1. Business” for further information regarding biosimilar products.) In order to maintain commercial success in Europe, we plan to continue to support the development of new standards of care and continue to actively convert NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta®, emphasizing its less frequent dosing requirements as compared to NEUPOGEN®. Our international product sales are impacted by foreign currency changes (see “Results of Operations” discussion below). International product sales growth during 2005 and 2004 benefited by $46 million and $164 million, respectively, from foreign currency exchange rate changes. During 2005, international product sales for the first three quarters of the year benefited from foreign currency exchange rate changes, but were adversely affected in the fourth quarter. However, both the positive and negative impacts that movements in foreign exchange rates have on our international product sales are mitigated, in part, by the natural, opposite impact these exchange rate movements have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our net income. As such, the impact to our net results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated. For 2005 and 2004, operating income increased $1,500 million and $257 million over their respective prior year periods, primarily as a result of our product sales growth. Operating income as a percentage of product sales was 40% for 2005 and 34% for 2004. Operating income for 2004 was impacted by the IPR&D charge of $554 million relating to the acquisition of Tularik during 2004 (see Note 7, “Acquisitions” in the Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2005, we increased our operating expenses to advance our product pipeline and support our product sales growth. During 2005, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of product sales decreased from 26% to 23% as we leveraged our prior year SG&A spending. In 2006, we expect our R&D expenses to grow 30-40%, principally as a result 55 of significant increases in our clinical development activities discussed below. To support this increased investment in our pipeline, SG&A expenses in 2006 are expected to grow at a rate comparable to the 2005 growth rate. As a result of the significant anticipated growth in R&D expenses, we expect our 2006 operating expenses to grow at a higher rate than our anticipated 2006 product sales growth. We focus our R&D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness. (See “Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates” in “Item 1. Business” for further information on our R&D vision and product pipeline.) In December 2005, we signed a definitive merger agreement under which we will pay shareholders of Abgenix, Inc. (“Abgenix”) $22.50 in cash per common share for a total value of approximately $2.2 billion and will assume Abgenix’s outstanding debt. Abgenix is a company specializing in the discovery, development and manufacture of human therapeutic antibodies and is our co-development partner for panitumumab. The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger on January 19, 2006 and we expect to close the merger, subject to Abgenix shareholder approval, by April 2006. (See “Joint Ventures and Business Relationships — Abgenix, Inc.” in “Item 1. Business” for further information on the co-development agreement with Abgenix.) We have expanded and will need to continue to significantly expand our clinical development resources, including human capital, to manage and execute increasingly larger and more complex clinical trials. In 2006, we are expecting a significant increase in the number, size, duration and complexity of our clinical trials, in particular with respect to denosumab, our late-stage investigational product for osteoporosis, and we expect total research and development expenses to increase by 30-40%. For example, testing denosumab in the osteoporosis setting requires large clinical trials, substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. We expect to start eleven “mega-site” trials (involving 200 or more sites) in 2006 to support denosumab and our other late-stage programs. To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to accelerate the growth of our development organization, implement new management structures and approaches and increase dependence on third-party contract clinical trial providers. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we are planning to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, China, India and some South American countries. We plan to conduct clinical trial activities in these new territories through third-party contract clinical trial providers. There are many economic and industry-wide factors that affect our business, including, among others, those relating to increased complexity and cost of R&D, increasingly intense competition for our currently marketed products and product candidates, broad reimbursement changes, complex and expanding regulatory requirements, and intellectual property protection. (See “Item 1. Business” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information on these economic and industry-wide factors and their impact and potential impact on our business.) In addition to these economic and industry-wide factors, we, as a company, face certain additional challenges and have a number of opportunities as well. We have established leadership positions with all of our principal products, attaining significant sales levels, and for certain of our products, in a relatively short period of time. As a result, we expect our product sales growth rates in the near term will be lower than those achieved in the past several years. We expect increasing competition internationally as the first biosimilar products may be available in Europe shortly after the anticipated approval in late 2006 and in the anemia area worldwide, as the related business opportunities are significant and growing. We believe that future sales growth for certain of our principal products should benefit from increased penetration and market growth through new areas of treatment and/or greater awareness. Further, over the last several years, our pipeline has substantially increased and with that comes the challenge of delivering on the pipeline, including executing on large and complex clinical trials. Our strategy to overcome these challenges and to be successful in taking advantage of our opportunities is straightforward. We plan to: · Focus solely on human therapeutics 56 · Invest heavily in R&D and be productive · Pursue organic growth supplemented by external investments and partnerships · Secure and defend our intellectual property · Hire and retain the best people In the near term, our 2006 objectives are straightforward as well. We intend to balance short-term financial performance with significant R&D investment to drive long-term growth. We plan to grow our markets and hold or increase share. We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property and plan to take steps to grow our anemia business. We will continue to proactively manage and expand our production capacity ensuring that our commercial and clinical manufacturing is reliable and not subject to a single-point failure. As always, compliance with regulations and laws is of the utmost importance to us and we intend to sustain and enhance our very good compliance record. Lastly, remaining entrepreneurial, aggressive, and patient-focused as we grow larger will enable us to fulfill these objectives and our mission to serve patients. Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, total product sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Total U.S. $ 9,892 19 % $ 8,279 22 % $ 6,764 Total International 2,130 25 % 1,698 54 % 1,104 Total product sales. $ 12,022 20 % $ 9,977 27 % $ 7,868 Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, pricing strategies, wholesaler and end-user inventory management practices, foreign exchange effects, new product launches and indications, competitive products, product supply, and acquisitions. (See “Principal Products” in “Item 1. Business” for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) Sales growth in 2005 was principally driven by demand for Aranesp®, ENBREL, and Neulasta®, which have benefited from share gains and/or market growth. International product sales growth benefited by $46 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. During 2005, the first three quarters of the year benefited from foreign currency exchange rate changes, but were adversely affected in the fourth quarter. Sales growth in 2004 was principally driven by demand for Aranesp®, ENBREL, and Neulasta®. U.S. sales for Aranesp® and Neulasta® were impacted by higher incentives earned by customers under performance-based contracts. International product sales growth benefited by $164 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. We expect Aranesp®, ENBREL, and Neulasta® to continue to drive year over year sales growth in the near term. However, we expect that continued share gains will be more of a challenge than those achieved in previous years as we operate in a highly competitive environment. Going forward, we will continue to focus on share gains, but we will also increase our focus on both growing and penetrating the therapeutic areas in which our products are used. 57 In 2005, we believe that our product sales were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA. We believe this was, in part, due to the effects of CMS’s oncology demonstration project (the “2005 Demonstration Project”) on sales of our products used in supportive cancer care, especially Aranesp®. Furthermore, we believe this was also, in part, due to increased reimbursement rates to physicians from CMS for services associated with drug administration. The 2005 Demonstration Project, which provided financial incentives to physicians for collecting and reporting oncology patient survey data, expired on December 31, 2005. In November 2005, CMS announced a new demonstration project (the “2006 Demonstration Project”) that uses different criteria for how patients with cancer are evaluated and treated and that is targeted at approximately half of the funding originally targeted for the 2005 Demonstration Project. The final rule for the 2006 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule issued in November 2005 reduced payments for physician services in 2006 by approximately 4.4% on average. However recently passed legislation will eliminate this reduction for 2006. Because we cannot accurately predict the impact of any such changes on how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products, we cannot estimate the full impact of the MMA on our business. However, we believe that it is not likely to be significant to our business in 2006. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see “Reimbursement” in “Item 1. Business.” Aranesp® For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Aranesp® — U.S. $ 2,104 37 % $ 1,533 56 % $ 980 Aranesp® — International 1,169 24 % 940 67 % 564 Total Aranesp® $ 3,273 32 % $ 2,473 60 % $ 1,544 The increase in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily driven by market growth and share gains. Sales growth for 2005 was slightly impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. Although the ASPs for U.S. Aranesp® trended downward during 2005, we believe that they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005. In 2005, Aranesp® usage in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics increased, reflecting a conversion from EPOGEN® (Epoetin alfa). This conversion is expected to stabilize by mid 2006. International Aranesp® sales growth for 2005 was principally driven by demand, benefiting only slightly, $20 million, from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was driven by demand, which benefited from share gains in both oncology and nephrology and market growth. Sales growth was impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. The increase in international Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was principally driven by demand, and to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International Aranesp® sales growth for 2004 also benefited by $92 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. For 2006, we believe Aranesp® sales growth will be driven primarily by market growth and greater penetration from extended dosing. However, we believe future worldwide Aranesp® sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: reimbursement by third-party payers (including governments and private insurance plans) (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”); cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines 58 relating to the use of our products; government programs such as the 2006 Demonstration Project; penetration of new and existing markets; patient population growth; the effects of pricing strategies; competitive products or therapies, including biosimilar products in Europe; the development of new treatments for cancer; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Further, sales of Aranesp® have been and may continue to be benefited by its use in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of EPOGEN®. This conversion is expected to stabilize by mid 2006. EPOGEN® 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 (Amounts in millions) EPOGEN® — U.S. $ 2,455 (6 )% $ 2,601 7 % $ 2,435 EPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased primarily due to lower demand, unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventory levels, and an unfavorable revised estimate of dialysis demand, primarily spillover, for prior quarters. Demand for 2005 was affected by conversion to Aranesp® in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics, which has represented approximately 10% of the EPOGEN® business, and reflects higher sales incentives. This conversion to Aranesp® is expected to stabilize by mid 2006. Demand for EPOGEN® in the freestanding dialysis clinics remains consistent with patient population growth at approximately 3% to 4%. Spillover is a result of our contractual relationship with Johnson & Johnson (see “Summary of Critical Accounting Policies — EPOGEN® revenue recognition” and Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies — Product sales” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For the year ended December 31, 2004, the growth in reported EPOGEN® sales was primarily driven by demand, which reflects dialysis patient population growth and a continued focus in the renal community on patient outcomes, and to a lesser extent, increases in wholesaler inventory levels. We believe EPOGEN® should experience sales growth in 2006 primarily as a result of patient population growth and the stabilization of conversion to Aranesp® in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics by mid 2006. Patients receiving treatment for anemia associated with end stage renal disease with EPOGEN® are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government. Therefore, we believe EPOGEN® sales growth will further depend on changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”). We believe EPOGEN® sales growth will also be dependent, in part, on future governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products, cost containment pressures from the federal government on health care providers and the effects of pricing. 59 Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, total Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim) sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Neulasta® — U.S. $ 1,900 29 % $ 1,476 26 % $ 1,175 NEUPOGEN® — U.S. 805 3 % 778 (12 )% 881 U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total 2,705 20 % 2,254 10 % 2,056 Neulasta® — International 388 47 % 264 230 % 80 NEUPOGEN® — International 411 4 % 397 3 % 386 International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total 799 21 % 661 42 % 466 Total Worldwide Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® $ 3,504 20 % $ 2,915 16 % $ 2,522 The increase in U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta®, which benefited from recent guidelines recommending earlier use. U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales, Neulasta® in particular, also benefited from a label extension based on new clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use in moderate risk chemotherapy regimens. In addition, U.S. sales growth was slightly impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. Although the ASPs for U.S. Neulasta® have trended downward during 2005, we believe that they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2005, was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta®. International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for 2005 also benefited by $18 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. The increase in U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily driven by demand for Neulasta®, which benefited from new clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use. Sales growth was impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. The increase in international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to demand for Neulasta®, which reflects continued market penetration since the January 2003 launch of Neulasta® in Europe, and to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales growth for 2004 benefited by $65 million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that 2006 sales growth for Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® will be primarily driven by greater first cycle use due to increased awareness of febrile neutropenia. However, future worldwide Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: reimbursement by third-party payers (including governments and private insurance plans) (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”); cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; government programs such as the 2006 Demonstration Project; penetration of existing markets; patient population growth; the effects of pricing strategies; competitive products or therapies, including follow-on biologic products in Europe; the development of new treatments for cancer; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Future chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®, however, other future chemotherapy treatments that are more myelosuppressive, such as dose dense chemotherapy, could require more Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®. NEUPOGEN® competes with Neulasta® in the United States and Europe. U.S. NEUPOGEN® sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to 60 Neulasta®. However, we believe that most of the conversion in the United States has occurred. In Europe, we plan to continue actively converting NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta®, emphasizing its less frequent dosing requirements as compared to NEUPOGEN®. However, we cannot accurately predict the rate or timing of future conversion of NEUPOGEN® patients to Neulasta® in Europe. ENBREL For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 ENBREL — U.S. $ 2,470 35 % $ 1,827 46 % $ 1,254 ENBREL — International 103 41 % 73 59 % 46 Total ENBREL $ 2,573 35 % $ 1,900 46 % $ 1,300 ENBREL sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was driven by demand, reflecting strong growth in both rheumatology and dermatology. ENBREL sales growth has benefited from its competitive profile and significant growth of biologics in both the rheumatology and dermatology settings. In dermatology, ENBREL has grown significantly since its approval for moderate to severe psoriasis in April of 2004 and is the number one prescribed systemic therapy in this area. We believe 2006 sales growth will be driven by increased penetration in both the rheumatology and dermatology settings and as a result of ENBREL being eligible for coverage from the U.S. government under Medicare Program Part D beginning in 2006. However, future ENBREL sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: the effects of competing products or therapies; penetration of existing and new markets, including potential new indications; the availability and extent of reimbursement by government and third-party payers; and governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products”). Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes selected operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Product sales $ 12,022 20 % $ 9,977 27 % $ 7,868 Operating expenses: Cost of sales (excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets) $ 2,082 20 % $ 1,731 29 % $ 1,341 % of product sales 17 % 17 % 17 % Research and development $ 2,314 14 % $ 2,028 23 % $ 1,655 % of product sales 19 % 20 % 21 % Write-off of acquired in-process research and development — $ 554 — Selling, general and administrative $ 2,790 9 % $ 2,556 31 % $ 1,957 % of product sales 23 % 26 % 25 % 61 Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets (see “Consolidated Statements of Operations”), increased 20% for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to higher sales volumes. Costs of sales for 2005 was also impacted by the $47 million write-off of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that will not be used due to a change in manufacturing strategy. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2006 is expected to be comparable to 2005. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased 29% primarily driven by higher sales volumes, and to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs due to changes in the product mix. Research and development R&D expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with R&D personnel, overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services, and other outside costs. R&D expenses increased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily driven by higher staff-related costs, which included the full year integration of the Tularik operations and the buildup of our R&D organization to support the growth in our pipeline. The 2005 growth also reflects higher costs relating to key clinical trials and clinical manufacturing, including the continued ramp up of large-scale phase 3 trials for denosumab (formally known as AMG 162), Amgen’s investigational therapy for bone loss. In 2005, staff-related costs and clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately $171 million and $118 million, respectively. In 2006, we expect our total R&D expenses to increase 30-40% primarily due to higher staff-related costs and a significant increase in clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs. Staff-related costs are expected to increase due to a significant increase in personnel throughout 2006. Clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs are expected to increase due to several large ongoing late-stage clinical trials initiated in 2005 as well as additional planned trials for 2006. These include trials in denosumab, panitumumab, AMG 706, Aranesp®, Sensipar®, and ENBREL (see “Item 1. Business — Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates.”) Our expected increase in R&D costs for 2006 does not include any incremental R&D costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Abgenix (see “Item 1. Business — Joint Ventures and Business Relationships — Abgenix, Inc.”) In 2004, R&D expenses increased 23% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher staff-related costs including the addition of R&D personnel from Tularik, and to a lesser extent, higher costs relating to clinical manufacturing and key clinical trials costs, including the commencement of large-scale phase 3 trials for AMG 162, Amgen’s investigational therapy for bone loss. In 2004, staff-related costs and clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs increased approximately $233 million and $122 million, respectively. Acquired in-process research and development IPR&D represents an estimate of the fair value of the various R&D projects and technologies in the acquired company’s pipeline that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. In 2004, we incurred a charge of $554 million, associated with writing off the fair value of IPR&D acquired in the Tularik acquisition (see Note 7, “Acquisitions” in the Consolidated Financial Statements). Assuming successful completion of the proposed acquisition of Abgenix expected to close by April 2006, we would expect to incur a charge for IPR&D. However, the amount of this charge has not yet been determined. 62 Selling, general and administrative SG&A expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal, and other administrative personnel; outside marketing expenses; overhead and occupancy costs; and other general and administrative costs. SG&A increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to higher outside marketing expenses in support of our principal products. Outside marketing expenses include the Wyeth profit share related to ENBREL, which has increased due to ENBREL sales growth. In 2005, outside marketing expenses and staff-related costs increased approximately $241 million and $42 million, respectively. During 2005, SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased from 26% to 23% as we leveraged our prior year SG&A spending. In 2006, we expect higher Wyeth profit share expense due to expected ENBREL sales growth. However, total SG&A expense growth for 2006 is expected to be comparable to 2005 growth to allow greater investment in the pipeline. In 2004, SG&A increased 31% for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to higher staff-related costs and higher outside marketing expenses, which reflects higher spending to support our products in competitive markets and sales growth. In 2004, staff-related costs and outside marketing expenses increased approximately $255 million and $236 million, respectively. Other items, net In 2005, other items, net consisted of a $49 million charge, net of amounts previously accrued, for settling certain legal matters associated with a patent legal proceeding. In 2003, other items, net consisted of a benefit for the recovery of costs and expenses associated with a legal award related to an arbitration proceeding with Johnson & Johnson of $74 million, partially offset by a charitable contribution to the Amgen Foundation of $50 million. (See Note 12, “Other items, net”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 24.5%, 30.4%, and 28.8% for 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2005 has decreased primarily due to favorable resolution of prior year foreign tax credit claims and research and development tax credits with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and the absence of the write-off of non-deductible IPR&D costs in connection with the acquisition of Tularik in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by the tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The 2004 effective tax rate was higher than the 2003 effective tax rate due to the write-off of non-deductible IPR&D costs of $554 million in connection with the acquisition of Tularik. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. As permitted in Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes — Special Areas”, we do not provide U.S. income taxes on our controlled foreign corporations’ undistributed earnings that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. On October 22, 2004, the President of the United States signed the American Jobs Creation Act, which provided a temporary incentive to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings. One provision of the American Jobs Creation Act effectively reduced the tax rate by providing an 85% dividend-received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million of foreign earnings, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate. The tax expense incurred on the repatriation was approximately $43 million. (See Note 3, “Income taxes”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) 63 Stock option expense In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (‘SFAS”) No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment.” Subsequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) provided for a phase-in implementation process for SFAS No. 123R, which required us to adopt the new accounting standard no later than January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123R requires us to account for our stock options using a fair-value-based method as described in such statement and recognize the resulting compensation expense in our financial statements. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our employee stock options using the intrinsic value method under APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related Interpretations, which generally results in no employee stock option expense. We adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and do not plan to restate our financial statements for prior periods. We plan to continue to use the Black-Scholes option valuation model in estimating the fair value of the stock option awards issued under SFAS No. 123R. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have a material impact on our results of operations. The actual annual stock option expense in 2006 is dependent on a number of factors including the number of stock options granted, our common stock price and related expected volatility, and other inputs utilized in estimating the fair value of the stock options at the time of grant. We expect the impact of stock option compensation expense to be in the range of $0.12 to $0.14 per share in 2006 compared to $0.19 for 2005 (see Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies — Employee stock options” in the Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated impact of stock option expense for 2006 is less than the corresponding pro forma expense amount for 2005 principally due to a reduction in the estimated number of stock options to be granted in 2006 in favor of a combination of other equity awards. Other equity awards are comprised of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance units. Stock-based compensation expense relating to these other equity awards for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $106 million and $45 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2003, stock-based compensation expense relating to other equity awards was not significant. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data (amounts in millions): December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 5,255 $ 5,808 Total assets 29,297 29,221 Current debt — 1,173 Non-current debt 3,957 3,937 Stockholders’ equity 20,451 19,705 We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations, and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, as well as to support our stock repurchase programs and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities (see “Item 1. Business — Joint Ventures and Business Relationships — Abgenix, Inc.” for further discussion regarding the proposed Abgenix acquisition). However, in order to provide for greater financial flexibility and liquidity, we may raise additional capital from time to time by accessing both public and private markets. (See “Financing Arrangements” for a discussion regarding February 2006 financing activities.) Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities Of the total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2005, approximately $3.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the 64 United States. If these funds are repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, additional taxes on certain of these amounts would be required to be paid. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million of foreign earnings, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate under the American Jobs Act. The repatriation of these funds resulted in an increase in our tax provision of $43 million. The primary objectives for our marketable securities portfolio, which is primarily comprised of fixed income investments, are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return, consistent with these two objectives. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. Financing arrangements As of December 31, 2005 we had convertible notes (30-year, zero-coupon convertible notes) with an accreted value of $1.8 billion outstanding and having an aggregate face amount of $2.36 billion and yield to maturity of 1.125% (“convertible notes”). The holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase, generally for cash, all or a portion of their convertible notes on various dates (the “Put Option”), at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount through the purchase date. The earliest date was on March 1, 2006, however, the holders of substantially all of the convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on that date. The next date that the holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of these notes is on March 1, 2007. Accordingly, the convertible notes were classified as non-current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. Holders of the convertible notes may convert each of their convertible notes according to the terms as outlined in Note 4, “Financing arrangements” in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rate our outstanding convertible notes A2 and A+, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 we had $2.0 billion of long-term notes outstanding. These long-term notes consisted of: 1) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.0% and mature in 2009 (the “2009 Notes,”), and 2) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.85% and mature in 2014 (the “2014 Notes.”) Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rate our outstanding long-term senior notes A2 and A+, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, we had $200 million of additional long-term debt securities outstanding. These long-term debt securities consisted of: 1) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.5% and mature in 2007 (the “2007 Notes”) under a $500 million debt shelf registration (the “$500 Million Shelf”), and 2) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.1% and mature in 2097 (the “Century Notes”). Our outstanding long-term debt is rated A2 by Moody’s and A+ by Standard & Poor’s. Under the $500 Million Shelf, all of the remaining $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. In February 2006, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the “2011 Convertible Notes”) and $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the “2013 Convertible Notes”) in a private placement. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.125% and 0.375%, respectively. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may be convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 12.5247 shares and 12.5814 shares, respectively, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $79.84 and $79.48 per share, respectively). The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may only be converted: 1) during any calendar quarter beginning after June 30, 2006 if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the respective conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous quarter, 2) if we make specified distributions to holders 65 of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur, or 3) one month prior to the respective maturity date. Upon conversion, a holder would receive: 1) cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value, as defined, and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of common stock and cash, at our option (the “excess conversion value”). In addition, upon a change in control, as defined, the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes for 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A total of $3.0 billion of the net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program. Concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash from the counterparties to the transactions equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes upon conversion. These transactions will terminate the earlier of the maturity dates of the related notes or the first day none of the related notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. The convertible note hedges, which cost an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion, will be recorded as a reduction of equity. Also concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $107.90 per share in a private placement. Pursuant to these transactions, warrants for 31.3 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2011 and warrants for 31.5 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2013 (the “settlement dates”). If the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be settled, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. We have a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support, which matures in November 2010. Additionally, we have a commercial paper program, which provides for unsecured, short-term borrowings of up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility or commercial paper program as of December 31, 2005. We have a $1.0 billion shelf registration (the “$1 Billion Shelf”) which allows us to issue debt securities, common stock, and associated preferred share purchase rights, preferred stock, warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, securities purchase contracts, securities purchase units and depositary shares. The $1 Billion Shelf was established to provide for further financial flexibility and the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2005, no securities had been issued under the $1 Billion Shelf. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and as of December 31, 2005, we are in compliance with all applicable covenants. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (amounts in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,911 $ 3,697 $ 3,567 Net cash used in investing activities (59 ) (1,399 ) (3,210 ) Net cash used in financing activities (4,538 ) (1,609 ) (1,372 ) 66 Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by the growth in product sales and timing differences of cash payments relating to our tax and other accrued liabilities (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). The increase in cash provided by operations for 2004 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by growth in product sales. This increase was partially offset primarily by the timing of cash payments related to our tax liabilities (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). Investing Capital expenditures totaled $867 million in 2005 compared with $1.3 billion in 2004 and $1.4 billion in 2003. Capital expenditures in 2005 primarily related to the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion which included a new manufacturing plant for the commercial production of Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® approved by the FDA in September 2005, Thousand Oaks site expansion, Colorado manufacturing expansion, and site development to support the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, also approved by the FDA in September 2005. Capital expenditures in 2004 primarily related to the Thousand Oaks site expansion, the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, and the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion. Capital expenditures in 2003 related to the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion, and the Seattle research center which was completed in January 2004. We currently estimate 2006 spending on capital projects and equipment to be in excess of $1 billion as we continue to increase our manufacturing and R&D operations globally. The most significant of these expenditures are expected to be incurred with the start of engineering and construction of a new process development, bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill, and finish facility in Ireland, the further expansion of the Puerto Rico bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill, and finish facilities, the expansion of R&D operations at existing sites in the United States and the United Kingdom and the construction of a new development center in Uxbridge, United Kingdom. For additional information on our planned capital projects, see “Item 1. Business — Manufacturing and Raw Materials.” In addition, we expect to spend approximately $2.2 billion by the end of April 2006, in conjunction with our proposed acquisition of Abgenix. We will also assume Abgenix’s debt in connection with this proposed transaction. 67 Financing In December 2004, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized us to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of common stock. Additionally, in December 2005, the Board authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock. As of December 31, 2005, $6.5 billion was available for stock repurchases under these programs. The manner of purchases, amount we spend, and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. Repurchases under our stock repurchase programs reflect, in part, our confidence in the long-term value of Amgen common stock. Additionally, we believe that it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders. A summary of our repurchase activity for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 is as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars First quarter 26.8 $ 1,675 10.1 $ 650 8.2 $ 451 Second quarter 12.1 750 17.4 1,000 7.3 449 Third quarter 9.5 769 24.0 1,398 4.8 323 Fourth quarter 14.8 1,236 17.6 1,024 9.4 578 Total 63.2 $ 4,430 69.1 $ 4,072 29.7 $ 1,801 (See “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters — Item 5(c). Changes in Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information regarding our stock repurchase programs.) On March 2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their March 1, 2005 put option, we repurchased $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1.2 billion in cash, or approximately 40%, of the outstanding convertible notes. We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan. Employee stock option exercises and proceeds from the sale of stock by us pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans provided $1.1 billion, $453 million, and $529 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. In November 2004, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due 2009 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.85% senior notes due 2014. The net proceeds totaled $1,989 million and were intended for purchases of stock under the stock repurchase program then in affect and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital. In February 2006, we raised $5.0 billion of cash proceeds by issuing convertible notes at par in a private placement. Of the $5.0 billion convertible notes, $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.125 percent and are due in 2011 and $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.375 percent and are due in 2013. A total of $3.0 billion of the net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program. Concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes, we purchased convertible note hedges at a cost of approximately $1.5 billion. Also in February 2006, we sold 62.8 million warrants to acquire shares of our common stock for proceeds of $774 million, 31.3 million of which may be settled in May 2011 and 31.5 million of which may be settled in May 2013. For further information on these transactions, see “Financing arrangements” above. 68 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Accordingly, the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties and purchase price consideration for proposed mergers and acquisitions (see “Item 1. Business — Joint Ventures and Business Relationships — Abgenix, Inc.”), all of which are contingent upon certain future events. Such events could include, but are not limited to, development milestones, regulatory approvals, product sales, and shareholder approval for proposed transactions. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following chart represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 5,326 $ 103 $ 2,081 (2) $ 1,150 $ 1,992 Operating lease obligations 658 74 129 94 361 Purchase obligations(3) 2,879 1,249 1,014 331 285 Total contractual obligations $ 8,863 $ 1,426 $ 3,224 $ 1,575 $ 2,638 (1) The long-term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005 due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the convertible notes and the inclusion of future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on the 2007 Notes, the 2009 Notes, the 2014 Notes, and the Century Notes at fixed rates of 6.5%, 4.00%, 4.85%, and 8.1%, respectively, through maturity in 2007, 2009, 2014, and 2097, respectively. (2) Holders of the convertible notes could have required us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates as early as March 1, 2006 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount (“accreted value”) through the purchase dates. However, the holders of substantially all of the convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on this date. Consequently, the amounts above reflect the convertible notes’ accreted value on March 1, 2007, the next put date. (See Note 4, “Financing arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes.) (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (1) our long-term supply agreement with BI Pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for ENBREL and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved; (2) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (3) capital expenditures for engineering and construction which primarily relate to the Colorado manufacturing projects, Thousand Oaks research and development expansion and site development, Rhode Island site development, and certain ongoing Puerto Rico manufacturing projects; and (4) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the 69 ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales, sales incentives and returns Sales of our products other than EPOGEN® (see “EPOGEN® revenue recognition” below) are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. This typically occurs at the time products are shipped to the customer, generally a wholesale distributor. In the United States, we utilize these wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. Products we sell outside the United States are principally distributed to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third-party data, and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns. Accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts, and other incentives (collectively “sales incentives”) are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales. Sales incentive accruals are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data, and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales incentives are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives are comprised of the following (amounts in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Rebates $ 1,344 $ 1,033 $ 520 Wholesaler chargebacks 1,559 1,069 553 Discounts and other incentives 891 490 286 Total sales incentives $ 3,794 $ 2,592 $ 1,359 Percent of gross product sales 24 % 20 % 15 % Rebates earned by healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals and pharmacies in the United States are the sales incentives that are most difficult to estimate. These rebates are performance-based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually-specified sales volumes and growth. As a result, the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. These rebates totaled $1,344 million in 2005, $1,033 million in 2004, and $520 million in 2003. We believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. For example, a 5% change in the revenue reduction 70 attributable to rebates recognized in 2005 would have had an approximate $65 million effect on our reported product sales in 2005. Wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in “sales incentives” that relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the list prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers. These chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $1,559 million in 2005, $1,069 million in 2004, and $553 million in 2003. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability. Amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. However, such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives (amounts in millions): Balance at Beginning of Period Amounts Charged Against Product Sales* Payments Balance at End of Period Year ended: December 31, 2005 $ 589 $ 3,794 $ 3,519 $ 864 December 31, 2004 $ 358 $ 2,592 $ 2,361 $ 589 * Includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates. Such amounts represented approximately 1% of incentive amounts charged against product sales for both 2005 and 2004. Accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales. Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate. Historically, sales returns have been insignificant, amounting to approximately 1% of gross product sales. EPOGEN® revenue recognition We have the exclusive right to sell Epoetin alfa for dialysis, certain diagnostics, and all non-human, non-research uses in the United States. We granted to Johnson & Johnson a license relating to Epoetin alfa for sales in the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. Pursuant to this license, Amgen and Johnson & Johnson are required to compensate each other for Epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party’s exclusive market, sometimes referred to as “spillover.” Accordingly, we do not recognize product sales we make into the exclusive market of Johnson & Johnson and do recognize the product sales made by Johnson & Johnson into our exclusive market. Sales in our exclusive market are derived from our sales to our customers, as adjusted for spillover. We are employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party’s spillover based on independent third-party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage. Data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques, and accordingly, the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover. We initially recognize spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage, utilizing historical third-party data and subsequently adjust such amounts based on revised third-party data as received. Differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based 71 on revised third-party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized EPOGEN® sales. However, such differences to date have not been material. Deferred income taxes Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital, and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact our future effective tax rate. The American Jobs Creation Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. One provision of the American Jobs Creation Act effectively reduced the tax rate on a qualifying repatriation of earnings by providing for an 85% dividend-received deduction. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced rate. The tax expense incurred on this repatriation was approximately $43 million. We intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were not repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, tax claims, and governmental investigations. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.” We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by the IRS and various state and foreign tax authorities. Significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions. While we believe our positions comply with applicable laws, we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters. While it is not possible to predict accurately or determine the eventual outcome of these matters, we do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our annual consolidated financial statements, although an adverse resolution in any quarterly reporting period of one or more of these items could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Valuation of acquired intangible assets We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in-process product candidates as well as goodwill arising in business combinations. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, an independent third-party valuation firm is engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: · determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in-process projects, · projecting regulatory approvals, 72 · estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects, · and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our investment portfolio and debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed our available-for-sale debt securities, comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities, are similar enough to aggregate for presentation purposes. Interest income earned on our fixed income investment portfolio is impacted by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates upon reinvestment of funds received on maturity or sale of securities at the then current market rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our 2007 Notes, 2009 Notes, 2014 Notes, Century Notes and convertible notes because they bear interest at fixed rates. However, in 2003 and 2004, we entered into interest rate swap agreements, which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges, to protect against possible increases in value of our non-convertible notes, which swapped fixed interest payments for variable interest payments over the lives of the respective notes. For the interest rate swaps, the tables present the notional amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity date. Variable rates relating to the interest rate swaps are the average estimated forward rates for the term of each contract. The notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract. The interest rate swaps related to the available-for-sale debt securities shown in the 2004 table were liquidated in 2005 when the underlying available-for-sale fixed income securities either matured or were sold.

On March 2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their March 1, 2005 Put Option, we repurchased $1.2 billion, or approximately 40%, of the outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for cash. Concurrently, we amended the terms of the convertible notes to add an additional put date in order to permit the remaining holders, at their option, to cause us to repurchase the remaining convertible notes on March 1, 2006 at the then-accreted value. However, the holders of substantially all of the convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on this date. Consequently, for the December 31, 2004 table the amounts above reflect the convertible notes’ accreted value repurchased on March 2, 2005 and the remaining notes accreted value on March 1, 2006 (the then next available put date) and for the December 31, 2005 table the remaining convertible notes’ accreted value on March 1, 2007, the next available put date. In the event the holders of the convertible notes convert their convertible notes, we generally are required to pay the accreted value in cash. (See Note 4, “Financing arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes.) We are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had equity forward contracts to hedge against changes in the fair market value of a portion of our equity investment portfolio. We did not have material equity price risk on the unhedged portion of our equity investment portfolio at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately the Euro, as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to hedge against the effects of such fluctuations. Both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates have been mitigated by the natural, opposite impact that the investments in foreign exchange rates have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our results of operations. As such, the impact to our results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated. 74",2023-12-30 18:05:04.631692
318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2007,"Item 7., “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for further information regarding our consolidated results of operations and financial position for periods reported therein and for known factors that will impact comparability of future results. (1) We began recording ENBREL sales subsequent to our acquisition of Immunex in July 2002. (2) Included in operating expenses are acquisition charges of $41 million, $12 million, $53 million, $70 million and $87 million, in 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Acquisition charges consist of the incremental compensation provided to certain employees under short-term retention plans, including non-cash compensation expense associated with stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition, non-cash expense related to valuing the inventory acquired at fair value and external, incremental consulting and systems integration costs directly associated with integrating the acquisition. (3) As part of the accounting for the acquisitions of Avidia and Abgenix in 2006, Tularik in 2004 and Immunex in 2002, we recorded charges to write-off acquired IPR&D of $130 million and $1,101 million in 2006, $554 million in 2004 and $2,992 million in 2002. The IPR&D charge represents an estimate of the fair value of the in-process R&D for projects and technologies that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. (4) In October 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Avidia for a net purchase price of approximately $275 million. In April 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abgenix for a purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion. In August 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Tularik for a purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. In July 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Immunex for a purchase price of approximately $17.8 billion. (5) In February 2006, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the “2011 Convertible Notes”) and $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the “2013 Convertible Notes”) in a private placement. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.125% and 0.375%, respectively. In connection with the issuance of these notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also, concurrent with the issuance of these notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The cost of the convertible note hedges, which aggregated approximately $1.5 billion, was recorded as a reduction of equity. Also, concurrent with the issuance of these notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. (6) In March 2002, we issued convertible notes with a face amount at maturity of $3.95 billion. Holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates, the earliest of which was March 1, 2005, at the accreted principal amount through the purchase dates. On March 2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their March 1, 2005 put option, we repurchased $1.2 billion, or approximately 40%, of the outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for cash. Accordingly, the convertible notes repurchased were classified as current liabilities at December 31, 2004. Holders of the remaining outstanding convertible notes may require us to purchase, generally for cash, all or a portion of the notes on various dates at a price equal to the accreted principal amount through the purchase date. The next available put date was March 1, 2006, however, the holders of substantially all of the then outstanding convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on this date. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2005, the convertible notes were classified as non-current liabilities. The next date that the holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of these notes is on March 1, 2007. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2006, the convertible notes were classified as current liabilities. (7) In November 2004, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due in 2009 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.85% senior notes due in 2014. (8) We have a share repurchase program through which we have repurchased $5.0 billion, $4.4 billion, $4.1 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion of Amgen common stock in 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward looking statements This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume,” “continue,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” We have based our forward looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (“EPS”), liquidity and capital resources and trends. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Overview The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to assist the reader in understanding the business of Amgen Inc., including its subsidiaries (referred to as “Amgen,” “we,” “our” and “us”). MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We are a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. As a science-based, patient-focused organization, we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat grievous illness. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products include Aranesp®, Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®, EPOGEN® and ENBREL. ENBREL is marketed under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth in the United States and Canada. (See “Item 1. Business — Principal Products” for additional information about our principal products, their approved indications and where they are marketed.) In October 2006, we launched Vectibix™, our first cancer therapeutic, after receiving FDA approval in late September. Product sales of Vectibix™ were not significant for 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, total revenues were $14,268 million and net income was $2,950 million, or $2.48 per share on a diluted basis. The results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the $130 million and $1.1 billion write-offs of acquired IPR&D costs associated with the Avidia and Abgenix acquisitions, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $6.3 billion, of which approximately $4.2 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the United States. Our total debt outstanding was $9.0 billion as of December 31, 2006. For both years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, product sales represented 97% of total revenues, which was mainly comprised of our principal products. Over the last several years, our product sales growth has been 61 Table of Contents primarily driven by sales of Aranesp®, Neulasta® and ENBREL, which have benefited primarily from share gains and/or segment growth. We expect these products to continue to drive year-over-year sales growth in the near term and that Vectibix™ will also contribute to this growth. However, we believe that maintaining or increasing share will be more of a challenge than in previous years as we experienced share loss with ENBREL in 2006 compared to 2005 and we operate in an increasingly competitive environment. For example, Roche is developing a peg-EPO product for the United States for which they have filed a BLA with the FDA and have announced plans to launch in the nephrology segment in 2007 despite our ongoing lawsuit and their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents (see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Roche Matters — Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., et al.”). (See “Item 1. Business — Competition” for further information on the impact of competition on our business.) In addition, as discussed below, we also anticipate increased competition internationally from biosimilar and other competing products. Going forward, we will focus on growing our segments, including increasing our penetration in the therapeutic areas in which our products are used, while also continuing to focus on maintaining or increasing share. Over the last few years, our principal products have attained significant sales levels and have experienced strong year-over-year sales growth. However, the rate of growth has declined in each of the past several years and, in the near term, we expect this trend will continue. Most patients receiving Aranesp® and Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® for approved indications are covered by both government and private payer healthcare programs. In the United States, approved dialysis providers are primarily reimbursed for EPOGEN® by the federal government through the ESRD Program of Medicare. The ESRD program reimburses 80% of allowed dialysis costs, with the remainder being paid by other sources including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance and, to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, ENBREL and Sensipar® also became eligible for coverage from the U.S. Government under Medicare Program Part D. Generally, in Europe and other countries outside the U.S., the government sponsored healthcare system is the primary payer of healthcare costs of patients. Governments may regulate access to, prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce healthcare expenditures. Therefore, sales of our principal products and sales growth are, and will be, affected by the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government and private insurance plans. While we believe that our product sales for 2006 and 2005 have not been nor, for 2007, are expected to be significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA enacted in 2005, additional provisions of the MMA and other regulations affecting reimbursement that have gone, or may go, into effect could affect our product sales and related sales growth in the future. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see “Item 1. Business — Reimbursement.” International product sales for both years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 represented 18% of total product sales and consisted principally of European sales. International product sales have grown significantly over the last several years driven by Aranesp® and Neulasta® reflecting continued penetration. However, we anticipate facing greater competition in Europe from the availability of biosimilar and other competing products. Although we cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU, we believe that the first biosimilar G-CSF product, which would compete with Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®, and that the first biosimilar erythropoietin products, which would compete with Aranesp®, may be approved in 2007 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. Based on an announcement by Shire, we expect that a competing erythropoietin product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in 2007. In addition, Roche is developing its peg-EPO product which, upon regulatory approval, we expect they will launch in the EU nephrology segment in 2007. We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar or other competing products would impact future Aranesp®, Neulasta® or NEUPOGEN® sales in the EU. (See “Item 1. Business — Competition” for further information regarding biosimilar products.) Our international product sales are impacted by foreign currency changes (see “Results of Operations” discussion below). International product sales growth during 2006 was unfavorably impacted by $13 million, while 2005 was favorably impacted by $46 million, from foreign currency exchange rate changes. However, both the 62 Table of Contents positive and negative impacts that movements in foreign exchange rates have on our international product sales are mitigated, in part, by the natural, opposite impact these exchange rate movements have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our net income. As such, the impact to our net results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, operating income was as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Operating Income $ 3,840 (21)% $ 4,848 Operating income as a percentage of product sales was 28% for 2006 and 40% for 2005. The decline in operating income as a percentage of product sales for the year ended 2006 compared to the year ended 2005 primarily reflects the impact of the acquired IPR&D charges related to the Abgenix and Avidia acquisitions in 2006, the increase in R&D expenses to expand our R&D activities as discussed below, higher selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses to support our growing organization and the expensing of stock options, which commenced January 1, 2006. We focus our R&D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness. (See “Item 1. Business — Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates” for further information on our R&D vision and product pipeline.) We have substantially expanded our R&D capabilities and plan to continue increasing our investments to expand these capabilities to manage and execute increasingly larger and more complex clinical trials and to build the capacity to advance more compounds into and through the clinic. We began nine “mega-site” trials (involving 200 or more sites) in 2006 to support denosumab and our other late-stage programs. For 2007, we expect R&D expense to increase, although not to the extent experienced in 2006, due to the continuance of the “mega-site” trials previously started, including the nine started in 2006, beginning additional studies in 2007 in support of our late-stage programs, including studies for panitumumab and motesanib diphosphate, and advancing a number of additional molecules into phase 2. The nine “mega-site” trials, which we began in 2006, will continue to require significant time, resources and expense to execute. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.”) To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to continue the growth of our development organization and associated R&D support organizations, implement new management structures and approaches and continue to partner with third-party contract clinical trial providers. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we partnered with third-party contract clinical trial providers to open clinical sites and are enrolling patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, Mexico and some South American countries. In 2007, we plan to expand into Southeast Asia and India. On April 1, 2006, we paid shareholders of Abgenix $22.50 in cash per common share for a total value of approximately $2.1 billion to acquire all of the outstanding shares and assumed Abgenix’s outstanding debt with a fair value of approximately $686 million. Abgenix was a company with expertise in the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies and was our co-development partner for Vectibix™. The results of Abgenix’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing April 1, 2006. On October 24, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Avidia. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid in cash approximately $275 million, net of cash acquired and our existing equity stake in Avidia, and may be subject to pay additional amounts upon the achievement of certain future events. Avidia focused on the discovery and development of a new class of human therapeutic known as Avimer™ proteins. The transaction provides Amgen with Avidia's lead product candidate, an inhibitor of interleukin 6 (IL-6) for the treatment of inflammation and autoimmune diseases, which is in phase 1 clinical trials. The results of Avidia’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing October 25, 2006. In December 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Cytokinetics Incorporated (“Cytokinetics”) to discover, develop and commercialize novel small-molecule therapeutics that activate cardiac 63 Table of Contents muscle contractility for potential application in the treatment of heart failure. In addition, we obtained an option to participate in future developments and commercialization of Cytokinetics’ lead drug candidate arising from this program, CK-1827452, which recently entered two phase 1 clinical trials. The collaboration is worldwide, excluding Japan. There are many economic and industry-wide factors that affect our business generally and uniquely, including, among others, those relating to increased complexity and cost of R&D due, in part, to greater scrutiny of clinical trials with respect to safety which may lead to fewer treatments being approved by the FDA; increasingly intense competition for marketed products and product candidates; broad reimbursement changes; complex and expanding regulatory requirements; and intellectual property protection. (See “Item 1. Business” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information on these economic and industry-wide factors and their impact and potential impact on our business.) In addition to these economic and industry-wide factors, we, as a company, face certain additional challenges and have a number of opportunities as well. Our principal products have established leadership positions attaining significant sales levels over the last few years and have experienced strong year-over-year sales growth. However, the rate of growth has declined in each of the past several years and, in the near term, we expect this trend to continue. We believe that future sales growth for certain of our principal products should benefit from segment growth, including increased penetration through new areas of treatment and/or greater awareness. At the same time in 2007, however, they will be subject to increasing competition, which includes the expected introduction of biosimilars in Europe. In addition, future sales growth may be impacted by healthcare provider prescribing behavior or use of our products, or regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement of our products. Also, with the promise of our growing pipeline comes the challenge of delivering on the pipeline, including executing on large and complex clinical trials. To execute on these clinical trial programs we will need to increase the growth of our R&D organization, open clinical sites and enroll patients in new geographic locations and continue reliance on third-party contractors. Further, the growth of our clinical and commercial operations will require increased manufacturing capacity, which is a lengthy and costly process. In the near term, our 2007 objectives to assist in meeting these challenges and to be successful in taking advantage of our opportunities are to: i) balance short term financial performance with increased R&D investment to allow us to execute key clinical trials for our late-stage product candidates and advance a number of additional molecules further along the development process; ii) grow our markets and hold or increase share; iii) vigorously defend our intellectual property and increase our leadership in anemia management; and iv) proactively expand production capacity as we grow. Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Aranesp® $ 4,121 26% $ 3,273 32% $ 2,473 Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® 3,923 12% 3,504 20% 2,915 EPOGEN® 2,511 2% 2,455 (6)% 2,601 ENBREL 2,879 12% 2,573 35% 1,900 Sensipar® 321 104% 157 324% 37 Vectibix™ 39 n/a — n/a — Other 64 7% 60 18% 51 Total product sales $ 13,858 15% $ 12,022 20% $ 9,977 Total U.S. $ 11,397 15% $ 9,892 19% $ 8,279 Total International 2,461 16% 2,130 25% 1,698 Total product sales $ 13,858 15% $ 12,022 20% $ 9,977 64 Table of Contents Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, regulatory developments, clinical trial outcomes, clinical practice, pricing strategies, wholesaler and end-user inventory management practices, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, new product launches and indications, competitive products, product supply and acquisitions. (See “Item 1. Business — Principal Products” for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) Sales growth in 2006 and 2005 was principally driven by demand for Aranesp®, Neulasta® and ENBREL, which benefited from share gains and/or market growth. International product sales growth in 2005 benefited by $46 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. We expect Aranesp®, Neulasta® and ENBREL to continue to drive year-over-year sales growth in 2007 and that Vectibix™ will also contribute to that growth. However, we expect that maintaining or increasing share will be more of a challenge than in previous years as we experienced share loss with ENBREL in 2006 compared to 2005 and we operate in an increasingly competitive environment. Going forward, we will focus on growing our segments, including increasing our penetration in the therapeutic areas in which our products are used, while also continuing to focus on maintaining or increasing share. We believe that our product sales for 2005 and 2006 were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA implemented in 2005. We believe this was, in part, due to the effects of CMS’ 2005 and 2006 oncology demonstration projects on sales of our products used in supportive cancer care, especially Aranesp®. However, we believe it is unlikely that CMS will implement an oncology demonstration project for 2007. Furthermore, we believe that our sales for 2005 and 2006 were not significantly impacted, in part, due to increased reimbursement rates to physicians from CMS for services associated with drug administration. The 2006 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule reduced payments for physician services in 2006 by approximately 4.4% on average, although subsequent legislation eliminated this reduction for 2006. The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule for 2007 would have reduced payments for physician services in 2007 by approximately 5.0% on average, however, as in 2006, new legislation eliminated the reduction in payments for 2007. Because we cannot accurately predict the impact of any such changes on how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products, we cannot estimate the full impact of the MMA on our business, although we believe that it is not likely to be significant to our business in 2007. However, additional provisions of the MMA and other regulations affecting reimbursement that have gone or may go into effect could affect our product sales and related sales growth in the future. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see “Item 1. Business — Reimbursement.” Aranesp® For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Aranesp® — U.S. $ 2,790 33 % $ 2,104 37 % $ 1,533 Aranesp® — International 1,331 14 % 1,169 24 % 940 Total Aranesp® $ 4,121 26 % $ 3,273 32 % $ 2,473 The increase in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily driven by demand reflecting segment growth and share gains. The growth in U.S. Aranesp® sales also reflects increased Aranesp® usage in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics from continued conversion from EPOGEN®, which we believe stabilized in mid-2006. The increase in international Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was also principally driven by demand. The increase in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily driven by market growth and share gains. Sales growth for 2005 was slightly impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. Although ASPs for U.S. Aranesp® trended downward during 2005, they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005. In 2005, 65 Table of Contents Aranesp® usage in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics increased, reflecting a conversion from EPOGEN®. International Aranesp® sales growth for 2005 was principally driven by demand, benefiting only slightly, $20 million, from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For 2007, we believe that Aranesp® sales growth will be driven primarily by segment growth. Further, sales of Aranesp® have benefited, and may continue to benefit, by its use in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of EPOGEN®, however, we believe this conversion stabilized as of mid-2006. In addition, we believe future worldwide Aranesp® sales growth may also be dependent, in part, on such factors as reimbursement by third-party payers (including governments and private insurance plans); cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; government programs; adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others which may expand safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; penetration of existing and new segments, including potential new indications; patient population growth; the effects of pricing strategies; an increasingly competitive environment of products or therapies, which in 2007 in the United States could potentially include competition in the nephrology segment from Roche’s peg-EPO, which Roche has indicated they intend to bring to the U.S. market in 2007 despite our ongoing lawsuit and their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents (see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Roche Matters — Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., et al.”) and in the EU in 2007 could potentially include biosimilars, Shire’s erythropoietin product, Roche’s peg-EPO product and other competing products (see “Item 1. Business — Competition” for further information on the impact of competition on our business); our ability to differentiate Aranesp® from current and potential future competition; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”). Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Neulasta® — U.S. $ 2,217 17 % $ 1,900 29 % $ 1,476 NEUPOGEN® — U.S. 830 3 % 805 3 % 778 U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total 3,047 13 % 2,705 20 % 2,254 Neulasta® — International 493 27 % 388 47 % 264 NEUPOGEN® — International 383 (7)% 411 4 % 397 International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total 876 10 % 799 21 % 661 Total Worldwide Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® $ 3,923 12 % $ 3,504 20 % $ 2,915 The increase in U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta®, reflecting segment growth. In addition, the increase in demand for Neulasta® for the year ended December 31, 2006 also includes the impact of a 2 percent U.S. price increase in April 2006. U.S. demand for Neulasta® continued to benefit from a product label extension based on clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle utilization in moderate-high risk chemotherapy regimens. The increase in international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta®. The increase in U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta®, which benefited from guidelines recommending earlier use. U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales, Neulasta® in particular, also benefited from a label extension based on clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use in moderate risk chemotherapy regimens. In addition, U.S. sales growth was 66 Table of Contents slightly impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. Although ASPs for U.S. Neulasta® trended downward during 2005, they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2005, was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta®. International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for 2005 also benefited by $18 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. We believe that 2007 sales growth for Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® will depend on further segment penetration of Neulasta® in the moderate-risk population that would benefit from its earlier use and by focusing on the value of its treatment in first and subsequent chemotherapy cycles. In addition, future worldwide Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as reimbursement by third-party payers (including governments and private insurance plans); cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others which may expand safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; government programs (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”); penetration of existing segments; patient population growth; the effects of pricing strategies; competitive products or therapies, including biosimilar products that may be approved in 2007 in the EU and be available shortly thereafter; changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the development of new treatments for cancer. Future chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®, however, other future chemotherapy treatments that are more myelosuppressive, such as dose dense chemotherapy, could require more Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®. NEUPOGEN® competes with Neulasta® in the United States and Europe. U.S. and International NEUPOGEN® sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta®. However, we believe that most of the conversion in the United States and in Europe has occurred. EPOGEN® For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 EPOGEN® — U.S. $ 2,511 2% $ 2,455 (6)% $ 2,601 Reported EPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased modestly primarily due to the increased demand in the free-standing dialysis centers partially offset by the increased use of Aranesp® in the hospital setting. We believe that conversion to Aranesp® in the hospital setting stabilized in mid-2006. We believe demand for EPOGEN® in the free-standing dialysis centers, which account for the majority of the EPOGEN® sales, remained consistent with patient population growth at approximately 3 to 4 percent. EPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased primarily due to lower demand, unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventory levels and an unfavorable revised estimate of dialysis demand, primarily spillover, for prior quarters. Demand for 2005 was affected by conversion to Aranesp® in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics, which represented approximately 10% of the EPOGEN® business, and reflected higher sales incentives. Demand for EPOGEN® in the free-standing dialysis clinics remained consistent with patient population growth at approximately 3 to 4 percent. Spillover is a result of our contractual relationship with Johnson & Johnson (see “Summary of Critical Accounting Policies — EPOGEN® revenue recognition” below and Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies — Product sales” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). EPOGEN® sales in 2007 may be negatively impacted by certain external developments such as the possibility of competition from Roche’s peg-EPO, which Roche has indicated they intend to bring to the U.S. market in 2007 despite our ongoing lawsuit and their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents (see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Roche Matters — Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., et al.”) (see “Item 1. Business — Competition” for further information on the impact of competition on our business) as well as adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others which may expand safety labeling 67 Table of Contents and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices. Sales for EPOGEN® in 2007 could, however, be favorably impacted to a certain degree by underlying demand in the free-standing dialysis centers, which we believe will remain consistent with the annual patient population growth of 3 to 4 percent, and the lessened impact of conversion to Aranesp® in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics, which we believe stabilized in mid-2006. Dialysis patients receiving treatment for anemia associated with end stage renal disease with EPOGEN® are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government. Therefore, going forward, we believe EPOGEN® sales growth will further depend on changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government. We believe EPOGEN® sales growth will also be dependent, in part, on future governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products, cost containment pressures from the federal government on healthcare providers and the effects of pricing strategies (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”). ENBREL For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 ENBREL — U.S. $ 2,736 11 % $ 2,470 35 % $ 1,827 ENBREL — International 143 39 % 103 41 % 73 Total ENBREL $ 2,879 12 % $ 2,573 35 % $ 1,900 ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven by increased demand in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. The increase in demand for the year ended December 31, 2006 also includes the impact of a 4.9 percent U.S. price increase that went into effect May 1, 2006. While ENBREL continued to maintain a leading position in both rheumatology and dermatology, we have experienced moderate share loss in both segments in 2006 compared to 2005. ENBREL sales growth was also affected in 2006 by slowing segment growth in dermatology and by increased competitive activities in both segments. ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2005 was driven by demand, reflecting strong growth in both rheumatology and dermatology. ENBREL sales growth benefited from its competitive profile and significant growth of biologics in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. Sales growth for ENBREL in 2007 will depend on growing both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. In addition, future ENBREL sales growth will be dependent on such factors as the effects of competing products or therapies and, in part, our ability to differentiate ENBREL based on safety and efficacy; segment growth; the availability, extent and access to reimbursement by government and third-party payers; cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others which may expand safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; and the effects of pricing strategies (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.”). 68 Table of Contents Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes selected operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Product sales $ 13,858 15% $ 12,022 20% $ 9,977 Operating expenses: Cost of sales (excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets) $ 2,095 1% $ 2,082 20% $ 1,731 % of product sales 15% 17% 17% Research and development $ 3,366 45% $ 2,314 14% $ 2,028 % of product sales 24% 19% 20% Selling, general and administrative $ 3,366 21% $ 2,790 9% $ 2,556 % of product sales 24% 23% 26% Write-off of acquired in-process research and development $ 1,231 $ — $ 554 Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 370 $ 347 $ 333 Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets (see “Consolidated Statements of Operations”), increased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Cost of sales grew much slower than revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 due primarily to lower royalties as well as a more favorable product mix and cost efficiencies at our factories. Royalty expenses were lower due to the expiration of certain contractual royalty obligations on Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® sales and the acquisition of certain royalty rights on sales of ENBREL and EU Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® sales. Cost of sales increased 20% for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to higher sales volumes. Costs of sales for 2005 were also impacted by the $47 million write-off of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that was determined to be unusable due to a change in manufacturing strategy. Research and development R&D expenses are primarily comprised of costs and expenses for salaries and benefits associated with R&D personnel, overhead and occupancy, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing, including contract services and other outside costs, process development, quality assurance, information systems and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses also include such costs related to activities performed on behalf of corporate partners. R&D expenses increased 45% for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to higher staff levels and increased funding necessary to support clinical trials for our late-stage programs, which include denosomab, our late-stage investigational product for osteoporosis and metastatic bone cancer, and the continued expansion of our research and pre-clinical organization to build the capacity to advance more compounds into and through the clinic. We began nine “mega-site” trials (involving 200 or more sites) in 2006 to support denosumab and our other late-stage programs. In addition, R&D for the year ended December 31, 2006, includes approximately $104 million in stock option expense, which was not reflected in our Consolidated Results of Operations prior to January 1, 2006 (see “Recent accounting pronouncements” below) and approximately $48 million in non-cash amortization expense for the intangible asset, XenoMouse® technology, acquired in the Abgenix acquisition. In 2006, staff-related costs, including stock option compensation, and clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately $467 million and $355 million, respectively. In 2005, R&D expenses increased 14% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher staff-related costs, which included the full year integration of the Tularik operations and the buildup of our R&D organization to support the growth in our pipeline. The 2005 growth also reflected higher costs relating to key clinical trials and clinical manufacturing, including the continued ramp up of large-scale phase 3 trials for denosumab, Amgen’s investigational therapy for bone loss. In 2005, staff-related costs and clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs increased approximately $171 million and $118 million, respectively. 69 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative SG&A expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; outside marketing expenses; overhead and occupancy costs; other legal costs; and other general and administrative costs. SG&A increased 21% for the year ended December 31, 2006, reflecting higher staff levels and additional infrastructure costs to support the growing organization, in particular our Global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system, higher Wyeth profit share expenses related to ENBREL sales and higher legal costs associated with ongoing litigation. In addition, SG&A costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 included approximately $120 million in stock option expense, which was not reflected in our Consolidated Results of Operations prior to January 1, 2006 (see “Recent accounting pronouncements” below). In 2006, staff-related costs, including stock option compensation, and additional infrastructure costs increased over 2005 by $323 million and $59 million, respectively. In addition, we incurred $38 million for the above-noted higher outside legal costs and $198 million in increased outside marketing expenses in support of our principal products, including the Wyeth profit share related to ENBREL in 2006 as compared to 2005. Outside marketing expenses include the Wyeth profit share related to ENBREL, which has increased due to ENBREL sales growth. In 2005, SG&A increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to higher outside marketing expenses in support of our principal products. Outside marketing expenses include the Wyeth profit share related to ENBREL, which has increased due to ENBREL sales growth. During 2005, outside marketing expenses and staff-related costs increased approximately $241 million and $42 million, respectively. Write-off of acquired in-process research and development The fair value of acquired IPR&D projects and technologies which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition are immediately expensed. In 2006, we incurred charges of $1,101 million and $130 million, associated with writing off the fair value of IPR&D acquired in the Abgenix and Avidia acquisitions, respectively (see Note 7, “Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2004, we incurred a charge of $554 million, associated with writing off the fair value of IPR&D acquired in the Tularik acquisition (see Note 7, “Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Amortization of acquired intangible assets Amortization of acquired intangible assets relates to the acquired products technology rights acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition. In 2006, this amortization also included $49 million related to the impairment of a non-ENBREL related intangible asset previously acquired in the Immunex acquisition. Other items, net In 2005, other items, net consisted of a $49 million charge, net of amounts previously accrued, for settling certain legal matters associated with a patent legal proceeding. (See Note 12, “Other” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 26.6%, 24.5% and 30.4% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2006 increased primarily due to the write-off of acquired IPR&D costs in connection with the acquisitions of Abgenix and Avidia, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The increase in the rate was partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States and favorable audit settlements. In addition, the 2005 tax rate was negatively impacted by the tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. As permitted in Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes — Special Areas,” we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. 70 Table of Contents The 2005 effective tax rate was lower than the 2004 effective tax rate due to the favorable resolution of prior year foreign tax credit claims and R&D tax credits with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and the absence of the write-off of non-deductible IPR&D costs in connection with the acquisition of Tularik in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by the tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million of foreign earnings, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate. The tax expense incurred on the repatriation was approximately $43 million. (See Note 4, “Income taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Recent accounting pronouncements On January 1, 2006 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to account for our stock options using a fair-value-based method as described in such statement and recognize the resulting compensation expense in our financial statements. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our employee stock options using the intrinsic value method under APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” which generally did not result in any employee stock option expense. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified-prospective-transition method. Under this transition method, compensation expense recognized subsequent to adoption includes (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the values estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair values estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The modified-prospective-transition method did not require recognition of related compensation expense in our financial statements for prior periods. Comparability, therefore, of the current period financial statements to prior periods has been and will be impacted. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) had a material impact on our results of operations for 2006. The annual stock option expense is dependent on a number of factors including the number of stock options granted, our common stock price and related expected volatility and other inputs utilized in estimating the fair value of the stock options at the time of grant. As a result of recognizing compensation expense for stock options pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), our income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $233 million lower, and our net income was $152 million lower than if we had continued to account for stock options under APB No. 25. In addition, both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $0.14 lower, than if we had continued to account for stock options under APB No. 25. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing rules for recognition, measurement, classification and disclosure in our financial statements of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Based on our evaluations, we currently believe that the only impact to us of adopting this new standard is to reclassify certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions from current to non-current liabilities in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. We adopted this new standard effective January 1, 2007. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data (amounts in millions): December 31, 2006 2005 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 6,277 $ 5,255 Total assets 33,788 29,297 Current debt 1,878 — Non-current debt 7,134 3,957 Stockholders' equity 18,964 20,451 71 Table of Contents We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, as well as to support our stock repurchase programs and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities. However, in order to provide for greater financial flexibility and liquidity, we are currently reviewing additional borrowing opportunities. We would expect to use any proceeds raised by such borrowing primarily for purchases of shares under our stock repurchase program and for general corporate purposes, including satisfying our obligation to repay borrowings under our 2032 Modified Convertible Notes if the note holders elect to put the notes to us for payment on March 1, 2007, capital expenditures and other working capital needs. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2006, approximately $4.2 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the United States. If these funds are repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, substantial additional taxes on certain of these amounts would be required to be paid. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million of foreign earnings, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate under the American Jobs Act. The repatriation of these funds resulted in an increase in our 2005 tax provision of $43 million. The primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return, consistent with these two objectives. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. Financing arrangements In February 2006, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the “2011 Convertible Notes”) and $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the “2013 Convertible Notes”) in a private placement. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.125% and 0.375%, respectively. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may be convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 12.5247 shares and 12.5814 shares, respectively, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $79.84 and $79.48 per share, respectively). The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may only be converted 1) during any calendar quarter beginning after June 30, 2006 if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the respective conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous quarter, 2) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur or 3) one month prior to the respective maturity date. Upon conversion, a holder would receive 1) cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value, as defined, and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, shares of our common stock, cash or a combination of common stock and cash, at our option (the “excess conversion value”). In addition, upon a change in control, as defined, the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes for 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rate our outstanding convertible notes A2 and A+, respectively. In connection with the issuance of these convertible notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash from the counterparties to the transactions equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes upon conversion. These transactions will terminate the earlier of the maturity dates of the related notes or the first day none of the related notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. The cost of the convertible note hedges, which aggregated approximately $1.5 billion, was recorded as a reduction of equity. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 and 2013 Convertible Notes, the repurchase of common stock and the purchase of the convertible note hedges was $439 million. 72 Table of Contents Also concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $107.90 per share in a private placement. Pursuant to these transactions, warrants for approximately 31.3 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2011 and warrants for approximately 31.5 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2013 (the “settlement dates”). If the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be settled, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. As of December 31, 2006 we had zero coupon convertible notes due in 2032 with an accreted value of $1.8 billion outstanding and having an aggregate face amount of $2.36 billion and yield to maturity of 1.125%. The holders of these convertible notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their convertible notes on specified dates (the “Put Option”), at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount through the purchase date. The next available Put Option date is on March 1, 2007. Accordingly, the convertible notes were classified as current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rate our outstanding convertible notes A2 and A+, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 we had $2.0 billion of long-term notes outstanding. These long-term notes consisted of 1) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% and mature in 2009 and 2) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.85% and mature in 2014. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rate our outstanding long-term senior notes A2 and A+, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, we had $235 million of additional debt securities outstanding. These debt securities consisted of 1) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.5% and mature in 2007 under a $500 million debt shelf registration statement (the “$500 Million Shelf”), 2) $100 million of long-term debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.1% and mature in 2097 and 3) $35 million in long-term notes due in 2013 with an effective rate of 5.35% assumed in the Abgenix acquisition. Our outstanding long-term debt is rated A2 by Moody’s and A+ by Standard & Poor’s. Under the $500 Million Shelf, all of the remaining $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. We have a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support, which matures in November 2010. Additionally, we have a commercial paper program, which provides for unsecured, short-term borrowings of up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility or commercial paper program as of December 31, 2006. We have a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement (the “$1 Billion Shelf”) which allows us to issue debt securities, common stock and associated preferred share purchase rights, preferred stock, warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, securities purchase contracts, securities purchase units and depositary shares. The $1 Billion Shelf was established to provide for further financial flexibility and the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2006, no securities had been issued under the $1 Billion Shelf. To protect against the potential increase in the fair value of our non-convertible, fixed interest rate notes due to a decline in interest rates, we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert the payment of our fixed rate notes to LIBOR-based variable interest payments over the life of the respective notes. These interest rate swap agreements qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, aggregate face amount of our outstanding non-convertible, fixed interest rate debt was covered by these interest rate swap agreements. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and as of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. 73 Table of Contents Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (amounts in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,389 $ 4,911 $ 3,697 Net cash used in investing activities (5,131 ) (59 ) (1,399 ) Net cash used in financing activities (815 ) (4,538 ) (1,609 ) Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by the growth in product sales and the timing of payments in the ordinary course of business (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). The increase in cash provided by operations for 2005 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by growth in product sales and timing differences of cash payments relating to our tax and other accrued liabilities (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). Investing On October 24, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Avidia and paid $275 million in cash, net of cash acquired and our existing equity stake in Avidia. In addition, we may be subject to pay additional amounts upon the achievement of certain future events. On April, 1, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Abgenix and paid $2.1 billion in cash to the shareholders of Abgenix to acquire all outstanding shares. In addition, we acquired $252 million in cash, and subsequent to the completion of the acquisition, we paid off $653 million of debt assumed in this transaction. Capital expenditures totaled $1.2 billion in 2006 compared with $867 million in 2005 and $1.3 billion in 2004. Capital expenditures in 2006 were primarily associated with ongoing manufacturing capacity and site expansions in Ireland, Puerto Rico and other locations and costs associated with implementing our ERP system. Capital expenditures in 2005 primarily related to the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion which included a new manufacturing plant for the commercial production of Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® approved by the FDA in September 2005, Thousand Oaks site expansion, Colorado manufacturing expansion and site development to support the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, also approved by the FDA in September 2005. Capital expenditures in 2004 primarily related to the Thousand Oaks site expansion, the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island and the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion. We currently estimate 2007 spending on capital projects and equipment to be in the range of $1.9 to $2.2 billion as we continue to increase our manufacturing and R&D operations globally and proceed with the implementation of our ERP system. The most significant of these expenditures are expected to be incurred with the further expansion of the Puerto Rico bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish facilities, the start of construction of a new bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish facility and other site infrastructure support in Ireland and the expansion of R&D operations in the United States. For additional information on our planned capital projects, see “Item 1. Business — Manufacturing and Raw Materials.” Financing In December 2006, the Board authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.5 billion available for stock repurchases under this and the previously authorized stock repurchase programs. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. 74 Table of Contents Repurchases under our stock repurchase program reflect, in part, our confidence in the long-term value of Amgen common stock. Additionally, we believe that it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders. A summary of our repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars First quarter 46.6 $ 3,374 26.8 $ 1,675 10.1 $ 650 Second quarter 13.0 876 12.1 750 17.4 1,000 Third quarter 7.3 505 9.5 769 24.0 1,398 Fourth quarter 3.3 245 14.8 1,236 17.6 1,024 Total 70.2 $ 5,000 63.2 $ 4,430 69.1 $ 4,072 (See “Item 5(c). Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information regarding our stock repurchase programs.) In February 2006, we issued $5.0 billion convertible notes, of which $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.125% and are due in 2011 and $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.375% and are due in 2013. In connection with the issuance of these convertible notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also concurrent with the issuance of these convertible notes, we purchased convertible note hedges at a cost of approximately $1.5 billion. The net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2011 and 2013 Convertible Notes, the repurchase of common stock and the purchase of the convertible note hedges was $439 million. Also concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes, we sold 62.8 million warrants to acquire shares of our common stock for proceeds of $774 million, 31.3 million of which may be settled in May 2011 and 31.5 million of which may be settled in May 2013. For further information on these transactions, see “Financing arrangements” above. On March 2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the zero coupon convertible notes due in 2032 exercising their March 1, 2005 Put Option, we repurchased $1.59 billion aggregate principal amount or approximately 40% of the then outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1,175 million in cash. We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan. Employee stock option exercises and proceeds from the sale of stock by us pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans provided $528 million, $1.1 billion and $453 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. In November 2004, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due 2009 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.85% senior notes due 2014. The net proceeds totaled $1,989 million and were intended for purchases of stock under the stock repurchase program then in affect and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Accordingly, the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties, all of which are contingent upon certain future events. Such events could include, but are not limited to, development 75 Table of Contents milestones, regulatory approvals and product sales. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following chart represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006, aggregated by type (amounts in millions): Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total Less than1 year 1-3years 4-5years More than5 years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 10,328 $ 1,997 (2) $ 1,215 $ 2,635 $ 4,481 Operating lease obligations 1,230 96 197 185 752 Purchase obligations(3) 3,724 1,911 1,209 435 169 Total contractual obligations $ 15,282 $ 4,004 $ 2,621 $ 3,255 $ 5,402 (1) The long-term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006 due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the 2032 Convertible Notes and 2032 Modified Convertible Notes and the inclusion of future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on the 2007 Notes, the 2009 Notes, the 2011 Convertible Notes, the 2013 Convertible Notes, the 2014 Notes and the Century Notes at fixed rates of 6.5%, 4.00%, 0.125%, 0.375%, 4.85% and 8.1%, respectively, through maturity in 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2097, respectively. (2) Holders of the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates the next of which is March 1, 2007 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount (“accreted value”) through the purchase dates. Consequently, the amounts above reflect the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes accreted value on March 1, 2007, the next put date. (See Note 5, “Financing arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes.) (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (1) our long-term supply agreement with BI Pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for ENBREL and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved; (2) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (3) capital expenditures for further expansion of the Puerto Rico bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish facilities, the start of construction of a new bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish facility and other site infrastructure support in Ireland, the expansion of R&D operations in the United States; and (4) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 76 Table of Contents Product sales, sales incentives and returns Sales of our products are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other incentives (collectively “sales incentives”) and returns. For additional discussion regarding revenue recognition, see “EPOGEN® revenue recognition” below. In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell outside the United States are principally distributed to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third-party data and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns. Accruals for sales incentives are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales. Sales incentive accruals are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales incentives are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives are comprised of the following (amounts in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Rebates $ 2,164 $ 1,344 $ 1,033 Wholesaler chargebacks 1,636 1,559 1,069 Discounts and other incentives 653 891 490 Total sales incentives $ 4,453 $ 3,794 $ 2,592 Percent of gross product sales 24% 24% 20% Rebates earned by healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals and pharmacies in the United States are the sales incentives that are most difficult to estimate. These rebates are performance-based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually-specified sales volumes and growth. As a result, the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. These rebates totaled $2,164 million in 2006, $1,344 million in 2005 and $1,033 million in 2004. We believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on our recent experience, changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than 1.5% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for such periods. These changes in annual estimates substantially relate to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period. A 1.5% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2006 would have had an impact of approximately $32 million on our 2006 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in “sales incentives” that relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the list prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers. These chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $1,636 million in 2006, $1,559 million in 2005 and $1,069 million in 2004. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability. 77 Table of Contents Amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. However, such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives (amounts in millions): Balance atBeginning ofPeriod Amounts ChargedAgainst ProductSales* Payments Balance atEnd ofPeriod Year ended: December 31, 2006 $ 864 $ 4,453 $ 4,238 $ 1,079 December 31, 2005 $ 589 $ 3,794 $ 3,519 $ 864 * Includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates. Such amounts represented approximately 1% of incentive amounts charged against product sales for both 2006 and 2005. Accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales. Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate. Historically, sales returns have been insignificant, amounting to approximately 1% of gross product sales. EPOGEN® revenue recognition We have the exclusive right to sell Epoetin alfa for dialysis, certain diagnostics and all non-human, non-research uses in the United States. We sell Epoetin alfa under the brand name EPOGEN®. We granted to Johnson & Johnson a license relating to Epoetin alfa for sales in the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. This license agreement, which is perpetual, may be terminated for various reasons, including upon mutual agreement of the parties or default. The parties are required to compensate each other for Epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party’s exclusive market, sometimes referred to as “spillover.” Accordingly, we do not recognize product sales we make into the exclusive market of Johnson & Johnson and do recognize the product sales made by Johnson & Johnson into our exclusive market. The amount of EPOGEN® product sales we recognize each period consists of: (i) the amount of EPOGEN® we ship to our customers who are wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products and (ii) adjustments for spillover, as described below. Sales to our customers are evidenced by binding written agreements and purchase orders, and accordingly, the amounts are fixed and determinable. The calculated spillover amount has no impact on the amounts owed to us by our customers. We are employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party’s spillover based on independent third-party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage. Data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques, and accordingly, the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover. We initially recognize spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage, utilizing historical third-party data and subsequently adjust such amounts based on revised third-party data as received. Differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based on revised third-party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized EPOGEN® sales. However, such differences to date have not been material. Deferred income taxes Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact our future effective tax rate. 78 Table of Contents The American Jobs Creation Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. One provision of the American Jobs Creation Act effectively reduced the tax rate on a qualifying repatriation of earnings by providing for an 85% dividend-received deduction. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced rate. The tax expense incurred on this repatriation was approximately $43 million. We intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were not repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, tax claims and governmental investigations. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.” We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by the IRS and various state and foreign tax authorities. Significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions. While we believe our positions comply with applicable laws, we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items, we do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, although an adverse resolution in any quarterly or annual reporting period of one or more of these items could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations for that period. Valuation of acquired intangible assets We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in-process product candidates as well as goodwill arising in business combinations. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, an independent third-party valuation firm is engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: • determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in-process projects, • projecting regulatory approvals, • estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects and • developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. 79 Table of Contents Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our investment portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities, comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities, had a fair value of $6.1 billion and $5.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005. The fair values of these securities and the income they generate is impacted by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. A hypothetical change in interest rates of 10% relative to interest rates at December 31, 2006 and 2005 would not have a material effect on the fair values of these securities or our cash flows or income. On December 31, 2006, we had outstanding debt with a fair value of $8.9 billion (including debt with a fair value $6.7 billion, which may be converted into our common stock in certain circumstances). On December 31, 2005, we had outstanding debt with a fair value of $4.0 billion (including debt with a fair value of $1.8 billion, which may be converted into our common stock). Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our outstanding debt because they bear interest at fixed rates. However, changes in interest rates would affect their fair values. To protect against possible increases in the fair value of our non-convertible debt, we entered into interest rate swap agreements, which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. These agreements swapped the receipt of fixed interest payments for LIBOR-based variable interest payments over the lives of the respective notes. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2006 and 2005 would not have a material impact on the fair values of our outstanding debt and would not have a material impact on the fair values, cash flows or income with respect to the interest rate swap agreements. Market price sensitive instruments As noted above, a portion of our outstanding debt may be converted into our common stock. Accordingly, the price of our common stock may affect the fair value of our convertible debt. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the price of Amgen stock from the price at December 31, 2006 and 2005 would have reduced the fair value of our then outstanding convertible debt by approximately $274 million and $71 million, respectively. On December 31, 2006 and 2005, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Also, on December 31, 2005, we had equity forward contracts to hedge against changes in the fair market value of a portion of our equity investment portfolio. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio and equity forward contracts on December 31, 2006 and 2005 was not material. Foreign currency sensitive instruments Our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately the Euro, as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets. Both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural, opposite impact that foreign exchange rates have on our international operating expenses. To further reduce our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts. On December 31, 2006, we had outstanding forward exchange and options contracts with notional amounts of $1,576 million and $902 million, respectively, that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. These contracts had net unrealized losses totaling $15 million on December 31, 2006. Also on December 31, 2006, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $326 million that hedge fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2006. With regard to these contracts, a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on December 31, 2006 would result in a reduction in fair value, cash flows and income of $186 million and $33 million on contracts that have and have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes, respectively. On December 31, 2005, we had outstanding forward exchange and options contracts with notional amounts of $1,023 million and $167 million, respectively, that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges 80 Table of Contents of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. These contracts had net unrealized gains totaling $29 million on December 31, 2005. Also, on December 31, 2005, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $162 million that hedge fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses on December 31, 2005. With regard to these contracts, a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on December 31, 2005 would result in a reduction in fair value, cash flows and income of $106 million and $16 million on contracts that have and have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes, respectively. The analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions and assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.",2023-12-30 18:04:46.520567
318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and previously filed Form 10-K’s for further information regarding our consolidated results of operations and financial position for periods reported therein and for known factors that will impact comparability of future results. (1) In 2007, we incurred restructuring charges of $739 million ($576 million, net of tax) primarily related to staff separation costs, asset impairment charges, accelerated depreciation and loss accruals for leases for certain R&D facilities that will not be used in our business. (2) In July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Ilypsa for a net purchase price of approximately $400 million. Also in July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Alantos for a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. In October 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Avidia, Inc. (“Avidia”) for a net purchase price of approximately $275 million. In April 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abgenix for a purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion. In August 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Tularik Inc. (“Tularik”) for a purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. Included in operating expenses are acquisition charges of $37 million, $41 million, $12 million, $53 million and $70 million, in 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Acquisition charges, net of tax, for the three-years ended December 31, 2007 were $22 million, $26 million and $7 million, respectively. Acquisition charges consist, where applicable, of the incremental compensation provided to certain employees under short-term retention plans, including non-cash compensation expense associated with stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition, non-cash expense related to valuing the inventory acquired at fair value and external, incremental consulting and systems integration costs directly associated with integrating the acquisition. (3) Included in R&D expenses for 2007 and 2006 is the non-cash amortization of acquired R&D technology rights of $71 million ($44 million, net of tax) and $48 million ($30 million, net of tax), respectively. (4) Primarily represents the non-cash amortization of acquired product technology rights, primarily ENBREL, related to the Immunex acquisition. Amortization charges, net of tax, for the three years ended December 31, 2007 were $185 million, $200 million and $215 million, respectively. (5) As part of the accounting for the acquisitions of Alantos and Ilypsa in 2007, Avidia and Abgenix in 2006 and Tularik in 2004, we recorded charges to write-off acquired in-process R&D (“IPR&D”) of $270 million and $320 million in 2007, respectively, $130 million and $1.1 billion in 2006, respectively, and $554 million in 2004. These charges represent the estimated fair values of the IPR&D that, as of the respective acquisition dates, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. (6) In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due in 2008, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2017 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2037 in a private placement. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of these notes were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under a block trade entered into in May 2007. (7) In February 2006, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 and $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 in a private placement. In connection with the issuance of these notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also, concurrent with the issuance of these notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The cost of the convertible note hedges, which aggregated approximately $1.5 billion, was recorded as a reduction of equity. Also, concurrent with the issuance of these notes, we sold warrants to 65 Table of Contents acquire shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. (8) On March 2, 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their March 1, 2007 put option, we repurchased $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount, or the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1.7 billion in cash. (9) Throughout the five-years ended December 31, 2007 in the table above, we have had share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors through which we have repurchased $5.1 billion, $5.0 billion, $4.4 billion, $4.1 billion and $1.8 billion of Amgen common stock in 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 66 Table of Contents Item 7.

Overview The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to assist the reader in understanding the business of Amgen Inc., including its subsidiaries (referred to as “Amgen,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us”). MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We are a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. As a science-based, patient-focused organization, we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat grievous illness. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products include Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® and ENBREL all of which are sold in the United States. ENBREL is marketed under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth in the United States and Canada. Our international product sales consist principally of European sales of Aranesp® and Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®. For additional information about our principal products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see “Item 1. Business — Principal Products.” We operate in a highly regulated industry and various U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we conduct our business in those countries. Government authorities in the United States and in other countries regulate the manufacturing and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities. For example, prior to obtaining regulatory approval to market a product, we must conduct extensive clinical studies designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for use in humans in the indications sought. Furthermore, in order to maintain regulatory approval to market a product, we may be required to conduct further clinical trials and to provide additional information on safety and effectiveness. The regulatory environment is evolving and there is increased scrutiny on drug safety and increased authority being granted to regulatory bodies, in particular the FDA, to assist in ensuring the safety of therapeutic products. For example, on September 27, 2007, President Bush signed into law the FDAAA, significantly adding to the FDA’s authority (see “Item 1. Business — Government Regulation”). 67 Table of Contents Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by either government and/or private payer health care programs. The reimbursement environment is evolving with greater emphasis on cost containment. For example, failure to demonstrate a clear economic value associated with the use of a new therapeutic product as compared to existing therapeutic products or practices may result in reduced reimbursement. Therefore, sales of our products are and will continue to be affected by the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government and private insurance plans and administration of those programs. Governments may regulate access to, prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures. Further, safety signals or adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators) or from the marketed use of our drugs may expand safety labeling or restrict the use for our approved products and may negatively impact worldwide reimbursement for our products. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see “Item 1. Business — Reimbursement.” For the year ended December 31, 2007, total revenues were $14.8 billion and net income was $3.2 billion, or $2.82 per share on a diluted basis. In addition to the factors noted in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 were negatively impacted by the write-off of $590 million of acquired IPR&D related to the acquisitions of Alantos and Ilypsa and charges of $739 million in connection with our previously announced restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2007, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.2 billion, of which approximately $6.2 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. If these funds are repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. Our total debt outstanding was $11.2 billion as of December 31, 2007. Our product sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $14.3 billion representing an increase of $453 million, or 3%, over product sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase reflects growth primarily in ENBREL and Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® significantly offset by a decline in Aranesp®. The decline in sales of Aranesp® , in particular Aranesp® sales in the U.S. supportive cancer care segment, reflects a decrease in demand resulting from various regulatory and reimbursement developments in 2007, as discussed below. International product sales in 2007 represented 20% of total product sales and consisted principally of European sales of Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. International product sales grew 17% in 2007 to $2.9 billion, principally driven by sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International product sales growth during 2007 was favorably impacted by $193 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. Both the positive and negative impacts that movements in foreign currency exchange rates have on our international product sales are mitigated, in part, by the natural, opposite impact these exchange rate movements have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income. As such, the impact to our net results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated. As discussed in more detail in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” certain of our products, principally our marketed ESA products, face various challenges primarily arising from regulatory and reimbursement developments that began in 2007. The developments impacting our marketed ESA products include revisions to product labels to reflect adverse safety results in various clinical studies involving ESA products performed by us and others and the loss of or significant restrictions on reimbursements. Furthermore, our ESA products continue to face future challenges, including the potential for further revisions to product labels and changes to reimbursement. These developments have had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of our ESA marketed products, in particular Aranesp® sales in the U.S. supportive cancer care segment. In addition, increased competition, including additional approved indications for existing products, has and will continue to present challenges to certain of our products. 68 Table of Contents As a result of the above developments, in particular the regulatory and reimbursement changes that began in 2007 involving ESA products, and their resulting impact on our operations, on August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant R&D investments and build the framework for our future growth. In connection with the implementation of our restructuring plan, we currently estimate that we will incur $775 million to $825 million of restructuring charges. Included in such amounts are (i) severance related costs of $185 million to $200 million with respect to staff reductions, aggregating approximately 2,200 to 2,600 positions or approximately 12% to 14% of our worldwide staff; (ii) asset related charges of $450 million to $470 million primarily consisting of asset impairments and accelerated depreciation resulting from rationalizing our worldwide network of manufacturing facilities in order to gain cost efficiencies while continuing to meet future commercial and clinical demand for our products and product candidates and, to a lesser degree, changes to certain R&D capital projects and (iii) other costs of $140 million to $155 million, principally related to the accrual of losses for leases for certain R&D facilities that will not be used in our operations. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we completed the majority of the above-noted actions and incurred $739 million of restructuring costs. We expect that substantially all remaining restructuring actions, discussed above, will be completed and the related estimated costs incurred in 2008. In connection with our efforts to improve our cost structure, we refocused our spending on critical R&D and operational priorities and sought greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business, including optimizing ongoing clinical trials and trial initiation. These efforts will assist in allowing us to provide continued support of key activities including (i) current and future postmarketing studies, including those with respect to our ESA products, Aranesp® and EPOGEN®; (ii) regulatory affairs, safety and compliance functions; (iii) clinical studies to advance our late-stage pipeline; (iv) the advancement of earlier stage compounds and (v) research efforts in the core areas of oncology, inflammation, bone and metabolic disorders. In order to continue advancing our expanding pipeline of product candidates and to assist in ensuring that patients around the world are able to benefit from our future products, we are also seeking partners to assist in the development of selected product candidates in our pipeline in certain countries and/or worldwide. For example, in July 2007 we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, which provided them the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize denosumab in Japan in PMO and oncology with the potential for additional indications. In February 2008, we entered into a license agreement with Takeda, which provided them the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize for the Japanese market up to 13 early to mid-stage molecules from our pipeline across a range of therapeutic areas, including oncology and inflammation. The molecules covered by the license agreement primarily include: AMG 108, AMG 317, AMG 386, AMG 479, AMG 655 and Vectibix™ (panitumumab). Amgen has the right to participate in the promotion of these products in Japan. In addition, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda for the worldwide development and commercialization of motesanib diphosphate (AMG 706). Each party has the right to participate in the commercialization of motesanib diphosphate in the other party’s territory. In connection with these agreements, Takeda has agreed to acquire our subsidiary in Japan, Amgen K.K. On July 16, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Alantos, which was accounted for as a business combination. Alantos was a privately held company that specialized in the development of drugs for the treatment of diabetes and inflammatory diseases. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid cash of approximately $300 million to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Alantos. The transaction provides Amgen with Alantos’ lead drug candidate, a DPP-IV inhibitor in clinical development (phase 2a) for the treatment of type II diabetes. On July 18, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Ilypsa, which was accounted for as a business combination. Ilypsa was a privately held company that specialized in the development of non-absorbed drugs for renal disorders. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid cash of approximately $400 million to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Ilypsa. The transaction provides Amgen with Ilypsa’s lead drug candidate, a phosphate binder in clinical development (phase 2) for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on hemodialysis. 69 Table of Contents There are many economic and industry-wide factors that affect our business generally and uniquely, including, among others, those relating to increased complexity and cost of R&D due, in part, to greater scrutiny of clinical trials with respect to safety which may lead to fewer treatments being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies and/or safety-related label changes for approved products; increasingly intense competition for marketed products and product candidates; reimbursement changes; healthcare provider prescribing behavior, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; complex and expanding regulatory requirements; and intellectual property protection. (See “Item 1. Business” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information on these economic and industry-wide factors and their impact and potential impact on our business.) Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Aranesp® $ 3,614 (12 )% $ 4,121 26 % $ 3,273 EPOGEN® 2,489 (1 )% 2,511 2 % 2,455 Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® 4,277 9 % 3,923 12 % 3,504 ENBREL 3,230 12 % 2,879 12 % 2,573 Sensipar® 463 44 % 321 104 % 157 Vectibix™ 170 336 % 39 n/a — Other 68 6 % 64 7 % 60 Total product sales $ 14,311 3 % $ 13,858 15 % $ 12,022 Total U.S. $ 11,443 0 % $ 11,397 15 % $ 9,892 Total International 2,868 17 % 2,461 16 % 2,130 Total product sales $ 14,311 3 % $ 13,858 15 % $ 12,022 Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, government programs, regulatory developments or guidelines, clinical trial outcomes, clinical practice, pricing strategies, wholesaler and end-user inventory management practices, patient population, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, new product launches and indications, competitive products, product supply and acquisitions. (See “Item 1. Business — Principal Products” for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) Sales growth in 2007 was principally driven by ENBREL and Neulasta® sales, which was substantially offset by a decline in Aranesp® sales. In particular for the year ended December 31, 2007, U.S. Aranesp® sales declined 23%, primarily reflecting a decrease in demand resulting from recent regulatory and reimbursement developments as discussed in more detail below. Sales growth in 2006 was principally driven by demand for Aranesp®, Neulasta® and ENBREL, which benefited from share gains and/or market growth. International product sales growth in 2007 was favorably impacted by $193 million and unfavorably impacted by $13 million in 2006 from foreign currency exchange rate changes. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international product sales increased 9% and 16% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. 70 Table of Contents Aranesp® For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Aranesp® — U.S. $ 2,154 (23 )% $ 2,790 33 % $ 2,104 Aranesp® — International 1,460 10 % 1,331 14 % 1,169 Total Aranesp® $ 3,614 (12 )% $ 4,121 26 % $ 3,273 The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was principally driven by a decline in demand. This decline primarily reflects physician conformance to label and reimbursement changes that occurred throughout 2007, primarily in the supportive cancer care setting and, to a lesser extent, a decline in our segment share. Given the timing of these label and reimbursement changes, their impact was primarily realized in the second half of 2007, with U.S. Aranesp® sales experiencing a decrease of 38% compared to the second half of 2006. During the latter part of the three months ended December 31, 2007, Aranesp® sales began to stabilize within a reasonable range as physicians incorporated into their anemia management approaches the new labels and reimbursement changes. In particular, these developments, which are discussed in more detail in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” include the Decision Memorandum issued by CMS on July 30, 2007, which significantly restricts Medicare reimbursement for use of Aranesp® in CIA and which we believe has also negatively impacted Aranesp® use in CIA for patients covered by private insurance plans. In addition, these developments include a significant decline in Aranesp® use in AoC throughout 2007 and the ESA product label changes in the United States, which occurred on March 9, 2007 and November 8, 2007. The increase in international Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily driven by favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes of $100 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 2%. International sales were negatively impacted in Europe by dosing conservatism in the oncology segment and pricing pressures across all ESAs. Through December 31, 2007, biosimilars and other recently introduced marketed products in Europe have not had a significant impact on Aranesp® sales. The increase in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily driven by demand reflecting segment growth and share gains. The growth in U.S. Aranesp® sales also reflects increased Aranesp® usage in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics from continued conversion from EPOGEN®, which we believe stabilized in mid-2006. The increase in international Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was also principally driven by demand. In addition to the factors mentioned in the “Product sales” section above, future worldwide Aranesp® sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: • reimbursement developments including: ¡ CMS Decision Memorandum issued on July 30, 2007 which significantly restricts Medicare reimbursement for the use of Aranesp® in CIA and any related impact on private payers’ reimbursement or healthcare providers’ prescribing behavior; ¡ reimbursement changes resulting from current or future product label changes; ¡ reimbursement and cost containment pressures by third-party payers, including governments and private insurance plans; • regulatory developments, including: ¡ product label changes occurring on November 8, 2007 and March 9, 2007 in the United States for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp® and EPOGEN®; ¡ pending product label changes in the United States for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp® and EPOGEN®, as a result of discussions with the FDA regarding safety data from the PREPARE and GOG-191 studies and the submission of a PAS in December 2007 that addressed questions raised at the May 10, 2007 ODAC meeting; 71 Table of Contents ¡ potential for additional label changes for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp®, resulting from the ODAC meeting on March 13, 2008; ¡ pending changes to product information from the EMEA for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp®, in Europe; • our ability to maintain a competitive segment share and differentiate Aranesp® from current and potential future competition; • adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us, including our pharmacovigilance clinical trials, or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), such as those referred to in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” which have and could further impact product safety labeling, negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; • an increasingly competitive environment of products or therapies, including biosimilar products which have launched in certain countries outside of the United States, for example Roche’s peg-EPO product, MIRCERA® and Shire’s erythropoietin product Dynepo® (Epoetin delta), and biosimilar products that have been or are expected to be launched in the future; and • development of new treatments for cancer and future chemotherapy treatments. For example, those that are less myelosuppressive may require less Aranesp®; any or all of which could have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp®. See “Item 1. Business — Key Developments” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” herein for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. EPOGEN® For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 EPOGEN® — U.S. $ 2,489 (1 )% $ 2,511 2 % $ 2,455 The decline in EPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects a decrease in demand due to a decline in dose/utilization, partially offset by patient population growth of 3%. The decline in dose/utilization is due to physician behavior in making treatment and dosing decisions in response to regulatory and reimbursement developments, that occurred throughout 2007. As discussed in more detail in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” these developments include the issuance by the NKF of the final KDOQI guidelines, the March 9, 2007 and November 8, 2007 ESA product label changes and the anticipation of CMS’ announced revisions to its EMP, effective January 1, 2008. The decline in sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was partially offset by favorable changes in wholesaler inventory and spillover (see Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies — Product sales” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). Reported EPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased modestly primarily due to the increased demand in the free-standing dialysis centers partially offset by the increased use of Aranesp® in the hospital setting. We believe that conversion to Aranesp® in the hospital setting stabilized in mid-2006. We believe demand for EPOGEN® in the free-standing dialysis centers, which account for the majority of the EPOGEN® sales, remained consistent with patient population growth. In addition to the factors mentioned in the “Product sales” section above, future EPOGEN® sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: • reimbursement developments including: ¡ reimbursement changes resulting from CMS’ announced revisions to its EMP, effective January 1, 2008; 72 Table of Contents ¡ reimbursement changes resulting from current or future product label changes; ¡ changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government; • regulatory developments, including: ¡ product label changes occurring on November 8, 2007 and March 9, 2007 in the United States for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp® and EPOGEN®; ¡ pending product label changes in the United States for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp® and EPOGEN®, as a result of discussions with the FDA regarding safety data from the PREPARE and GOG-191 studies and the submission of a PAS in December 2007 that addressed questions raised at the May 10, 2007 ODAC meeting; • governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products, including: ¡ changes in medical guidelines resulting from the NKF issuance of the final KDOQI guidelines; ¡ legislative actions; • adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us, including our pharmacovigilance clinical trials, or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), such as those referred to in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” which have and could further impact product safety labeling, negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • cost containment pressures from the federal government on healthcare providers; and • pricing strategies; any or all of which could have a material adverse impact on future sales of EPOGEN®. See “Item 1. Business — Key Developments” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Neulasta® — U.S. $ 2,351 6 % $ 2,217 17 % $ 1,900 NEUPOGEN® — U.S. 861 4 % 830 3 % 805 U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total 3,212 5 % 3,047 13 % 2,705 Neulasta® — International 649 32 % 493 27 % 388 NEUPOGEN® — International 416 9 % 383 (7 )% 411 International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total 1,065 22 % 876 10 % 799 Total Worldwide Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® $ 4,277 9 % $ 3,923 12 % $ 3,504 The increase in U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was driven by demand for Neulasta® primarily due to segment growth and, to a lesser degree, favorable changes to wholesaler inventory levels. The increase in international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was driven by the continued conversion to Neulasta® from NEUPOGEN® and changes in foreign exchange, which positively impacted the year ended December 31, 2007 combined sales by $74 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, combined international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales increased 13%. 73 Table of Contents The increase in U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta®, reflecting segment growth. In addition, the increase in demand for Neulasta® for the year ended December 31, 2006 also includes the impact of a price increase in April 2006. U.S. demand for Neulasta® continued to benefit from a product label extension based on clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle utilization in moderate-high risk chemotherapy regimens. The increase in international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta®. In addition to the factors mentioned in the “Product sales” section above, future worldwide Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: • penetration of existing segments; • competitive products or therapies, including biosimilar products that may be approved in the EU sometime in 2008 and be available shortly thereafter; • reimbursement by third-party payers, including governments and private insurance plans; • adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could expand safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; • cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; • our ability to minimize distraction due to ESA issues; • pricing strategies; • patient growth; and • development of new treatments for cancer and future chemotherapy treatments. For example, those that are less myelosuppressive may require less Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®, however, other future chemotherapy treatments that are more myelosuppressive, such as dose dense chemotherapy, could require more Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. ENBREL For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 ENBREL — U.S. $ 3,052 12 % $ 2,736 11 % $ 2,470 ENBREL — International 178 24 % 143 39 % 103 Total ENBREL $ 3,230 12 % $ 2,879 12 % $ 2,573 ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2007 was driven by demand due to increases in both patients and net sales price. While ENBREL continued to maintain a leading position in both rheumatology and dermatology, the sales growth during the year ended December 31, 2007 was affected by slight share declines in the United States in both segments versus the prior year due to increased competitive activity. ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven by increased demand in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. The increase in demand for the year ended December 31, 2006 also includes the impact of a U.S. price increase. While ENBREL continued to maintain a leading position in both rheumatology and dermatology, we have experienced moderate share loss in both segments in 2006 compared to 2005. ENBREL sales growth was also affected in 2006 by slowing segment growth in dermatology and by increased competitive activities in both segments. 74 Table of Contents In addition to the factors mentioned in the “Product sales” section above, future worldwide ENBREL sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: • the effects of competing products or therapies, which may include new indications for existing products such as a treatment for adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis for HUMIRA®, and new competitive products coming to market, such as J&J’s CNTO 1275 (ustekinumab) and CNTO 148 (golimumab) and, in part, our ability to differentiate ENBREL based on its safety profile and efficacy; • pending change to the patient safety information in the form of a boxed warning that will apply to the ENBREL label as has been the case with other TNF inhibitor agents; • growth in the rheumatology and dermatology segments; • impact of converting from primarily drop-shipping orders directly to pharmacies to a wholesaler distribution model primarily occurring in the three months ending March 31, 2008; • the availability, extent and access to reimbursement by government and third-party payers; • adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could expand safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; • cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; • pricing strategies; and • penetration of existing and new segments, including potential new indications. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes our product sales and operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Product sales $ 14,311 3 % $ 13,858 15 % $ 12,022 Operating expenses: Cost of sales (excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets) $ 2,548 22 % $ 2,095 1 % $ 2,082 % of product sales 18 % 15 % 17 % Research and development $ 3,266 (3 )% $ 3,366 45 % $ 2,314 % of product sales 23 % 24 % 19 % Selling, general and administrative $ 3,361 0 % $ 3,366 21 % $ 2,790 % of product sales 23 % 24 % 23 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 298 $ 370 $ 347 Write-off of acquired in-process research and development $ 590 $ 1,231 $ — Other items (primarily certain restructuring costs in 2007) $ 728 $ — $ 49 Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets (see “Consolidated Statements of Income”), increased 22% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily driven by restructuring and related charges, discussed below, product mix due to higher sales of ENBREL, excess capacity 75 Table of Contents charges at our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico and the write-off of excess inventory related to certain new product presentations. The Company expects excess capacity charges to continue to occur through 2008 due principally to declining product sales and related demand for Aranesp® resulting from regulatory and reimbursement developments. Included in costs of sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 are restructuring charges of $150 million, primarily related to accelerated depreciation resulting from the decision to accelerate the closure of one of our ENBREL commercial bulk manufacturing operations in connection with the rationalization of our worldwide network of manufacturing facilities. See Note 2, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In addition, cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes a $90 million write-off of excess inventory related to changing regulatory and reimbursement environments. Cost of sales increased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to lower royalties and a more favorable product mix and cost efficiencies at our factories. Royalty expenses were lower due to the expiration of certain contractual royalty obligations on Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® sales and the acquisition of certain royalty rights on sales of ENBREL and EU Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® sales. Research and development R&D expenses are primarily comprised of costs and expenses for salaries and benefits associated with R&D personnel, overhead and occupancy, clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing, including contract services and other outside costs, process development, quality assurance, information systems and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses also include such costs related to activities performed on behalf of corporate partners and cost recoveries from collaboration partners. R&D expenses decreased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was primarily attributable to reductions in in-licensing expenses of approximately $95 million primarily due to our agreement with Cytokinetics entered into in 2006 and a $50 million benefit in 2007 from third-party collaborations primarily with respect to out-licensing denosumab in Japan to Daiichi Sankyo. These decreases in R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were partially offset by $19 million of restructuring costs, comprised of $38 million in charges related to asset impairments offset by a $19 million benefit associated with the reversal of previously accrued expenses for bonuses and stock-based compensation awards, which were forfeited as a result of the employees’ termination. See Note 2, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In 2006, R&D expenses increased 45% over the prior year, primarily due to higher staff levels and increased funding necessary to support clinical trials for our late-stage programs, which included denosumab, our late-stage investigational product for PMO and bone metastasis, and the continued expansion of our research and pre-clinical organization to build the capacity to advance more compounds into and through the clinic. In addition, R&D for the year ended December 31, 2006, includes approximately $48 million in non-cash amortization expense for the intangible asset, XenoMouse® technology, acquired in the Abgenix acquisition. In 2006, staff-related costs, including stock option compensation, and clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately $467 million and $355 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; outside marketing expenses including Wyeth profit share; overhead and occupancy costs; other legal costs; and other general and administrative costs. SG&A remained relatively unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, outside legal costs increased $53 million and outside marketing costs increased approximately $59 million. The increase in outside marketing is primarily due to an increase in Wyeth profit share, partially offset by reductions in promotion and advertising on marketed products. These increases were offset by approximately $124 million in expense recoveries associated with our restructuring. See Note 2, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 76 Table of Contents Pursuant to our co-promotion agreement, we share profits on sales of ENBREL in the United States and Canada with Wyeth (see “Item 1. Business — Joint Ventures and Business Relationships”). For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Wyeth profit share expenses, excluding recoveries associated with our restructuring, were approximately 30% and 25%, respectively, of total SG&A. SG&A increased 21% for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to higher staff levels and additional infrastructure costs to support the growing organization, in particular our Global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system, higher Wyeth profit share expenses related to ENBREL sales and higher legal costs associated with ongoing litigation. SG&A costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 included approximately $120 million in stock option expense, which was not reflected in our results of operations prior to January 1, 2006. Staff-related costs, including stock option compensation and additional infrastructure costs increased over 2005 by $323 million and $59 million, respectively. In addition, outside marketing expenses and legal costs increased by $198 million and $38 million, respectively. The increase in outside marketing expenses was in support of our principal products, including the Wyeth profit share related to increased ENBREL sales growth in 2006 as compared to 2005. Amortization of acquired intangible assets Amortization of acquired intangible assets relates to products technology rights acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition. In 2007 and 2006, this amortization also included $3 million and $49 million, respectively, related to the impairment of a non-ENBREL related intangible asset previously acquired in the Immunex acquisition. Write-off of acquired in-process research and development The fair value of acquired IPR&D projects, which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition, are immediately expensed. In 2007, we wrote-off a total of $590 million of acquired IPR&D. This amount is comprised of $270 million in connection with the Alantos acquisition related to an orally administered treatment for type II diabetes that at the date of acquisition was in phase 2a clinical trials and $320 million in connection with the Ilypsa acquisition related to a phosphate binder that at the date of acquisition was in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on hemodialysis. In 2006, we wrote-off $1.1 billion of acquired IPR&D related to the Abgenix acquisition and $130 million of acquired IPR&D in connection with the Avidia acquisition. The Abgenix IPR&D amount is primarily comprised of approximately $770 million related to the rights which we did not own pursuant to our agreement with Abgenix to jointly develop and commercialize panitumumab and approximately $330 million related to a royalty that we would have owed to Abgenix with respect to future sales of denosumab as a result of using certain of Abgenix’s patented technology in the development of this product candidate. Panitumumab was Abgenix’s fully human monoclonal antibody which, at acquisition, was in phase 2/3 clinical trials for the treatment of certain types of cancer. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is a key mediator of the resorptive phase of bone remodeling and was in phase 2/3 clinical trials for various types of bone diseases at the time of the Abgenix acquisition. There were no individually significant IPR&D projects acquired and written off in the acquisition of Avidia. We used the “income method” to determine the estimated fair values of acquired IPR&D, which uses a discounted cash flow model and applies a probability weighting based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimated future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs. These success rates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates. These cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 10%. The estimated after-tax cash flows were probability weighted at success rates of 38% for the Alantos product candidate, 77% for the Ilypsa product candidate, and 43% to 85% for the Abgenix product candidates. The incremental R&D expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approval for the Alantos and Ilypsa product candidates are immaterial. The incremental R&D expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the various indications of panitumumab were estimated at the time of acquisition at approximately $300 million and would be incurred 77 Table of Contents through 2011. The elimination of the royalty on potential future sales of denosumab did not result in us incurring any incremental R&D expenses. The above assumptions were used solely for the purposes of estimating fair values of these product candidates as of the date of their acquisition. However, we cannot provide assurance that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization will materialize, as estimated. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization of these product candidates are our ability to confirm their safety and efficacy based on data from clinical trials, our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and our ability to successfully complete these tasks within budgeted costs. We are not able to market a human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D may vary from its estimated value at the date of acquisition. At the date of acquisition, we intended to develop panitumumab for treatment of various types of cancer. Panitumumab received FDA approval in late September 2006 for the treatment of mCRC after disease progression on, or following, fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens and is marketed under the trademark Vectibix™. In December 2007, the European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorization for Vectibix™ as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing mCRC with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS genes after failure of standard chemotherapy regimens. We are continuing to develop or are evaluating plans to develop Vectibix™ in all of the remaining indications we had intended at the date of acquisition. However, since the acquisition, there have been several events that have affected the development plans for Vectibix™, such as the results of our PACCE trial and KRAS biomarker analysis discussed in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments.” Because of these developments, our expected time to obtain regulatory approvals for the remaining indications has been delayed compared to our original expectations. Our development efforts with respect to denosumab are continuing. In addition, we are continuing to develop the product candidates acquired in the Alantos and Ilypsa acquisitions. Other items (primarily certain restructuring costs in 2007) As discussed in Note 2, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant R&D investments and build the framework for our future growth. As a result of this restructuring plan, we recorded in “Other items (primarily certain restructuring costs in 2007)” charges for staff separation costs of $209 million, asset impairments of $366 million and other charges of $119 million primarily related to the loss accruals for leases for certain R&D facilities that will not be used in our business. Also in 2007, the Company recorded in “Other items (primarily certain restructuring costs in 2007)” a loss accrual for an ongoing commercial legal proceeding and recorded an expense of $34 million. In 2005, Other items (primarily certain restructuring costs in 2007) consisted of a $49 million charge, net of amounts previously accrued, for settling certain legal matters associated with a patent legal proceeding. Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 20.1%, 26.6% and 24.5% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to the lesser amount of the write-off of nondeductible acquired IPR&D costs in 2007 than 2006 and the greater tax benefit from the favorable resolutions of our prior years’ income tax examinations in 2007 than 2006. Our effective tax rate for 2006 increased over 2005 primarily due to the write-off of non-deductible acquired IPR&D costs in connection with the acquisitions of Abgenix and Avidia. The increase in the rate was partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States, the absence of tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act and favorable audit settlements. 78 Table of Contents As permitted in Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes — Special Areas,” we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. (See Note 5, “Income taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Recent and proposed accounting pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141(R), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141(R)”) and SFAS No. 160, “Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51” (“SFAS 160”). These standards will significantly change the accounting and reporting for business combination transactions and noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements, including capitalizing at the acquisition date the fair value of acquired IPR&D, and remeasuring and writing down these assets, if necessary, in subsequent periods during their development. These new standards will be applied prospectively for business combinations that occur on or after January 1, 2009, except that presentation and disclosure requirements of SFAS 160 regarding noncontrolling interests shall be applied retrospectively. In December 2007, the FASB ratified EITF No. 07-1, “Accounting for Collaborative Agreements” (“EITF 07-1”). EITF 07-1 provides guidance regarding financial statement presentation and disclosure of collaborative arrangements, as defined, which includes arrangements the Company has entered into regarding development and commercialization of products and product candidates. EITF 07-1 is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2009, and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF No. 07-3, “Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities” (“EITF 07-3”), which requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used or rendered in future R&D activities pursuant to executory contractual arrangements be deferred and recognized as an expense in the period that the related goods are delivered or services are performed. EITF No. 07-3 became effective as of January 1, 2008 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position upon adoption. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurement” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 became effective as issued on January 1, 2008 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position upon adoption. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing rules for recognition, measurement and classification in our consolidated financial statements of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For tax benefits to be recognized under FIN 48, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. There was no cumulative effect of applying the recognition and measurement provisions upon adoption of FIN 48. FIN 48 also provides guidance on the balance sheet classification of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (“UTBs”) as either current or non-current depending on the expected timing of payments. Upon adoption of FIN 48, we reclassified approximately $240 million of UTBs and related accrued interest from current income taxes payable to other non-current liabilities. Interest and penalties related to UTBs are classified as a component of our provision for income taxes. See Note 5, “Income taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In August 2007, the FASB exposed for public comment a proposed FSP that would change the method of accounting for convertible debt securities that requires or permits settlement in cash either in whole or in part upon conversion (“cash settled convertible debt securities”), which includes our convertible debt securities, and 79 Table of Contents would require the proposed method to be retrospectively applied. The FASB expects to begin deliberations on the proposed FSP in February 2008. The FSP, if issued as proposed, would become effective for calendar year end companies like us in the first quarter of 2008. Under this proposed method of accounting, the debt and equity components of our convertible debt securities would be bifurcated and accounted for separately in a manner that would result in recognizing interest on these securities at effective rates more comparable to what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms. The equity component of our convertible debt securities would be included in the paid-in-capital section of stockholders’ equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and, accordingly, the initial carrying values of these debt securities would be reduced. Our net income for financial reporting purposes would be reduced by recognizing the accretion of the reduced carrying values of our convertible debt securities to their face amounts as additional non-cash interest expense. Therefore, if the proposed method of accounting for cash settled convertible debt securities is adopted by the FASB as described above, it would have an adverse impact on our past and future reported financial results. As the final guidance has not been issued, we cannot predict its ultimate outcome. We also cannot predict any other changes in GAAP that may be made affecting accounting for convertible debt securities, some of which could have an adverse impact on our past or future reported financial results. For additional discussion on this issue, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — The accounting method for our convertible debt securities may be subject to change.” Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data (in millions): December 31, 2007 2006 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 7,151 $ 6,277 Total assets 34,639 33,788 Current debt 2,000 1,798 Non-current debt 9,177 7,214 Stockholders’ equity 17,869 18,964 We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, as well as to support our stock repurchase programs and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2007, approximately $6.2 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. If these funds are repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. The primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return, consistent with these two objectives. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. 80 Table of Contents Financing arrangements The following table reflects the carrying value of our long-term borrowings under our various financing arrangements as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 (in millions): 2007 2006 0.125% convertible notes due 2011 (2011 Convertible Notes) $ 2,500 $ 2,500 0.375% convertible notes due 2013 (2013 Convertible Notes) 2,500 2,500 Floating rate notes due 2008 (2008 Floating Rate Notes) 2,000 — 5.85% notes due 2017 (2017 Notes) 1,099 — 4.85% notes due 2014 (2014 Notes) 1,000 1,000 4.00% notes due 2009 (2009 Notes) 999 999 6.375% notes due 2037 (2037 Notes) 899 — Zero coupon 30 year modified convertible notes due in 2032 (2032 Modified Convertible Notes) 80 1,778 Other 100 235 Total borrowings 11,177 9,012 Less current portion 2,000 1,798 Total non-current debt $ 9,177 $ 7,214 In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due in November 2008 (the “2008 Floating Rate Notes”), $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2017 (the “2017 Notes”) and $900 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2037 (the “2037 Notes”) in a private placement. The 2008 Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 0.08%, which is reset quarterly. We may redeem the 2008 Floating Rate Notes, in whole or from time to time in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued interest. The 2017 Notes and 2037 Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 5.85% and 6.375%, respectively. The 2017 Notes and 2037 Notes may be redeemed, in whole of from time to time in part, at 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest, if any, and a “make-whole” amount, as defined. In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a portion of the 2008 Floating Rate Notes, the 2017 Notes and the 2037 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs totaled approximately $16 million and are being amortized over the life of the notes. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of these notes were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under a block trade entered into in May 2007. In February 2006, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the “2011 Convertible Notes”) and $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the “2013 Convertible Notes”) in a private placement. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.125% and 0.375%, respectively. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may be convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 12.5247 shares and 12.5814 shares, respectively, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $79.84 and $79.48 per share, respectively). The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may only be converted (i) during any calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the respective conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous quarter, (ii) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur or (iii) one month prior to the respective maturity date. Upon conversion, a holder would receive (i) cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value, as defined, and (ii) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, shares of our common stock, cash or a combination of common stock and cash, at our option (the “excess conversion value”). In addition, upon a change in control, as defined, the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes for 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In connection with the issuance of these convertible notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible 81 Table of Contents Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash from the counterparties to the transactions equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes upon conversion. These transactions will terminate the earlier of the maturity dates of the related notes or the first day none of the related notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. The cost of the convertible note hedges, which aggregated approximately $1.5 billion, was recorded as a reduction of equity. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 and 2013 Convertible Notes, the repurchase of common stock and the purchase of the convertible note hedges was $439 million. Also concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $107.90 per share in a private placement. Pursuant to these transactions, warrants for approximately 31.3 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2011 and warrants for approximately 31.5 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2013 (the “settlement dates”). If the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be net settled, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had $2.0 billion of long-term notes outstanding. These long-term notes consisted of (i) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% and mature in 2009 (“2009 Note”) and (ii) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.85% and mature in 2014 (“2014 Note”). As of December 31, 2007, we had $180 million of additional debt securities outstanding. These debt securities consisted of (i) $100 million of long-term debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.125% and mature in 2097 (“Century Notes”) and (ii) zero coupon convertible notes due in 2032 with an accreted value of $80 million and having an aggregate face amount of $105 million and yield to maturity of 1.125%. We have a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support, which matures in November 2012. Additionally, we have a commercial paper program, which provides for unsecured, short-term borrowings of up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility or commercial paper program as of December 31, 2007. We have a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement (the “$1.0 Billion Shelf”) which allows us to issue debt securities, common stock and associated preferred share purchase rights, preferred stock, warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, securities purchase contracts, securities purchase units and depositary shares. The $1.0 Billion Shelf was established to provide for further financial flexibility and the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2007, no securities had been issued under the $1.0 Billion Shelf. We have a $400 million debt shelf registration statement whereby the debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for our 2009 Notes, 2014 Notes and Century Notes that effectively convert the payment of these fixed rate notes to LIBOR-based variable interest payments over the life of the respective notes. These interest rate swap agreements qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate face amount of this outstanding fixed interest rate debt of $2.1 billion was covered by these interest rate swap agreements. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate face amount of our outstanding fixed interest rate debt covered by interest rate swap agreements was $2.2 billion, including the 2009 Notes, 2014, Notes, Century Notes and $100 million of other notes that matured and were repaid during 2007 at which time the interest rate swap agreement matured. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and as of December 31, 2007 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. None of our financing arrangements contain any financial 82 Table of Contents covenants. Our outstanding convertible notes and other long-term debt are rated A+ with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A2 with a negative outlook by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,401 $ 5,389 $ 4,911 Net cash used in investing activities (1,992 ) (5,131 ) (59 ) Net cash used in financing activities (2,668 ) (815 ) (4,538 ) Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2007 remained relatively unchanged as higher cash receipts from customers were substantially offset by the timing of payments in the ordinary course of business (see “Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows”). The increase in cash provided by operations for 2006 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by growth in product sales and timing differences of cash payments relating to our tax and other accrued liabilities (see “Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows”). Investing On July 18, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Ilypsa and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $398 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $2 million. On July 16, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Alantos and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $299 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $1 million. On October 24, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Avidia and paid $275 million in cash, net of cash acquired and our existing equity stake in Avidia. In addition, we may be subject to pay additional amounts upon the achievement of certain future events. On April, 1, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Abgenix and paid $2.1 billion in cash to the shareholders of Abgenix to acquire all outstanding shares. In addition, we acquired $252 million in cash, and subsequent to the completion of the acquisition, we paid off $653 million of debt assumed in this transaction. Capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion in 2007 compared with $1.2 billion in 2006 and $867 million in 2005. Capital expenditures in 2007 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity and site expansions in Puerto Rico and other locations and investment in our global ERP system. Capital expenditures in 2006 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity and site expansions in Ireland, Puerto Rico and other locations and costs associated with implementing our ERP system. Capital expenditures in 2005 primarily related to the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion which included a new manufacturing plant for the commercial production of Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® approved by the FDA in September 2005, Thousand Oaks site expansion, Colorado manufacturing expansion and site development to support the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, also approved by the FDA in September 2005. We currently estimate 2008 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $1.0 billion. Financing In December 2006, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of common stock. Additionally, in July 2007, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock. As of December 31, 2007, we had $6.4 billion available for stock repurchases under these authorized stock repurchase programs. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we 83 Table of Contents are restricted from repurchasing shares, and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. Repurchases under our stock repurchase program reflect, in part, our confidence in the long-term value of Amgen common stock. Additionally, we believe that it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders. A summary of our repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars First quarter 8.8 $ 537 46.6 $ 3,374 26.8 $ 1,675 Second quarter 73.9 (1) 4,463 13.0 876 12.1 750 Third quarter 2.5 (1) — 7.3 505 9.5 769 Fourth quarter 1.8 100 3.3 245 14.8 1,236 Total 87.0 $ 5,100 70.2 $ 5,000 63.2 $ 4,430 (1) The total number of shares repurchased during the three months ended June 30, 2007 excludes 2.5 million shares received in July 2007 in connection with the final settlement of a block trade entered into in May 2007. (See “Item 5(c). Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information regarding our stock repurchase programs.) In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2008 Floating Rate Notes, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.85% notes due in 2017 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% notes due in 2037. The 2008 Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum, equal to LIBOR plus 0.08%, which is reset quarterly. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of these notes were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under a block trade entered into in May 2007. For further information on these transactions, see “Financing arrangements” above. On March 2, 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their March 1, 2007 put option, we repurchased $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount, or the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1.7 billion in cash. In December 2007, $100 million of debt securities matured and were repaid. In October 2007, $35 million of debt securities were repaid. In February 2006, we issued $5.0 billion convertible notes, of which $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.125% and are due in 2011 and $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.375% and are due in 2013. In connection with the issuance of these convertible notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also concurrent with the issuance of these convertible notes, we purchased convertible note hedges at a cost of approximately $1.5 billion. The net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2011 and 2013 Convertible Notes, the repurchase of common stock and the purchase of the convertible note hedges was $439 million. Also concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes, we sold 62.8 million warrants to acquire shares of our common stock for proceeds of $774 million, 31.3 million of which may be settled in May 2011 and 31.5 million of which may be settled in May 2013. On March 2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the zero coupon convertible notes due in 2032 exercising their March 1, 2005 put option, we repurchased $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount or approximately 40% of the then outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1.2 billion in cash. We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan. Employee stock option exercises and proceeds from the sale of stock by us pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans provided $277 million, $528 million and $1.1 billion of cash during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. 84 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total Less than1 year 1-3years 4-5years More than5 years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 14,722 $ 2,306 $ 1,384 $ 2,958 (2) $ 8,074 Operating lease obligations 1,231 144 256 200 631 Purchase obligations(3) 2,689 1,309 975 378 27 Unrecognized tax benefits(4) 300 300 — — — Total contractual obligations $ 18,942 $ 4,059 $ 2,615 $ 3,536 $ 8,732 (1) The long-term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007 due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes and the inclusion of future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on the 2009 Notes, the 2011 Convertible Notes, the 2013 Convertible Notes, the 2014 Notes, 2017 Notes, 2037 Notes and the Century Notes at fixed rates of, 4.00%, 0.125%, 0.375%, 4.85%, 5.85%, 6.375% and 8.125%, respectively. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2007 to compute the amount of the future interest payments on our variable rate 2008 Floating Rate Note and interest rate swaps. (2) Holders of the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates, the next of which is March 1, 2012, at the then-accreted value. Consequently, the amount above reflects the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes accreted value on March 1, 2012, the next put date. (See Note 6, “Financing arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes.) (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (i) our long-term supply agreement with BI Pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for ENBREL and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved; (ii) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. (4) In addition to the current liabilities for UTBs included in the table above, long-term liabilities for UTBs (net of federal tax benefits on state taxes) and related accrued interest totaling approximately $600 million at December 31, 2007 are not included in the contractual obligations table because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. In addition to the above table, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third-parties as part of in-licensing and product development programs all of which are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events. Such events could include, but are not limited to, development milestones, regulatory 85 Table of Contents approvals and product sales. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been included in the above table or recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one reporting period. However, if the achievement of the milestones covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the resulting payment obligation would be approximately $1.5 billion. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales, sales incentives and returns Sales of our products are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other incentives (collectively “sales incentives”) and returns. In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell outside the United States are principally distributed to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third-party data and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns. Accruals for sales incentives are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales. Sales incentive accruals are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales incentives are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives were comprised of the following (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Rebates $ 2,156 $ 2,164 $ 1,344 Wholesaler chargebacks 1,649 1,636 1,559 Discounts and other incentives 694 653 891 Total sales incentives $ 4,499 $ 4,453 $ 3,794 Percent of gross product sales 24 % 24 % 24 % Rebates earned in the United States by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers and hospitals are the sales incentives that are most difficult to estimate. These rebates are generally performance-based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually-specified sales volumes and segment share. As a result, the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. These rebates totaled $2.2 billion in 2007, $2.2 billion in 2006 and $1.3 billion in 2005. We believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on our recent experience, changes in annual estimates related to prior 86 Table of Contents annual periods have been less than 1.5% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for such periods. These changes in annual estimates substantially relate to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period. A 1.5% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2007 would have had an impact of approximately $32 million on our 2007 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in “sales incentives” that relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers. These chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $1.6 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability. Amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. However, such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives (in millions): Balance atBeginning ofPeriod Amounts ChargedAgainst ProductSales (1) Payments Balance atEnd ofPeriod Year ended: December 31, 2007 $ 1,079 $ 4,499 $ 4,514 $ 1,064 December 31, 2006 $ 864 $ 4,453 $ 4,238 $ 1,079 (1) Includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates. Such amounts represented approximately 1% of incentive amounts charged against product sales for both 2007 and 2006. Accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales. Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have been insignificant, amounting to approximately 1% of gross product sales. Deferred income taxes Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact our future effective tax rate. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 10, “Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. 87 Table of Contents In addition, our income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and various state and foreign tax authorities. Significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items, one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of acquired intangible assets We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in-process product candidates as well as goodwill arising in business combinations. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: • determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in-process projects, • projecting regulatory approvals, • estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects and • developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a global biotechnology company with operations in various countries. We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting appropriate credit limits, requiring collateral and obtaining credit insurance, where appropriate. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments in certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer. We also enter into various types of derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. In 2007, the U.S. economy was affected by increased defaults on consumer subprime mortgages, which caused a tightening in the credit market and created volatility in the capital markets. In an attempt to increase liquidity and stimulate the economy, the U.S. federal government has recently reduced the interest rate charged to institutional borrowers. Short term interest rates have declined into early 2008 and may fluctuate in the near term in excess of historical norms. As a result, in the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 20% from those at December 31, 2007. Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our investment portfolio of available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was comprised primarily of fixed rate U.S. treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government agencies and corporate debt instruments and, to a lesser degree, other interest bearing securities. The fair value of our investment portfolio was $6.7 billion and $6.1 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The fair value of our investment portfolio is more sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates than the income it generates because of the significant composition of fixed rate securities. A hypothetical change in interest rates of 20% relative to interest rates at December 31, 2007 and a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2006 would not have a material effect on the fair values of these securities or our cash flows or income. 88 Table of Contents On December 31, 2007, we had outstanding debt of $11.2 billion with a fair value of $10.6 billion, including $5.1 billion of convertible debt with a fair value of $4.5 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2007 was comprised of $9.2 billion of debt with fixed interest rates and $2.0 billion of debt with variable interest rates. On December 31, 2006, we had $9.0 billion of outstanding fixed rate debt with a fair value of $8.9 billion, including $6.8 billion of convertible debt with a fair value of $6.7 billion. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on our fixed rate debt. A hypothetical 20% change in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2007 would not have a material impact on income or cash flows on our $2.0 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2007. Changes in interest rates would affect the fair values of all of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2007 and 2006, including, to a lesser extent, our variable rate debt for which the interest rate resets quarterly. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap agreements, which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed rate debt with carrying values totaling $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These agreements swap the receipt of fixed interest payments for LIBOR-based variable interest payments over the lives of the respective notes. A hypothetical 20% change in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2007 would result in a change of approximately $460 million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt and would not have a material effect on the fair value, cash flows or income with respect to our interest rate swap agreements. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2006 would not have a material impact on the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt or on fair values, cash flows or income with respect to our interest rate swap agreements. Market price sensitive instruments As noted above, a portion of our outstanding debt may be converted into our common stock in certain circumstances. Accordingly, the price of our common stock may affect the fair value of our convertible debt. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the price of Amgen stock from the price at December 31, 2007 and 2006 would have reduced the fair value of our then outstanding convertible debt by approximately $78 million and $274 million, respectively. On December 31, 2007 and 2006, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio on December 31, 2007 and 2006 was not material. Foreign currency sensitive instruments Our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately the Euro, as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets. Both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural, opposite impact that foreign exchange rates have on our international operating expenses. To further reduce our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts. On December 31, 2007, we had outstanding forward exchange and options contracts with notional amounts of $1.4 billion and $788 million, respectively. On December 31, 2006, we had outstanding forward exchange and options contracts with notional amounts of $1.6 billion and $902 million, respectively. These contracts are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 the net unrealized losses on these contracts were not material. With regard to these contracts, a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 would result in a reduction in fair value, cash flows and income of approximately $160 million and $185 million, respectively. Also on December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $622 million and $326 million, respectively that hedge fluctuations of certain assets and li- 89 Table of Contents abilities denominated in foreign currencies but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. With regard to these contracts, a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 would not have a material impact on fair value, cash flows or income. The analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions and assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.",2023-12-30 18:05:05.730997
318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and previously filed Form 10-K’s for further information regarding our consolidated results of operations and financial position for periods reported therein and for known factors that will impact comparability of future results. (1) In 2008 and 2007, we incurred restructuring charges of $148 million ($111 million, net of tax) and $739 million ($576 million, net of tax), respectively, primarily related to staff separation costs, asset impairment charges, accelerated depreciation (in 2007) and loss accruals for leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our business. (2) In 2008, we completed the acquisition of Dompé Biotec, S.p.A (“Dompé”). The purchase price paid was approximately $168 million, which included the carrying value of our existing 49% ownership in Dompé. In July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Ilypsa, Inc. (“Ilypsa”) for a net purchase price of approximately $400 million. Also in July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Alantos Pharmaceuticals Holding, Inc. (“Alantos”) for a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. In October 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Avidia, Inc. (“Avidia”) for a net purchase price of approximately $275 million. In April 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abgenix for a purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion. In August 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Tularik Inc. (“Tularik”) for a purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. Included in operating expenses are acquisition-related charges of $1 million, $37 million, $41 million, $12 million and $53 million, in 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Acquisition charges, net of tax, for the three years ended December 31, 2008 were $1 million, $22 million and $26 million, respectively. Acquisition charges consist of, where applicable, the incremental compensation provided to certain employees under short-term retention plans, including non-cash compensation expense associated with stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition, non-cash expense related to valuing the inventory acquired at fair value, which is in excess of our manufacturing cost, and external, incremental consulting and systems integration costs directly associated with integrating the acquired company. 68 Table of Contents (3) Included in R&D expenses for 2008, 2007 and 2006 is the non-cash amortization of acquired R&D technology rights of $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $71 million ($44 million, net of tax) and $48 million ($30 million, net of tax), respectively. (4) Primarily represents the non-cash amortization of acquired product technology rights, primarily ENBREL, related to the Immunex acquisition. Amortization charges, net of tax, for the three years ended December 31, 2008 were $183 million, $185 million and $200 million, respectively. (5) As part of the accounting for the acquisitions of Alantos and Ilypsa in 2007, Avidia and Abgenix in 2006 and Tularik in 2004, we recorded charges to write-off acquired in-process R&D (“IPR&D”) of $270 million and $320 million in 2007, respectively, $130 million and $1.1 billion in 2006, respectively, and $554 million in 2004. These charges represent the estimated fair values of the IPR&D that, as of the respective acquisition dates, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. (6) In 2008, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, principally related to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech antitrust suit. In 2007, we recorded a loss accrual for an ongoing commercial legal proceeding and recorded an expense of $34 million. In 2005, we settled certain legal matters, primarily related to a patent legal proceeding, and recorded an expense of $49 million, net of amounts previously accrued. The remaining amounts included in “Other charges” in 2008 and 2007, primarily relate to restructuring charges (see Note 2, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). (7) In May 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2038 (the “2038 Notes”). (8) In 2008, we repaid our $2.0 billion of floating rate notes. (9) In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due in 2008, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2017 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2037. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of these notes were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under an accelerated share repurchase program (“ASR”) entered into in May 2007. (10) In February 2006, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 and $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013. In connection with the issuance of these notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also, concurrent with the issuance of these notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The cost of the convertible note hedges, which aggregated approximately $1.5 billion, was recorded as a reduction of equity. Also, concurrent with the issuance of these notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. (11) On March 2, 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their March 1, 2007 put option, we repurchased $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount, or the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes, at their then-accreted value for $1.7 billion in cash. (12) Throughout the five years ended December 31, 2008, we have had share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors through which we have repurchased $2.3 billion, $5.1 billion, $5.0 billion, $4.4 billion and $4.1 billion of Amgen common stock in 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 69 Table of Contents Item 7.

Risk Factors.” We have based our forward looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (“EPS”), liquidity and capital resources and trends. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Overview The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to assist the reader in understanding the business of Amgen. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We are a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. As a science-based, patient-focused organization, we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat grievous illness. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products include Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® and ENBREL all of which are sold in the United States. ENBREL is marketed under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth in the United States and Canada. Our international product sales consist principally of European sales of Aranesp® and Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®. For additional information about our principal products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see “Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates.” We operate in a highly regulated industry and various U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we conduct our business in those countries. Government authorities in the United States and in other countries regulate the manufacturing and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities. (See “Government Regulation.”) For example, prior to obtaining regulatory approval to market a product, we must conduct extensive clinical studies designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for use in humans in the indications sought. Furthermore, in order to maintain regulatory approval to market a product, we may be required to conduct further clinical trials and to provide additional information on safety and effectiveness. The regulatory environment is evolving and there is increased scrutiny on drug safety and increased authority being granted to regulatory bodies, in particular the FDA, to assist in ensuring the safety of therapeutic products, which may lead to fewer products being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies or 70 Table of Contents additional safety-related requirements. Safety signals, trends, adverse events or results from clinical trials, studies or meta-analyses performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators) or from the marketed use of our products may expand safety labeling, restrict the use for our approved products or may result in additional regulatory requirements, such as requiring risk management activities, including a REMS, and/or additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of PMCs or a pharmacovigilance program. (See “Item 1. Business — Key Developments” and “Item 1. Business — Postmarketing Safety Activities.”) Most patients receiving our products are covered by either government and/or private payor healthcare programs. The reimbursement environment is evolving with greater emphasis on cost containment. For example, we believe that the new U.S. presidential administration, together with Congress, will shape U.S. healthcare policy in the coming months and years, and we expect that healthcare reform efforts could include long-term changes to coverage and reimbursement that may have a significant impact on our business. Furthermore, due to the increasing expectations and demands of healthcare payors, we believe that we and others in our industry will be under increased pressure to further demonstrate the efficacy and economic value of our products. Therefore, sales of our products are and will continue to be affected by the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government and private insurance plans and administration of those programs. Governments may regulate access to, prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products and private insurers may be influenced by government reimbursement methodologies. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures. Further, safety signals, trends, adverse events or results from clinical trials, studies or meta-analyses or from the marketed use of our products may negatively impact worldwide reimbursement for our products. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see “Item 1. Business — Reimbursement.” For the year ended December 31, 2008, our total revenues were $15.0 billion and net income was $4.2 billion, or $3.90 per share on a diluted basis. In addition to the negative impact of the regulatory and reimbursement developments on sales of our ESA products, as discussed below, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 were negatively impacted by charges of $288 million for legal settlements and $148 million in connection with our previously announced restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2008, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $9.6 billion, of which approximately $8.8 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. If these funds were repatriated for use in the United States, we would be required to pay additional U.S. and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. Our total debt outstanding was $10.2 billion as of December 31, 2008, of which $1.0 billion is due in November 2009. Our cash flow from operations was $6.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our worldwide product sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $14.7 billion representing an increase of $376 million, or 3%, over product sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase reflects growth primarily in ENBREL and Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales significantly offset by a decline in U.S. Aranesp® sales. Product sales in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $11.5 billion and were relatively unchanged from 2007 as the decline in Aranesp® sales, in particular in the supportive cancer care setting, was offset by the overall growth in our other products. The decline in sales of Aranesp® reflects a decrease in demand resulting from various regulatory and reimbursement developments which principally occurred in the second half of 2007, additional product label changes in 2008 and, to a lesser extent, loss of segment share as discussed below. International product sales totaled $3.2 billion, reflecting an increase of 13% over 2007. International product sales comprised 22% of total product sales in 2008 compared to 20% in 2007 and consisted principally of European sales of Aranesp® and Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®. Growth in international product sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 was principally driven by favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes, which totaled $213 million for the year, and sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes for the year ended December 31, 2008, worldwide product sales increased 1% and international product sales increased 5%. 71 Table of Contents Beginning in late 2008 and continuing into 2009, foreign currency rates have also been experiencing extreme volatility. Changes in foreign currency rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales. However, the benefit or detriment of any resulting increases or decreases that movements in foreign currency exchange rates have on our international product sales are largely offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and as a result of our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to the Euro. As discussed in more detail in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” certain of our products, principally our marketed ESA products, have experienced a number of regulatory and reimbursement challenges, including safety-related revisions to product labels and the loss of or significant restrictions on reimbursement. The developments with respect to our marketed ESA products have had a material adverse impact on Aranesp® sales, in particular, in the U.S. supportive cancer care setting. Furthermore, our ESA products will continue to face future challenges. For example, in response to the FDA’s request, we have submitted a proposed REMS for the class of ESA products. We believe that a REMS program for our ESA products could have a material adverse impact on the future sales of Aranesp®, especially in the U.S. supportive cancer care setting. Additionally, future Aranesp® sales could also be materially adversely impacted by further changes in reimbursement, including as a result of future regulatory developments. In addition, certain of our marketed products are also under increased competitive pressures, including from biosimilar and other products in Europe, which compete or are expected to compete with Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®, as well as our marketed products in the United States, including ENBREL. In addition, capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption, particularly during the latter part of 2008 and the beginning of 2009. We are working to manage our business effectively despite the unprecedented conditions in the financial markets both in the United States and around the world. To date, these macro economic challenges have not affected us to a large degree. The extent and/or the duration of any potential adverse economic impact that such financial disruption may have on our third-party payors, including governments and private insurance plans, wholesale distributors, customers, service providers and suppliers is unclear. However, it may result in reduced demand for our products. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — The volatility of the current financial markets and the general economic slowdown may magnify certain risks that affect our business.”) As a result of the challenges facing certain of our products and, in particular, the regulatory and reimbursement developments involving our marketed ESA products that began in 2007 and their resulting impact on our operations, on August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant R&D investments and build the framework for our future growth. Key components of our restructuring plan initially included: (i) worldwide staff reductions aggregating approximately 2,500 positions, (ii) rationalization of our worldwide network of manufacturing facilities in order to gain cost efficiencies while continuing to meet future commercial and clinical demand for our products and product candidates and, to a lesser degree, changes to certain R&D capital projects and (iii) abandoning leases primarily for certain R&D facilities that will not be used in our operations. Through December 31, 2008, we have completed substantially all of the actions initially included in our restructuring plan, including the divestiture of certain less significant marketed products discussed below. During 2008, we identified certain additional initiatives designed to further assist in improving our cost structure, including outsourcing certain non-core business functions, most notably certain of our information systems’ infrastructure services, as well as abandoning leases for certain additional facilities that will no longer be used in our operations. The estimated cost of these additional initiatives is $95 million to $135 million. As a result of these additional initiatives and certain minor changes in the expected costs for the actions initially included in our restructuring plan, the total charges currently expected to be incurred in connection with our restructuring plan, including related implementation costs, has been increased to $950 million to $985 million, as compared to our prior estimate of $775 million to $825 million as of December 31, 2007. Through December 31, 2008 we have incurred $887 million of these costs and estimate that all remaining amounts will be incurred through 2009. Such cost estimates and amounts incurred are net of amounts recovered from our ENBREL co-promotion partner, Wyeth. 72 Table of Contents In September 2008, we entered into an agreement with Biovitrum whereby they acquired from us the marketed biologic therapeutic products Kepivance® (palifermin) and Stemgen® (ancestim), and also obtained from us a worldwide exclusive license to Kineret® (anakinra) for its current approved indication. In connection with the disposal of these less significant marketed products, we incurred a $10 million loss. For the year ended December 31, 2008, worldwide product sales for these marketed products were approximately $70 million. There are many factors that affect us and our industry in general, including, among others, those relating to increased complexity and cost of R&D due, in part, to greater scrutiny of clinical trials with respect to safety which may lead to fewer treatments being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies and/or safety-related label changes for approved products; increasingly intense competition for marketed products and product candidates; reimbursement changes; healthcare provider prescribing behavior, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; complex and expanding regulatory requirements; and intellectual property protection. (See “Item 1. Business” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information on these economic and industry-wide factors and their impact and potential impact on our business.) Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Aranesp® $ 3,137 (13 )% $ 3,614 (12 )% $ 4,121 EPOGEN® 2,456 (1 )% 2,489 (1 )% 2,511 Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® 4,659 9 % 4,277 9 % 3,923 ENBREL 3,598 11 % 3,230 12 % 2,879 Sensipar® 597 29 % 463 44 % 321 Other 240 1 % 238 131 % 103 Total product sales $ 14,687 3 % $ 14,311 3 % $ 13,858 Total U.S. $ 11,460 0 % $ 11,443 0 % $ 11,397 Total International 3,227 13 % 2,868 17 % 2,461 Total product sales $ 14,687 3 % $ 14,311 3 % $ 13,858 Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, government programs, regulatory developments or guidelines, clinical trial outcomes, clinical practice, contracting and pricing strategies, wholesaler and end-user inventory management practices, patient population growth, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, general economic conditions, new product launches and indications, competitive products, product supply and acquisitions. (See “Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates” for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) Total product sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 3%. This increase reflects growth primarily in ENBREL and Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales significantly offset by a decline in U.S. Aranesp® sales. Product sales in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $11.5 billion and were relatively unchanged from 2007 as the decline in Aranesp® sales was offset by the overall growth in other products. International product sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $3.2 billion reflecting an increase of 13% over 2007. International product sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflect favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes of $213 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes for the year ended December 31, 2008, total product sales increased 1% and international product sales increased 5%. 73 Table of Contents Aranesp® For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Aranesp® — U.S. $ 1,651 (23 )% $ 2,154 (23 )% $ 2,790 Aranesp® — International 1,486 2 % 1,460 10 % 1,331 Total Aranesp® $ 3,137 (13 )% $ 3,614 (12 )% $ 4,121 The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the negative impact on demand, primarily in the supportive cancer care setting, of physician conformance to regulatory and reimbursement developments which principally occurred in the second half of 2007, additional product label changes which occurred in 2008, and to a lesser extent, loss of segment share. The decline in demand was partially offset by an increase in the average net sales price. In addition, U.S. sales of Aranesp® for the year ended December 31, 2008 benefited from a slight change in an accounting estimate related to product sales return reserves. The regulatory and reimbursement developments negatively impacting sales, discussed in more detail in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” include (i) the loss of Aranesp® for use in the treatment of AoC in 2007 (ii) the March 9, 2007, November 8, 2007, March 7, 2008 and August 6, 2008 product safety-related label changes in the United States, and (iii) the CMS’ Decision Memorandum issued in July 2007, which significantly restricted Medicare reimbursement for use of Aranesp® in CIA and which we believe has also negatively impacted Aranesp® use in CIA for patients covered by private insurance plans. The increase in international Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 is due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which positively impacted sales growth by approximately $104 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international Aranesp® sales decreased 5%. This decrease reflects dosing conservatism in the oncology segment and pricing pressures across all ESAs in Europe, which has resulted in an overall decrease in the ESA market. Through December 31, 2008, biosimilars and other recently introduced marketed products in Europe have not had a significant impact on total international Aranesp® segment share. The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was principally driven by a decline in demand. This decline primarily reflects physician conformance to label and reimbursement changes that occurred throughout 2007, primarily in the supportive cancer care setting, which are discussed in more detail in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” and, to a lesser extent, loss of segment share. The increase in international Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily driven by favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes of $100 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international Aranesp® sales increased 2%. International sales were negatively impacted in Europe by dosing conservatism in the oncology segment and pricing pressures across all ESAs. In addition to the factors mentioned in the “Product sales” section above, future worldwide Aranesp® sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: • regulatory developments, including those resulting from: ¡ the proposed REMS for the class of ESAs, which we have submitted to the FDA, or other risk management activities undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; ¡ product labeling changes occurring in October 2008 in Europe for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp®, by the European Commission and the potential for further changes; ¡ future product label changes; • reimbursement developments, including those resulting from: ¡ government’s and/or third-party payor’s reaction to regulatory developments, including the proposed REMS, which we have submitted to the FDA, and recent or future product label changes; 74 Table of Contents ¡ current or future cost containment pressures by third-party payors, including governments and private insurance plans; • adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies or meta-analyses performed by us, including our pharmacovigilance clinical trials, or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), such as those referred to in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” which have and could further impact product safety labeling, negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our product; • our ability to maintain worldwide segment share and differentiate Aranesp® from current and potential future competitive products, including J&J’s Epoetin alfa product marketed in the United States and certain other locations outside of the United States and other competitors’ products outside of the United States, including biosimilar products that have been or are expected to be launched in the future; • our current and future contracting and related pricing strategies; • patient population growth; and • development of new treatments for cancer and future chemotherapy treatments. For example, targeted therapies and other treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less Aranesp®. Certain of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp®. See “Item 1. Business — Key Developments” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” herein for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. EPOGEN® For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 EPOGEN® — U.S. $ 2,456 (1 )% $ 2,489 (1 )% $ 2,511 The 1% decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in demand, reflecting a decline in the average net sales price. The increase in demand resulting from patient population growth was offset by a decline in dose/utilization in certain settings. The decline in dose/utilization is related to the ESA label changes and the CMS revision to its EMP, which became effective January 1, 2008, as discussed in more detail in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments.” We believe that the EMP implementation significantly impacted physician behavior resulting in declines in dosing trends, as particularly noted in the quarter of implementation. However, this dose decline subsequently moderated throughout 2008. The decline in EPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects a decrease in demand due to a decline in dose/utilization, partially offset by patient population growth. The decline in dose/utilization was due to physician behavior in making treatment and dosing decisions in response to regulatory and reimbursement developments that occurred throughout 2007, including anticipation of the implementation of the CMS revision to its EMP, as discussed in more detail in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments.” The decline in sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was partially offset by favorable changes in wholesaler inventory and spillover. Spillover is a result of the Company’s contractual relationship with J&J (see Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies — Product sales” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). In addition to the factors mentioned in the “Product sales” section above, future EPOGEN® sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: • reimbursement developments, including those resulting from: ¡ changes in healthcare providers’ prescribing behavior resulting in dose fluctuations due to the CMS’ revisions to its EMP, which became effective January 1, 2008; 75 Table of Contents ¡ the federal government’s reaction to regulatory developments, including recent or future product label changes; ¡ changes in reimbursement rates or changes in the basis for reimbursement by the federal and state governments, including Medicare and Medicaid; ¡ cost containment pressures from the federal and state governments on healthcare providers; • regulatory developments, including those resulting from: ¡ future product label changes; ¡ risk management activities, including a REMS, undertaken by us or required by the FDA; • governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products, including changes in medical guidelines and legislative actions; • adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies or meta-analyses performed by us, including our pharmacovigilance clinical trials, or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), such as those referred to in “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” which have and could further impact product safety labeling, negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • our current and future contracting and related pricing strategies; • changes in future patient population growth or dose/utilization; and • development of new modalities to treat anemia associated with CRF. See “Item 1. Business — Key Developments” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Neulasta® — U.S. $ 2,505 7 % $ 2,351 6 % $ 2,217 NEUPOGEN® — U.S. 896 4 % 861 4 % 830 U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total 3,401 6 % 3,212 5 % 3,047 Neulasta® — International 813 25 % 649 32 % 493 NEUPOGEN® — International 445 7 % 416 9 % 383 International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total 1,258 18 % 1,065 22 % 876 Total Worldwide Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® $ 4,659 9 % $ 4,277 9 % $ 3,923 The increase in U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily reflects an increase in demand for Neulasta® driven by an increase in the average net sales price partially offset by a slight decline in units sold. The increase in international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects increased demand driven by continued conversion from NEUPOGEN® to Neulasta® as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which positively impacted the growth in combined international sales by $86 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales increased 10% versus the prior year. The increase in U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was driven by demand for Neulasta® primarily due to segment growth and, to a lesser degree, favorable changes in wholesaler inventory levels. The increase in international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 76 Table of Contents 2007 was driven by the continued conversion to Neulasta® from NEUPOGEN® and changes in foreign exchange, which positively impacted the growth in combined international sales by $74 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, combined international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales increased 13%. In addition to the factors mentioned in the “Product sales” section above, future worldwide Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: • penetration of existing segments; • competitive products or therapies, including biosimilar products that have been or may be approved and launched in the EU (see “Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates” for additional discussion); • the availability, extent and access to reimbursement by government and third-party payors; • adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies or meta-analyses performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could impact product safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our products, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; • cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; • our current and future contracting and related pricing strategies; • patient population growth; and • development of new treatments for cancer and future chemotherapy treatments. For example, targeted therapies and other treatments that are less myelosuppressive, and changes in chemotherapy usage patterns, may require less Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®. See “Item 1. Business — Key Developments” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. ENBREL For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 ENBREL — U.S. $ 3,389 11 % $ 3,052 12 % $ 2,736 ENBREL — International 209 17 % 178 24 % 143 Total ENBREL $ 3,598 11 % $ 3,230 12 % $ 2,879 ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects higher demand principally due to increases in average net sales price. ENBREL sales were also favorably impacted by approximately $100 million due to a change in our distribution model for ENBREL. Previously, ENBREL was shipped directly to pharmacies. However, beginning in the three months ended March 31, 2008, we commenced using a wholesaler distributor model, similar to our other marketed products. Also, ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2008 was affected by share declines in the rheumatology and dermatology segments in the United States compared to the prior year due to increased competitive activity. However, sales growth continued in both rheumatology and dermatology, and ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both segments. ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2007 was driven by demand due to increases in both patients and average net sales price. While ENBREL continued to maintain a leading position in both rheumatology and dermatology, the sales growth during the year ended December 31, 2007 was affected by slight share declines in the United States in both segments compared to the prior year due to increased competitive activity. 77 Table of Contents In addition to the factors mentioned in the “Product sales” section above, future worldwide ENBREL sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: • the effects of competing products or therapies, including new competitive products coming to market, such as J&J’s CNTO 1275 (ustekinumab) and CNTO 148 (golimumab) (see “Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates”) and, in part, our ability to differentiate ENBREL based on its safety profile and efficacy; • recent or future product label changes; • risk management activities, including a REMS, undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; • growth in the rheumatology and dermatology segments; • the availability, extent and access to reimbursement by government and third-party payors; • adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies or meta-analyses performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could impact product safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our product; • cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; • current and future contracting and related pricing strategies; • patient population growth; and • penetration of existing segments. See “Item 1. Business — Key Developments” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes our product sales and operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (dollar amounts in millions): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Product sales $ 14,687 3% $ 14,311 3% $ 13,858 Operating expenses: Cost of sales (excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets) $ 2,296 (10)% $ 2,548 22% $ 2,095 % of product sales 16% 18% 15% Research and development $ 3,030 (7)% $ 3,266 (3)% $ 3,366 % of product sales 21% 23% 24% Selling, general and administrative $ 3,789 13% $ 3,361 0% $ 3,366 % of product sales 26% 23% 24% Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 294 $ 298 $ 370 Write-off of acquired in-process research and development $ — $ 590 $ 1,231 Other charges $ 380 $ 728 $ — Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets, decreased 10% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by lower restructuring charges incurred in 2008, as 78 Table of Contents discussed below. In addition, the decline in cost of sales was due to lower inventory write-offs and lower cost ENBREL, partially offset by higher sales volume and excess capacity charges. Cost of sales increased 22% for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily driven by restructuring charges, as discussed below, product mix due to higher sales of ENBREL, excess capacity charges and the write-off of excess inventory related to certain new product presentations and due to changing regulatory and reimbursement environments. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $6 million of restructuring charges. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $150 million of restructuring charges, primarily related to accelerated depreciation resulting from the decision to accelerate closure of one of our ENBREL commercial bulk manufacturing operations in connection with the rationalization of our worldwide network of manufacturing facilities. See Note 2, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Research and development R&D costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems’ costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses include costs incurred under R&D arrangements with our corporate partners, such as activities performed on behalf of KA, and costs associated with collaborative R&D and in-licensing arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to collaboration partners in connection with technologies that have no alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&D costs for R&D collaborations are recognized as the obligation has been incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. R&D expenses decreased 7% for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was principally due to $102 million of lower staff-related costs and discretionary expenses; $133 million of lower clinical trial costs; $100 million of cost recoveries derived from our licensing agreements, primarily with Daiichi Sankyo and Takeda and a $16 million decline in restructuring-related costs, as discussed below, partially offset by a $100 million expense in the year ended December 31, 2008 for the upfront payment under our licensing agreement with Kyowa Hakko. Our clinical trial costs were lower for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the completion of enrollment of our large denosumab clinical trials and the related significant costs associated with site initiation and patient enrollment no longer being incurred, partially offset by increased clinical costs for our emerging pipeline. R&D expenses decreased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was primarily attributable to reductions in in-licensing expenses of approximately $95 million primarily due to our agreement with Cytokinetics entered into in 2006 and a $50 million benefit in 2007 from our licensing agreement with Daiichi Sankyo. These decreases in R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were partially offset by $19 million of restructuring costs, as discussed below. For the year ended December 31, 2008, restructuring-related R&D costs totaled $3 million. R&D expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 include $19 million of restructuring costs, primarily comprised of $38 million in charges related to asset impairments offset by a $19 million benefit associated with the reversal of previously accrued expenses for bonuses and stock-based compensation awards, which were forfeited as a result of the employees’ termination. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses are primarily comprised of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. In connection with a co-promotion agreement, we and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada and Wyeth is paid a share of the related profits, as defined. The share of ENBREL’s profits owed to Wyeth is included in SG&A expenses. 79 Table of Contents SG&A expense increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, in part due to the impact of our restructuring plan which contributed $161 million to the increase in expenses, as discussed below. The increase was also due to higher expense associated with the Wyeth profit share of $211 million, product promotional spending of $39 million and staff-related costs of $94 million, partially offset by lower litigation expense of $50 million. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the expense associated with the Wyeth profit share, excluding recoveries recorded as part of our restructuring, as discussed below, was $1,195 million and $984 million, respectively. SG&A remained relatively unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, outside legal costs increased $53 million and outside marketing costs increased approximately $59 million. The increase in outside marketing is primarily due to an increase in the expense associated with the Wyeth profit share, partially offset by reductions in promotion and advertising on marketed products. These increases were offset by approximately $125 million in expense recoveries associated with our restructuring, as discussed below. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the expense associated with the Wyeth profit share was $837 million. See Note 2, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $37 million for certain restructuring charges, which primarily included $17 million in asset impairments, $12 million in loss accruals for leases principally related to certain facilities that will not be used in our business and $9 million in implementation costs associated with certain restructuring initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $114 million in cost recoveries for certain restructuring charges, principally with respect to accelerated depreciation, in connection with our co-promotion agreement with Wyeth and $11 million of benefit associated with the reversal of previously accrued expenses for bonuses and stock-based compensation awards, which were forfeited as a result of the employees’ termination. See Note 2, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Amortization of acquired intangible assets Amortization of acquired intangible assets relates to products technology rights acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, amortization expense also included $3 million and $49 million, respectively, related to the impairment of a non-ENBREL related intangible asset previously acquired in the Immunex acquisition. Write-off of acquired in-process research and development For acquisitions prior to January 1, 2009, the fair value of acquired IPR&D projects, which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition, were immediately expensed (see “Recent accounting pronouncements” below). In 2007, we wrote-off $270 million and $320 million of acquired IPR&D related to the acquisitions of Alantos and Ilypsa, respectively. The Alantos IPR&D amount is related to an orally administered treatment for type II diabetes that, at the date of acquisition, was in phase 2a clinical trials. The Ilypsa IPR&D amount is related to a phosphate binder that, at the date of acquisition, was in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on hemodialysis. In 2006, we wrote-off $1.1 billion and $130 million of acquired IPR&D related to the acquisitions of Abgenix and Avidia, respectively. The Abgenix IPR&D amount is primarily comprised of approximately $770 million related to the rights which we did not own pursuant to our agreement with Abgenix to jointly develop and commercialize panitumumab and approximately $330 million related to a royalty that we would have owed to Abgenix with respect to future sales of denosumab as a result of using certain of Abgenix’s patented technologies in the development of this product candidate. Panitumumab was Abgenix’s fully human monoclonal antibody which, at acquisition, was in phase 2/3 clinical trials for the treatment of certain types of cancer. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is a key mediator of osteoclast formation, function and survival and was in phase 2/3 clinical trials for various types of bone diseases at the time of the Abgenix acquisition. There were no individually significant IPR&D projects acquired and written off in the acquisition of Avidia. 80 Table of Contents We used the “income method” to determine the estimated fair values of acquired IPR&D, which uses a discounted cash flow model and applies a probability weighting based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimated future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs. These success rates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates. These cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 10%. The estimated after-tax cash flows were probability weighted at success rates of 38% for the Alantos product candidate, 77% for the Ilypsa product candidate, and 43% to 85% for the Abgenix product candidates. The incremental R&D expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approval for the Alantos and Ilypsa product candidates are immaterial. The incremental R&D expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the various indications of panitumumab were estimated at the time of acquisition at approximately $300 million and would be incurred through 2011. The elimination of the royalty on potential future sales of denosumab did not result in us incurring any incremental R&D expenses. The above assumptions were used solely for the purposes of estimating fair values of these product candidates as of the date of their acquisition. However, we cannot provide assurance that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization will materialize, as estimated. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization of these product candidates are our ability to confirm their safety and efficacy based on data from clinical trials, our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and our ability to successfully complete these tasks within budgeted costs. We are not able to market a human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D may vary from its estimated value at the date of acquisition. At the date of acquisition, we intended to develop panitumumab for treatment of various types of cancer. Panitumumab received FDA approval in late September 2006 for the treatment of mCRC after disease progression on, or following, fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens and is marketed under the trademark Vectibix®. In December 2007, the European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorization for Vectibix® as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing mCRC with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS genes after failure of standard chemotherapy regimens. This conditional approval is reviewed annually by the CHMP, and in December 2008 we agreed as a condition of the renewal of approval to conduct an additional clinical trial in the existing approved indication. We are continuing to develop or are evaluating plans to develop Vectibix® in all of the remaining indications we had intended at the date of acquisition. However, since the acquisition, there have been several events that have affected the development plans for Vectibix®, such as the results of our PACCE trial and KRAS biomarker analysis. Because of these developments, our expected time to obtain regulatory approvals for the remaining indications has been delayed compared to our original expectations. Our development efforts with respect to denosumab are continuing. In December 2008, we submitted a BLA to the FDA for denosumab for the treatment and prevention of PMO in women and bone loss in patients undergoing hormone ablation for either prostate or breast cancer. On February 18, 2009, the FDA accepted our BLA and informed us that it will target an FDA action within ten months of the BLA’s submission date. Additionally, in January 2009, we submitted an application to the EMEA for the approval of denosumab for treatment of PMO in women and treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation therapy in patients with breast and prostate cancer. In addition, we are continuing to develop the product candidate acquired in the Alantos acquisition. We have reviewed data from recently-completed phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for AMG 223, the product candidate acquired in the Ilypsa acquisition. The results were consistent with what is likely required for registration of a phosphate-binding therapy. However, in the context of our overall development portfolio, the Company will be reviewing other options for the commercialization of this investigational product. Other charges As discussed in Note 2, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing 81 Table of Contents to make significant R&D investments and build the framework for our future growth. As a result of this restructuring plan, we recorded in “Other charges” in 2008 and 2007 expenses for staff separation costs of $7 million and $209 million, respectively, asset impairments of $36 million and $366 million, respectively, and charges of $49 million and $119 million, respectively, primarily related to the loss accruals for leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our business. Also, in 2008, the Company recorded in “Other charges” loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, principally related to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech antitrust suit. In addition, in 2007, the Company recorded a $34 million loss accrual for an ongoing commercial legal proceeding. Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 20.1%, 20.1% and 26.6% for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2008 remained relatively unchanged from 2007. Although the 2007 effective tax rate benefited from the favorable resolution of certain income tax examinations, this benefit was substantially offset by the write-off of nondeductible acquired IPR&D costs, resulting in a comparable effective tax rate between the two years. Our effective tax rate for 2007 decreased over 2006 primarily due to the lesser amount of the write-off of nondeductible acquired IPR&D costs in 2007 than in 2006 and the greater tax benefit from the favorable resolutions of our prior years’ income tax examinations in 2007 than in 2006. As permitted in Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes — Special Areas,” we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. (See Note 5, “Income taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Recent accounting pronouncements In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)” (“FSP APB 14-1”) that changes the method of accounting for convertible debt securities that require or permit settlement in cash either in whole or in part upon conversion, including our convertible debt securities (see Note 6, “Financing arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We will adopt FSP APB 14-1, effective January 1, 2009, and retrospectively apply this change in accounting to all prior periods presented for which we had applicable outstanding convertible debt, as required by this new standard. Under this new method of accounting, the debt and equity components of our convertible debt securities will be bifurcated and accounted for separately in a manner that will result in recognizing interest expense on these securities at effective rates reflective of what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms. The equity component of our convertible debt securities will be included in “Stockholders’ equity” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and, accordingly, the initial carrying values of these debt securities will be reduced. Our net income for financial reporting purposes will be reduced by recognizing the accretion of the reduced carrying values of our convertible debt securities to their face amounts as additional non-cash interest expense. The adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will result in a reduction in the carrying value of our convertible debt by approximately $824 million as of December 31, 2008 and will increase interest expense, net by approximately $234 million, $168 million and $197 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This new standard will also materially increase interest expense in future periods that our convertible debt is outstanding, but will have no impact on past or future cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141(R)”) and SFAS No. 160, “Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51” (“SFAS 160”). These standards will significantly change the accounting and reporting for business combination transactions and noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements, including capitalizing the fair value of acquired IPR&D at the acquisition date and subsequently testing these assets for impairment. These new standards will be applied prospectively for business combinations 82 Table of Contents that occur on or after January 1, 2009, except that presentation and disclosure requirements of SFAS 160 regarding noncontrolling interests will be applied retrospectively. In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-5, “Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock” (“EITF 07-5”). Equity-linked instruments (or embedded features) that otherwise meet the definition of a derivative as outlined in SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” are not accounted for as derivatives if certain criteria are met, one of which is that the instrument (or embedded feature) must be indexed to the entity’s own stock. EITF 07-5 provides guidance on how to determine if equity-linked instruments (or embedded features) such as warrants to purchase our stock, our convertible notes and convertible note hedges are considered indexed to our stock. We will adopt EITF 07-5, effective January 1, 2009, and apply its provisions to outstanding instruments as of that date. The adoption of EITF 07-5 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB ratified EITF No. 07-1, “Accounting for Collaborative Agreements” (“EITF 07-1”). EITF 07-1 provides guidance regarding financial statement presentation and disclosure of collaborative arrangements, as defined, which includes certain arrangements the Company has entered into regarding development and commercialization of products and product candidates. EITF 07-1 is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2009, and its adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data (in millions): December 31, 2008 2007 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 9,552 $ 7,151 Total assets 36,443 34,639 Current debt 1,000 2,000 Non-current debt 9,176 9,177 Stockholders’ equity 20,386 17,869 We believe that existing funds, including those generated from our $2.0 billion debt offering in January 2009, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to opportunistically pursue our stock repurchase programs and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities. Our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including: cash provided by operating activities, sale of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and other debt markets and equity markets. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented and adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective sources of funding and our investment in marketable securities may be subject to market, interest and credit risk that could reduce their value.”) Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2008, approximately $8.8 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. If these funds were repatriated for use in the United States, we would be required to pay additional U.S. and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. The primary objectives for our marketable security investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return, consistent with these two objectives. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. 83 Table of Contents Financing arrangements The following table reflects the carrying value of our long-term borrowings under our various financing arrangements as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 (in millions): 2008 2007 0.125% convertible notes due 2011 (2011 Convertible Notes) $ 2,500 $ 2,500 0.375% convertible notes due 2013 (2013 Convertible Notes) 2,500 2,500 Floating rate notes due 2008 (2008 Floating Rate Notes) — 2,000 5.85% notes due 2017 (2017 Notes) 1,099 1,099 4.85% notes due 2014 (2014 Notes) 1,000 1,000 4.00% notes due 2009 (2009 Notes) 1,000 999 6.375% notes due 2037 (2037 Notes) 899 899 6.15% notes due 2018 (2018 Notes) 499 — 6.90% notes due 2038 (2038 Notes) 498 — Zero coupon 30 year modified convertible notes due in 2032 (2032 Modified Convertible Notes) 81 80 Other 100 100 Total borrowings 10,176 11,177 Less current portion 1,000 2,000 Total non-current debt $ 9,176 $ 9,177 In May 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2038 (the “2038 Notes”) in a registered offering. The 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 6.15% and 6.90%, respectively. The 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes may be redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest and a “make-whole” amount, as defined. In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a portion of the 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs totaled approximately $6 million and are being amortized over the life of the notes. In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due in November 2008 (the “2008 Floating Rate Notes”), $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2017 (the “2017 Notes”) and $900 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2037 (the “2037 Notes”). The annual interest rate on our 2008 Floating Rate Notes was equal to LIBOR plus 0.08%, which was reset quarterly. The 2017 Notes and 2037 Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 5.85% and 6.375%, respectively. The 2017 Notes and 2037 Notes may be redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest and a “make-whole” amount, as defined. In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a portion of the 2017 Notes and 2037 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of these notes were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under an ASR entered into in May 2007. Upon the receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes discussed above, in June 2008 we exercised our right to call and retired $1.0 billion of the 2008 Floating Rate Notes which were scheduled to mature in November 2008. The remaining $1.0 billion of the 2008 Floating Rate Notes matured and were retired in November 2008. In February 2006, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the “2011 Convertible Notes”) and $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the “2013 Convertible Notes”). The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.125% and 0.375%, respectively. The 2011 Convertible Notes and 2013 Convertible Notes may be converted based on an initial conversion rate of 12.5247 shares and 12.5814 shares, respectively, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $79.84 and $79.48 per share, respectively). The 2011 Convertible Notes and 2013 Convertible Notes may only be converted (i) during any 84 Table of Contents calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the respective conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous quarter, (ii) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur or (iii) one month prior to the respective maturity date. Upon conversion, a holder would receive (i) cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value, as defined, and (ii) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, shares of our common stock, cash or a combination of common stock and cash, at our option (the “excess conversion value”). In addition, upon a change in control, as defined, the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes for 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. See “Recent accounting pronouncements” above. In connection with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and 2013 Convertible Notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also, concurrent with the issuance of these convertible notes, we purchased convertible note hedges. The convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash from the counterparties to the transactions equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would issue and/or pay to the holders of the 2011 Convertible Notes and 2013 Convertible Notes upon conversion. These transactions will terminate at the earlier of the maturity dates of the related notes or the first day none of the related notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. The cost of the convertible note hedges, which aggregated approximately $1.5 billion, was recorded as a reduction of equity. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and 2013 Convertible Notes, the repurchase of our common stock and the purchase of the convertible note hedges was $439 million. Also, concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and 2013 Convertible Notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $107.90 per share. Pursuant to these transactions, warrants for approximately 31.3 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2011 and warrants for approximately 31.5 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2013 (the “settlement dates”). If the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be net settled, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. As of December 31, 2008, we had $2.2 billion of additional notes outstanding. The notes consisted of (i) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% and mature in November of 2009 (“2009 Notes”), (ii) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.85% and mature in 2014 (“2014 Notes”), (iii) $100 million of long-term debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.125% and mature in 2097 (“Century Notes”) and (iv) zero coupon convertible notes due in 2032 with an accreted value of $81 million and having an aggregate face amount of $105 million and yield to maturity of 1.125%. See “Recent accounting pronouncements” above. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a LIBOR-based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap agreements qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2008, we had interest rate swap agreements for our 2009 Notes, 2014 Notes, 2018 Notes and Century Notes, with an aggregate face value of $2.6 billion. As of December 31, 2007, we had interest rate swap agreements for our 2009 Notes, 2014 Notes and Century Notes, with an aggregate face value of $2.1 billion. In addition to the outstanding debt noted above, in January 2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2039 (the “2039 Notes”) in a registered offering. The 2019 Notes and 2039 Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 5.70% and 6.40%, respectively. The 2019 Notes and 2039 Notes may be redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest and a “make-whole” amount, as defined. In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a portion of the 2019 Notes and 2039 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs totaled approximately $12 million and are being amortized over the life of the notes. 85 Table of Contents On April 17, 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which replaced our previous $1.0 billion shelf registration statement and allows us to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units and depository shares. Under this registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. In May 2008, we increased our commercial paper program by $1.3 billion, which provides for unsecured, short-term borrowings of up to an aggregate of $2.5 billion. We also have a $2.5 billion syndicated unsecured revolving credit facility which matures in November 2012 and is available for general corporate purposes, or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program; however, $178 million of such commitment was provided by a subsidiary of Lehman. Lehman declared bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, and the subsidiary participant in our credit facility subsequently declared bankruptcy on October 5, 2008. As a result, we would not anticipate the ability to access this specific commitment provided by Lehman in the future. No amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program or credit facility as of December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we have $400 million remaining under a shelf registration statement that was established in 1997. In connection with this shelf registration, we established a $400 million medium-term note program. All of the $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2008, no securities were outstanding under the $400 million medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2008. None of our financing arrangements contain any financial covenants. Our outstanding convertible notes and other outstanding long-term debt are rated “A+” with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s, “A3” with a stable outlook by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and “A” with a stable outlook by Fitch, Inc. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,988 $ 5,401 $ 5,389 Net cash used in investing activities (3,165 ) (1,992 ) (5,131 ) Net cash used in financing activities (3,073 ) (2,668 ) (815 ) Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2008 primarily as a result of improvement in operating income. Cash provided by operating activities remained relatively unchanged in 2007 as higher cash receipts from customers were substantially offset by the timing of payments in the ordinary course of business. Investing Net purchases of marketable securities were $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to net purchases of $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and net purchases of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. Capital expenditures totaled $672 million in 2008 and were significantly lower compared to $1.3 billion in 2007 and $1.2 billion in 2006 as we reassessed our capital spending needs. Capital expenditures in 2008 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico, Fremont and other site developments and 86 Table of Contents investment in our global ERP system and other information systems’ projects. Capital expenditures in 2007 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity and site expansions in Puerto Rico and other locations and investment in our global ERP system. Capital expenditures in 2006 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity and site expansions in Ireland, Puerto Rico and other locations and costs associated with implementing our ERP system. We currently estimate 2009 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million. On January 4, 2008, we completed our acquisition of Dompé and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $56 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $2 million. On July 18, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Ilypsa and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $398 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $2 million. On July 16, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Alantos and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $299 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $1 million. On October 24, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Avidia and paid $275 million in cash, net of cash acquired and our existing equity stake in Avidia. In addition, we may be subject to pay additional amounts upon the achievement of certain future events. On April 1, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Abgenix and paid $2.1 billion in cash to the shareholders of Abgenix to acquire all outstanding shares. In addition, we acquired $252 million in cash, and subsequent to the completion of the acquisition, we paid off $653 million of debt assumed in this transaction. Financing In July 2007, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of common stock. As of December 31, 2008, we had $4.2 billion available for stock repurchases as authorized by our Board of Directors. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors, including the stock price, blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and our credit rating and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. A summary of our repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is as follows (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars First quarter — $ — 8.8 $ 537 46.6 $ 3,374 Second quarter 32.7 1,549 (1) 73.9 (2) 4,463 13.0 876 Third quarter — 19 (1) 2.5 (2) — 7.3 505 Fourth quarter 12.6 700 1.8 100 3.3 245 Total 45.3 $ 2,268 87.0 $ 5,100 70.2 $ 5,000 (1) The total cost of shares repurchased during the three months ended June 30, 2008 excludes approximately $19 million paid in July 2008 in connection with the final settlement of an ASR entered into in May 2008. (2) The total number of shares repurchased during the three months ended June 30, 2007 excludes 2.5 million shares received in July 2007 in connection with the final settlement of an ASR entered into in May 2007. As discussed above, in May 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2018 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2038 resulting in net proceeds received of $991 million. In June 2008, upon receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of these notes, we exercised our right to call and retired $1.0 billion of floating rate notes scheduled to mature in November 2008 and in November 2008, we retired the remaining $1.0 billion of floating rate notes that matured. 87 Table of Contents In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2008 Floating Rate Notes, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.85% notes due in 2017 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% notes due in 2037, resulting in net proceeds of $4.0 billion. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of these notes were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under an ASR entered into in May 2007. On March 2, 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their March 1, 2007 put option, we repurchased $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount, or the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1.7 billion in cash. In addition $135 million of other debt securities matured and were repaid in 2007. In February 2006, we issued $5.0 billion of convertible notes, of which $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.125% and are due in 2011 and $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.375% and are due in 2013. In connection with the issuance of these convertible notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also, concurrent with the issuance of these convertible notes, we purchased convertible note hedges at a cost of approximately $1.5 billion. The net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2011 and 2013 Convertible Notes, the repurchase of common stock and the purchase of the convertible note hedges was $439 million. Also, concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes, we sold 62.8 million warrants to acquire shares of our common stock for proceeds of $774 million, 31.3 million of which may be settled in May 2011 and 31.5 million of which may be settled in May 2013. We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options. Employee stock option exercises provided $155 million, $277 million and $528 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 2-3Years 4-5Years More than5 Years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 14,277 $ 1,236 $ 2,914 $ 3,022 $ 7,105 Operating lease obligations 1,064 126 222 186 530 Purchase obligations(2) 2,959 850 1,012 409 688 Unrecognized tax benefits(3) 120 120 — — — Total contractual obligations $ 18,420 $ 2,332 $ 4,148 $ 3,617 $ 8,323 (1) The long-term debt obligation amounts include future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on the 2009 Notes at a fixed rate of 4.00%, the 2011 Convertible Notes at a fixed rate of 0.125%, the 2013 Convertible Notes at a fixed rate of 0.375%, the 2014 Notes at a fixed rate of 4.85%, the 2017 Notes at a fixed rate of 5.85%, the 2018 Notes at a fixed rate of 6.15%, the 2037 Notes at a fixed rate of 6.375%, the 88 Table of Contents 2038 Notes at a fixed rate of 6.90% and the Century Notes at a fixed rate of 8.125%. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements. These interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a LIBOR-based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2008 to compute the net amounts to be included in the table above for future interest payments on our variable rate interest rate swaps. (2) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (i) our long-term supply agreement with BI Pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for ENBREL and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved; (ii) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business and (v) our agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”), which we entered into on October 22, 2008, for certain information systems’ infrastructure services. The term of the agreement is five years with three one-year renewals, at our option, for a total of up to eight years. The cost to us for the initial five-year term, included in the table above, is estimated to be $505 million. The estimated aggregate additional cost of the three one-year renewal options not included in the table above is approximately $254 million. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. (3) In addition to the current liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (“UTBs”) included in the table above, long-term liabilities for UTBs (net of federal tax benefits on state taxes) and related accrued interest totaling approximately $915 million at December 31, 2008 are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. On February 4, 2009, we entered into an agreement for certain integrated facilities management services. The contract has an initial term of five years and automatically renews annually thereafter at the Company’s option. The cost to the Company for the initial five-year term is estimated to be approximately $500 million. The contractual obligations under this contract are not included in the table above given the timing of entering into the agreement. In addition to the above table, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third-parties as part of in-licensing and product development programs all of which are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events. Such events could include, but are not limited to, development milestones, regulatory approvals and product sales. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been included in the table above or recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one reporting period. However, if the achievement of the milestones covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the resulting payment obligation would be approximately $1.3 billion. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales, sales incentives and returns Sales of our products are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other incentives (collectively “sales incentives”) and returns. 89 Table of Contents In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell outside the United States are principally distributed to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third-party data and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns. Accruals for sales incentives are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales. Sales incentive accruals are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales incentives are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives were comprised of the following (dollar amounts in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Rebates $ 1,813 $ 2,156 $ 2,164 Wholesaler chargebacks 1,635 1,649 1,636 Discounts and other incentives 790 694 653 Total sales incentives $ 4,238 $ 4,499 $ 4,453 Percent of gross product sales 22% 24% 24% Rebates earned by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers and hospitals in the United States may include performance-based offers, such as attaining contractually-specified segment share or other performance-based measures. As a result, the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. These rebates totaled $1.8 billion in 2008, $2.2 billion in 2007 and $2.2 billion in 2006. We believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on our recent experience, changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than 3.5% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for such periods. These changes in annual estimates substantially relate to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period. A 3.5% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2008 would have had an impact of approximately $63 million on our 2008 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in “sales incentives” that relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers. These chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $1.6 billion for each of the three years ended December 31, 2008. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability. 90 Table of Contents Amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. However, such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives (in millions): Balance atBeginning ofPeriod Amounts ChargedAgainst ProductSales(1) Payments Balance atEnd ofPeriod Year ended: December 31, 2008 $ 1,064 $ 4,238 $ 4,426 $ 876 December 31, 2007 $ 1,079 $ 4,499 $ 4,514 $ 1,064 (1) Includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates. Such amounts represented less than 2% of incentive amounts charged against product sales for 2008 and 2007. Accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales. Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have been insignificant, amounting to less than 1% of gross product sales. Furthermore, changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant. Deferred income taxes Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable U.S. and state marginal income tax rates which could materially impact our future effective tax rate. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 10, “Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. In addition, our income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and various state and foreign tax authorities. Significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items, one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of acquired intangible assets We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets primarily by acquiring biotechnology companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in-process product candidates as well as goodwill arising in business combinations. Discounted cash flow 91 Table of Contents models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: • determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in-process projects, • projecting regulatory approvals, • estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects and • developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. Fair value measurement of financial instruments The Company adopted the provisions of the FASB’s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), effective January 1, 2008, for its financial assets and liabilities. Under this standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities, the Company uses various valuation approaches. SFAS 157 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The availability of observable inputs can vary among the various types of financial assets and liabilities. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Whenever the estimated fair value of any of our available-for-sale securities is less than their related cost, we perform an impairment analysis in accordance with the FASB’s SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and related guidance issued by the FASB and the SEC, in order to determine the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-temporary”. A temporary impairment results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of stockholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not affect net income for the applicable accounting period. However, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of income and reduces net income for the applicable accounting period. The primary factors we consider to differentiate our impairments between temporary and other-than-temporary impairments include the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. As of December 31, 2008, the Company’s available-for-sale securities were comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of U.S. government agencies, FDIC guaranteed bank debt, corporate debt securities, mortgage and asset backed securities, other short-term interest bearing securities, including money market funds, and publicly traded equity investments. U.S. Treasury securities, money market funds and publicly traded equity investments are valued using quoted market prices with no valuation adjustments applied. Obligations of U.S. government agencies, FDIC guaranteed bank debt, corporate debt securities, mortgage and asset backed securities and other short-term interest bearing securities are valued using quoted market prices of recent transactions or are benchmarked to transactions of very similar securities. 92 Table of Contents Our derivatives assets and liabilities include interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward and option contracts. The fair values of these derivatives are determined using models based on market observable inputs, including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. We believe that the values assigned to our available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 are fairly stated in accordance with GAAP and are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions. In addition, we believe that the cost basis for our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was recoverable in all material respects. In 2008, the U.S. economy continued to be adversely affected by tightening in the credit markets and volatility in capital markets. Interest rates on U.S. treasury instruments declined considerably during this crisis while other interest rates fluctuated in excess of historical norms. In addition, the U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically over the second half of the year against most other currencies during a period of extremely high levels of currency volatility. Continuing distress in the economic environment could ultimately result in other-than-temporary impairments of the carrying values of our available-for-sale securities and/or a material adverse impact on the carrying values of our financial instruments. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a global biotechnology company with operations in various countries. We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits, requiring letters of credit and obtaining credit insurance, as we deem appropriate. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments, primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer. We also enter into various types of foreign exchange and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives. In 2008, the U.S. economy continued to be adversely affected by a tightening in the credit markets and volatility in the capital markets. In an attempt to increase liquidity and stabilize the global financial markets, the U.S. federal government acted in concert with other foreign governments through various forms of direct market intervention. Short-term interest rates on U.S. treasury instruments have declined considerably during this crisis while other short-term rates have fluctuated in excess of historical norms. As a result, in the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points or 20%, as applicable, from those at December 31, 2008. As this crisis deepened, it spread to the economies of many countries worldwide. This resulted in increased demand for the U.S. dollar due to the financial market’s perception of its relatively higher quality and liquidity. Consequently, the U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically over the second half of the year against most other currencies but also experienced unprecedented levels of volatility. Our analysis which follows assumes a hypothetical 20% change in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2008. Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our investment portfolio of available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was comprised primarily of U.S. treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government agencies, money market funds whose underlying securities were U.S. treasury and agency obligations, corporate debt instruments, commercial paper and mortgage backed securities that are guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The fair value of our investment portfolio was $9.4 billion and $6.7 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 would not have a material effect on the fair values of these securities. In addition a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 would not have a material effect on the income or cash flows. 93 Table of Contents On December 31, 2008, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value and a fair value of $10.2 billion, including $5.1 billion of convertible debt with a fair value of $4.8 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2008 was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates. On December 31, 2007, we had $11.2 billion of outstanding debt with a fair value of $10.6 billion, including $5.1 billion of convertible debt with a fair value of $4.5 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2007 was comprised of $9.2 billion of debt with fixed interest rates and $2.0 billion of debt with variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on our fixed rate debt but would impact our variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2007. A hypothetical 20% increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2007 would not have a material impact on income or cash flows with respect to our $2.0 billion of variable rate debt that was outstanding at December 31, 2007. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of all of the outstanding debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007, including, to a lesser extent, our variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2007 for which the interest rate reset quarterly. A hypothetical 20% decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2008 would result in an increase of approximately $550 million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt. A hypothetical 20% decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2007 would result in an increase of approximately $460 million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed rate debt with carrying values totaling $2.6 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These derivative contracts effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a LIBOR-based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note. A hypothetical 20% increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2008 and 2007 would not have a material effect on the fair value, cash flows or income of our interest rate swap agreements. Market price sensitive instruments As noted above, a portion of our outstanding debt may be converted into our common stock in certain circumstances. Accordingly, the price of our common stock may affect the fair value of our convertible debt. A hypothetical 20% increase in the price of Amgen stock from the price at December 31, 2008 would have increased the fair value of our then outstanding convertible debt by approximately $325 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in the price of Amgen stock from the price at December 31, 2007 would have increased the fair value of our then outstanding convertible debt by approximately $78 million. On December 31, 2008 and 2007, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio on December 31, 2008 and 2007 was not material. Foreign currency sensitive instruments Our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately the Euro, as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates are partially offset by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we have entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts. On December 31, 2008, we had outstanding forward and options contracts, primarily Euro based, with notional amounts of $2.5 billion and $386 million, respectively. On December 31, 2007, we had outstanding forward and options contracts, primarily Euro based, with notional amounts of $1.4 billion and $788 million, respectively. These contracts are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2008 the net unrealized gains and as of December 31, 2007 94 Table of Contents the net unrealized losses on these contracts were not material. With regard to these contracts, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on December 31, 2008 would result in a reduction in fair value of approximately $550 million, a reduction in income of $270 million in the ensuing year and no material impact on cash flows. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on December 31, 2007 would result in a reduction in fair value of approximately $160 million and no material reductions in income or cash flows. Also on December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $472 million and $622 million, respectively, that hedge fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. With regard to these contracts, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on December 31, 2008 would not have a material impact on fair value, income or cash flows. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on 2007 would not have a material impact on fair value, income or cash flows. The analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions and assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. We attempt to mitigate this risk through credit monitoring procedures.",2023-12-30 18:05:02.594861
318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and previously filed Form 10-K’s for further information regarding our consolidated results of operations and financial position for periods reported therein and for known factors that will impact comparability of future results. (1) In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we incurred restructuring charges of $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $148 million ($111 million, net of tax) and $739 million ($576 million, net of tax), respectively, primarily related to staff separation costs, asset impairment charges, accelerated depreciation (primarily in 2007) and loss accruals for leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our business. (2) In 2008, we completed the acquisition of Dompé Biotec, S.p.A (“Dompé”). The purchase price paid was approximately $168 million, which included the carrying value of our existing 49% ownership in Dompé. In July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Ilypsa, Inc. (“Ilypsa”) for a net purchase price of approximately $400 million. Also in July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Alantos Pharmaceuticals Holding, Inc. (“Alantos”) for a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. In October 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Avidia, Inc. (“Avidia”) for a net purchase price of approximately $275 million. In April 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abgenix for a purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion. In August 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Tularik Inc. (“Tularik”). Included in operating expenses are acquisition-related charges of $1 million, $58 million, $41 million and $12 million, in 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Acquisition charges, net of tax, for the four years ended December 31, 2008 were $1 million, $35 million, $26 million and $7 million, respectively. Acquisition charges consist of, where applicable, the incremental compensation provided to certain employees under short-term retention plans, including non-cash compensation expense associated with stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition, non-cash expense related to valuing the inventory acquired at fair value, which is in excess of our manufacturing cost, and external, incremental consulting and systems integration costs directly associated with integrating the acquired company. 62 Table of Contents (3) Included in Cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets) for 2007 is a charge of $30 million related to the write-off of the cost of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that will not be used due to a change in manufacturing strategy. (4) Included in R&D expenses for 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is the ongoing, non-cash amortization of the R&D technology intangible assets acquired with alternative future uses of $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $71 million ($44 million, net of tax) and $48 million ($30 million, net of tax), respectively, acquired with the acquisitions of Avidia and Abgenix in 2006. (5) Primarily represents the non-cash amortization of acquired product technology rights, primarily related to ENBREL, acquired in the Immunex acquisition. Amortization charges, net of tax, for the five years ended December 31, 2009 were $186 million, $183 million, $185 million, $200 million and $215 million, respectively. (6) As part of the accounting for the business combinations of Alantos and Ilypsa in 2007 and Avidia and Abgenix in 2006, under then existing accounting rules we recorded charges to write-off acquired in-process R&D (“IPR&D”) of $270 million and $320 million in 2007, respectively, and $130 million and $1.1 billion in 2006, respectively. These charges represent the estimated fair values of the IPR&D that, as of the respective acquisition dates, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. (7) In 2009, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain legal proceedings aggregating $33 million. In 2008, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, principally related to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech Products L.P. (“Ortho Biotech”) antitrust suit. In 2007, we recorded a loss accrual for an ongoing commercial legal proceeding and recorded an expense of $34 million. In 2005, we settled certain legal matters, primarily related to a patent legal proceeding, and recorded an expense of $49 million, net of amounts previously accrued. The remaining amounts included in “Other charges” in 2009, 2008 and 2007, primarily relate to restructuring charges (see Note 9, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). (8) In January 2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2039 (the “2039 Notes”). In November 2009, we repaid our $1.0 billion 4.00% notes. (9) In May 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2038 (the “2038 Notes”). In June and November 2008, we repaid our $2.0 billion of floating rate notes. (10) On March 2, 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their March 1, 2007 put option, we repurchased the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes, at their then-accreted value of $1.7 billion. In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due in 2008, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2017 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2037. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of these notes were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under an accelerated share repurchase program (“ASR”) entered into in May 2007. (11) In February 2006, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the “2011 Notes”) and $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the “2013 Notes”). In connection with the issuance of these notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also, concurrent with the issuance of these notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The cost of the convertible note hedges, which aggregated approximately $1.5 billion, was recorded as a reduction of equity. Also, concurrent with the issuance of these notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. (12) Throughout the five years ended December 31, 2009, we have had share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors through which we have repurchased $3.2 billion, $2.3 billion, $5.1 billion, $5.0 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, of Amgen common stock. 63 Table of Contents (13) Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for convertible debt that may be partially or wholly settled in cash. As required by this new standard, we retrospectively applied this change in accounting to all prior periods for which we had applicable outstanding convertible debt. Under this method of accounting, the debt and equity components of our convertible notes are bifurcated and accounted for separately. The equity components of our convertible notes, including our 2011 Convertible Notes, 2013 Convertible Notes and 2032 Modified Convertible Notes, are included in “Common stock and additional paid-in capital” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding reduction in the carrying values of these convertible notes as of the date of issuance or modification, as applicable. The reduced carrying values of our convertible notes are being accreted back to their principal amounts through the recognition of non-cash interest expense. This results in recognizing interest expense on these borrowings at effective rates approximating what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms. Included in net income for 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is non-cash interest expense of $250 million ($155 million, net of tax), $235 million ($144 million, net of tax), $168 million ($88 million, net of tax) , $197 million ($141 million, net of tax) and $67 million ($41 million, net of tax), respectively, related to the amortization of the discounts resulting from the adoption of the new accounting standard. See Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies,” Note 2, “Change in method of accounting for convertible debt instruments” and Note 16, “Financing arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 64 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward looking statements This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume,” “continue,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” We have based our forward looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (“EPS”), liquidity and capital resources and trends. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Overview The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). We are the largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We operate in a highly regulated industry and various U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we conduct our business. Government authorities in the United States and in other countries regulate the manufacturing and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities. The regulatory environment is evolving and there is increased scrutiny on drug safety and increased authority being granted to regulatory bodies, in particular the FDA, to assist in ensuring the safety of therapeutic products, which may lead to fewer products being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies, delays in receiving approvals or additional safety-related requirements or restrictions on the use of our products, including expanded safety labeling, required risk management activities, including a REMS, and/or additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of PMCs, PMRs or a pharmacovigilance program. This is increasingly true of new therapies with novel mechanisms of action. While these therapies may offer important benefits and/or better treatment alternatives, they may also involve a relatively new or higher level of scientific complexity and, therefore, generate increased safety concerns. Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by either government or private payer healthcare programs, which are placing greater emphasis on cost containment, including requiring that the economic value of products be clearly demonstrated. Governments may regulate access to, prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products and private insurers may be influenced by government reimbursement methodologies. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare 65 Table of Contents providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures. Therefore, sales of our principal products have and will continue to be affected by the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government and private insurance plans, and administration of those programs. Additionally, ongoing healthcare reform efforts may also have a significant impact on our business. For example healthcare reform, focused on expanding healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured Americans and reducing the rate of increase in the costs of healthcare, remains a priority for President Obama, U.S. Congress and a number of states. Developments in this area have been highly dynamic and difficult to predict. As recently as February 23, 2010, President Obama released a new proposal for healthcare reform which includes a combination of provisions from both the Senate and House of Representatives bills passed in late 2009. Certain healthcare reform proposals being considered, which may or may not be adopted into law, could: • restrict the coverage and reimbursement of our products by Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs • reduce the number of years of data exclusivity for innovative biological products potentially leading to earlier biosimilar competition and/or • require additional healthcare reform costs be borne by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies At this time, we cannot predict which or whether any reform measures will be adopted into law. We primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products include Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN® and ENBREL all of which are sold in the United States. ENBREL is marketed under a co-promotion agreement with Pfizer in the United States and Canada. Our international product sales consist principally of European sales of Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. For additional information about our products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see “Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates.” Our product sales are subject to certain influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and customer buying patterns, both of which fluctuate around holidays, and contract-driven customer buying. These factors can periodically result in higher U.S. wholesaler distributor inventory levels in the United States, and therefore higher product sales. We did not experience as large of an increase in wholesaler inventory levels in the fourth quarter of 2009 as in the prior year. Worldwide product sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $14.4 billion, representing a decrease of 2% compared to 2008. U.S. product sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $11.1 billion compared to $11.5 billion in 2008, representing a decrease of 3%. The decrease in U.S. product sales was largely attributable to a 24% decline in Aranesp® sales primarily reflecting the negative impact of a product safety-related label change that occurred in August 2008. Combined sales of our other products in the United States in 2009 increased 1% compared to 2008 as increased EPOGEN® sales in 2009 largely offset the decline in ENBREL sales. This decrease in ENBREL sales primarily reflects the unfavorable change in wholesaler inventories resulting from an approximate $100 million wholesaler inventory build in 2008 related to the shift of ENBREL to a wholesaler distribution model. International product sales were relatively unchanged at $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. International product sales for 2009 were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate changes of $213 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international product sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 6%. This increase in international product sales is primarily due to the launches of Vectibix®, Mimpara® and Nplate® into our existing international markets and the expansion of Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® into new international territories. Although changes in foreign currency rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales are partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to the Euro. 66 Table of Contents Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 declined approximately $650 million, or 7%, over 2008 of which approximately one-half of this reduction was attributable to lower legal settlements and restructuring and related costs. In addition, cost of sales declined in 2009 principally due to improved operating efficiencies and lower sales volume, partially offset by a less favorable product mix. Our R&D expenses in 2009 also declined primarily due to lower clinical trial costs due to the completion of certain late-stage registrational studies for denosumab and Vectibix®. These decreases in our operating expenses were partially offset by a slight increase in our SG&A expenses primarily due to increased promotional expenses, including spending for activities in advance of our anticipated launch of Prolia™. This reduction in operating expenses also reflects, in part, our continuing efforts to maintain control over discretionary expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net income was $4.6 billion, or $4.51 per share on a diluted basis, reflecting increases of 14% and 20%, respectively, compared to 2008. The growth in our net income principally reflects our reduced operating expenses, discussed above, and a reduction in our provision for income taxes primarily due to favorable income tax settlements of approximately $220 million and increased manufacturing and profits in Puerto Rico, which are taxed under an incentive grant. Our 2009 EPS also benefited from a reduction in our weighted average shares used to compute diluted EPS resulting from our stock repurchase program, including 59 million shares repurchased in 2009 at a total cost of $3.2 billion. Our financial condition remains strong. At December 31, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregated $13.4 billion, our total debt outstanding was $10.6 billion and our stockholders’ equity aggregated $22.7 billion. In addition, our cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 aggregated $6.3 billion, representing a 6% increase over the prior year. Capital expenditures for 2009 were approximately $530 million, which represents a decrease from $672 million in 2008 due to improved productivity and efficiency in our capital program. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2009, $12.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. If these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. Looking forward, we believe that our business will continue to face various regulatory, reimbursement and competitive challenges. In particular, our ESA products, Aranesp® and EPOGEN®, will continue to be impacted by regulatory developments, such as the REMS, which has been recently approved by the FDA, and recent or potential future product label changes, including any that may result from the advisory committee meeting proposed by the FDA to be held in 2010 to re-evaluate the use of ESAs in CKD. In the United States, we rely in large part on the reimbursement of our products through government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Reimbursement challenges may result from the MEDCAC meeting scheduled for March 24, 2010 to examine currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD and the provisions of the CMS’ proposed rule to implement a bundling prospective payment system for ESRD. In addition, the outcome of the proposed healthcare reform in the United States is very much uncertain at this time. Further, certain of our products will continue to face increasing competitive pressure, including our marketed products in the United States, in particular ENBREL as well as from biosimilar and other products in Europe which compete with Aranesp®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN®. We also have various opportunities to grow our business in the future, primarily due to our late-stage product candidate, denosumab. We continue to work with the FDA regarding our BLA for Prolia™. On February 19, 2010, we announced that the FDA has evaluated the content of our Complete Response submission for Prolia™ in the treatment of PMO, which we submitted on January 25, 2010, and classified it as a Class 2 resubmission. With the Class 2 designation, the FDA set a corresponding PDUFA action date of July 25, 2010. Additionally, in December 2009, the CHMP announced a positive opinion for the marketing authorization for Prolia™ for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures. Furthermore, we announced positive study results from three phase 3 denosumab trials in the treatment of bone metastases that will form the basis of the clinical evidence package for denosumab in advanced cancer, which will be submitted to regulatory authorities later 67 Table of Contents in 2010. We also expect the results in 2010 of an additional phase 3 study to evaluate denosumab in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer to prevent bone metastases. In addition, international expansion into emerging markets will also be an important opportunity for growth. Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Aranesp® $ 2,652 (15 )% $ 3,137 (13 )% $ 3,614 EPOGEN® 2,569 5 % 2,456 (1 )% 2,489 Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® 4,643 0 % 4,659 9 % 4,277 ENBREL 3,493 (3 )% 3,598 11 % 3,230 Sensipar® 651 9 % 597 29 % 463 Other 343 43 % 240 1 % 238 Total product sales $ 14,351 (2 )% $ 14,687 3 % $ 14,311 Total U.S. $ 11,135 (3 )% $ 11,460 0 % $ 11,443 Total International 3,216 0 % 3,227 13 % 2,868 Total product sales $ 14,351 (2 )% $ 14,687 3 % $ 14,311 Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our existing products more significantly than others, including: demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, government programs, regulatory developments or guidelines, clinical trial outcomes, clinical practice, contracting and pricing strategies, wholesaler and end-user inventory management practices, patient population growth, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, new product launches and indications, expansion into new countries, competitive products, product supply and acquisitions. In addition, general economic conditions may effect, or in some cases amplify, certain of these factors with a corresponding impact on our product sales. (See “Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates” for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) Aranesp® For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Aranesp® — U.S. $ 1,251 (24 )% $ 1,651 (23 )% $ 2,154 Aranesp® — International 1,401 (6 )% 1,486 2 % 1,460 Total Aranesp® $ 2,652 (15 )% $ 3,137 (13 )% $ 3,614 U.S. Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 24%. U.S. sales of Aranesp® in 2008 benefited from certain changes in accounting estimates related to product sales return reserves. Excluding the positive impact of these changes in accounting estimates, U.S. sales of Aranesp® decreased approximately 21% compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease was principally driven by a decline in demand reflecting the negative impact, primarily in the supportive cancer care setting, of a product safety-related label change which occurred in August 2008 and a low single digit decrease in the average net sales price. In addition, the decline in sales also reflects both a decline in the segment and a slight loss of segment share. 68 Table of Contents International Aranesp® sales for year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 6%, due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2009, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes of approximately $85 million, international Aranesp® sales remained unchanged. The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the negative impact on demand, primarily in the supportive cancer care setting, of physician conformance to regulatory and reimbursement developments which principally occurred in the second half of 2007, additional product label changes which occurred in 2008, and to a lesser extent, loss of segment share. The decline in demand was partially offset by an increase in the average net sales price. In addition, U.S. sales of Aranesp® for the year ended December 31, 2008 benefited from a slight change in an accounting estimate related to product sales return reserves. The regulatory and reimbursement developments negatively impacting sales, included (i) the loss of Aranesp® for use in the treatment AoC following the reported results of our AoC phase 3 study in February 2007, (ii) various ESA product safety-related label changes in the United States during 2008 and 2007 and (iii) the CMS’ NCD issued in July 2007, which significantly restricted Medicare reimbursement for use of Aranesp® in chemotherapy induced anemia (“CIA”) and which we believe has also negatively impacted Aranesp® use in CIA for patients covered by private insurance plans. The increase in international Aranesp® sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which positively impacted sales growth by approximately $104 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international Aranesp® sales decreased 5%. This decrease reflects dosing conservatism in the oncology segment and pricing pressures across all ESAs in Europe, which resulted in an overall decrease in the ESA market. In addition to other factors mentioned in the “Product sales” section above, future Aranesp® sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: • regulatory developments, including: ¡ the REMS for our ESAs, which has been recently approved by the FDA, or other risk management activities undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; ¡ the ESA product label changes reflecting certain results of our TREAT study (“TREAT label changes”); ¡ the proposed FDA advisory committee meeting in 2010 to re-evaluate the use of ESAs to treat anemia in patients with CKD; ¡ future product label changes, including those we are currently discussing with regulatory authorities; • reimbursement developments, including those resulting from: ¡ the CMS’ MEDCAC meeting in March 2010 to examine currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD; ¡ government’s and/or third-party payer’s reaction to regulatory developments, including the REMS for our ESAs, the TREAT label changes and future product label changes; ¡ changes in reimbursement rates or changes in the basis for reimbursement by the federal and state governments , including Medicare and Medicaid; ¡ cost containment pressures by third-party payers, including governments and private insurance plans; • our ability to maintain worldwide segment share and differentiate Aranesp® from current and potential future competitive therapies or products, including J&J’s Epoetin alfa product marketed in the United States and certain other locations outside of the United States and other competitors’ products outside of the United States, including biosimilar products that have been launched; • proposed healthcare reform in the United States; 69 Table of Contents • adverse events or results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, studies or meta-analyses performed by us, including our pharmacovigilance clinical trials, or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which have and could further impact product safety labeling, negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our product; • our contracting and related pricing strategies; • severity and duration of the current global economic downturn; • development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients; • patient population growth; and • expansion into new international territories. Certain of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp®. See “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” “Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” herein for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. EPOGEN® For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 EPOGEN® — U.S. $ 2,569 5 % $ 2,456 (1 )% $ 2,489 EPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 5%, primarily due to an increase in demand. The increase in demand was principally due to patient population growth, increased dose utilization and an increase in the average net sales price. The 1% decrease in EPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in demand, reflecting a decline in the average net sales price. The increase in demand resulting from patient population growth was offset by a decline in dose/utilization in certain settings. The decline in dose/utilization was related to various ESA product safety-related label changes during 2008 and 2007 and the CMS revision to its EMP, which became effective January 1, 2008. We believe that the EMP implementation significantly impacted physician behavior resulting in declines in dosing trends, as particularly noted in the quarter of implementation. However, this dose decline subsequently moderated throughout 2008. In addition to other factors mentioned in the “Product sales” section above, future EPOGEN® sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: • reimbursement developments, including those resulting from: ¡ changes in reimbursement rates or changes in the basis for reimbursement by the federal and state governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, such as the CMS proposed rule to implement the bundled prospective payment system, which becomes effective in 2011, for dialysis services, drugs and biologicals furnished for treatment of ESRD that are currently billed separately; ¡ the federal government’s reaction to regulatory developments, including the REMS for our ESAs, which has been recently approved by the FDA, and future product label changes; ¡ the CMS’ MEDCAC meeting in March 2010 to examine currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD; ¡ cost containment pressures from the federal and state governments on healthcare providers; 70 Table of Contents • regulatory developments, including those resulting from: ¡ the REMS for our ESAs or other risk management activities undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; ¡ the proposed FDA advisory committee meeting in 2010 to re-evaluate the use of ESAs in CKD; ¡ future product label changes; • changes in dose fluctuations as healthcare providers’ continue to refine their treatment practices to maintain patient Hb levels in the 10 to 12 g/dL range; • proposed healthcare reform in the United States; • severity and duration of the current global economic downturn; • governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products, including changes in medical guidelines and legislative actions; • adverse events or results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, studies or meta-analyses performed by us, including our pharmacovigilance clinical trials, or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which have and could further impact product safety labeling, negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • our contracting and related pricing strategies; • changes in dose utilization; • development of new modalities or therapies to treat anemia associated with CRF; and • patient population growth. Certain of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on future sales of EPOGEN®. See “Item 1. Business — Key Developments,” “Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Neulasta® — U.S. $ 2,527 1 % $ 2,505 7 % $ 2,351 NEUPOGEN® — U.S. 901 1 % 896 4 % 861 U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total 3,428 1 % 3,401 6 % 3,212 Neulasta® — International 828 2 % 813 25 % 649 NEUPOGEN® — International 387 (13 )% 445 7 % 416 International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® — Total 1,215 (3 )% 1,258 18 % 1,065 Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® $ 4,643 (0 )% $ 4,659 9 % $ 4,277 U.S. sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 1%, primarily due to a low single digit increase in demand partially offset by unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventories. The increase in demand was principally due to an increase in the average net sales price. International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 3%, due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in demand. For the year ended December 31, 2009, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes of approximately $94 million, 71 Table of Contents international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales increased 4%. The increase in demand was primarily due to the continued conversion from NEUPOGEN® to Neulasta® and expansion into new international territories. The increase in U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily reflects an increase in demand for Neulasta® driven by an increase in the average net sales price partially offset by a slight decline in units sold. The increase in international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects increased demand principally driven by continued conversion from NEUPOGEN® to Neulasta® as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which positively impacted the growth in combined international sales by $86 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales increased 10% compared to 2007. In addition to other factors mentioned in the “Product sales” section above, future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: • development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients; • competitive products, including biosimilar products that have been or may be approved and launched in the EU (see “Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates” for additional discussion); • the availability, extent and access to reimbursement by government and third-party payers; • proposed healthcare reform in the United States; • governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; • cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; • penetration of existing segments; • adverse events or results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, studies or meta-analyses performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could impact product safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our products, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • severity and duration of the current global economic downturn; • our contracting and related pricing strategies; • expansion into new international territories; and • patient population growth. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. ENBREL For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 ENBREL — U.S. $ 3,283 (3 )% $ 3,389 11 % $ 3,052 ENBREL — Canada 210 0 % 209 17 % 178 Total ENBREL $ 3,493 (3 )% $ 3,598 11 % $ 3,230 ENBREL sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 declined 3%, which primarily reflects an unfavorable change in wholesaler inventories resulting from an approximate $100 million wholesaler inventory build in 2008 72 Table of Contents related to a shift of ENBREL to a wholesaler distribution model, partially offset by an increase in demand. The increase in demand was driven by a mid-single digit increase in the average net sales price partially offset by a decline in units sold due to share declines as a result of competitive activity. ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects higher demand principally due to increases in the average net sales price. ENBREL sales were also favorably impacted by approximately $100 million due to a change in our distribution model for ENBREL. Previously, ENBREL was shipped directly to pharmacies. However, beginning in the three months ended March 31, 2008, we commenced using a wholesaler distributor model, similar to our other marketed products. Also, ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2008 was affected by share declines in the rheumatology and dermatology segments in the United States compared to the prior year due to increased competitive activity. However, sales growth continued in both rheumatology and dermatology. In addition to other factors mentioned in the “Product sales” section above, future ENBREL sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: • the effects of competing products or therapies, including new competitive products coming to market, such as Centocor Ortho Biotech’s Simponi™ (golimumab) and Stelara™ (ustekinumab) and UCB/Nektar Therapeutics’ Cimzia® (PEGylated anti-TNF alpha) (see “Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates”) and, in part, our ability to differentiate ENBREL based on a combination of its safety profile and efficacy; • proposed healthcare reform in the United States; • severity and duration of the current global economic downturn; • the availability, extent and access to reimbursement by government and third-party payers; • future product label changes; • risk management activities, including the proposed modification to our REMS, undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; • growth in the rheumatology and dermatology segments; • adverse events or results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, studies or meta-analyses performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could impact product safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our product; • cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; • our contracting and related pricing strategies; and • patient population growth. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. 73 Table of Contents Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (dollar amounts in millions): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Operating expenses: Cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets) $ 2,091 (9)% $ 2,296 (10)% $ 2,548 % of product sales 15% 16% 18% Research and development $ 2,864 (5)% $ 3,030 (7)% $ 3,266 % of product sales 20% 21% 23% Selling, general and administrative $ 3,820 1% $ 3,789 13% $ 3,361 % of product sales 27% 26% 23% Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets $ 294 0% $ 294 (1)% $ 298 Write-off of acquired in-process research and development $ — 0% $ — (100)% $ 590 Other charges $ 67 (82)% $ 380 (48)% $ 728 Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, (“Cost of sales”) decreased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by lower excess capacity charges, lower royalty expenses and lower sales volume, partially offset by less favorable product mix and higher fill and finish costs resulting from lower utilization at our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. The decrease in Cost of sales was also driven by lower excess inventory write-offs, primarily due to the $84 million write-off of inventory in 2008 resulting from a strategic decision to change manufacturing processes. Cost of sales decreased 10% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily driven by lower restructuring charges incurred in 2008, as discussed below. In addition, the decline in Cost of sales was due to lower inventory write-offs and lower cost ENBREL, partially offset by higher sales volume and excess capacity charges. Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 included $1 million, $6 million and $150 million, respectively, of restructuring and related charges. The restructuring charges incurred in the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily related to accelerated depreciation resulting from the decision to accelerate closure of one of our ENBREL commercial bulk manufacturing operations in connection with the rationalization of our worldwide network of manufacturing facilities. See Note 9, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Research and development R&D costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems’ costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses include costs incurred under R&D arrangements with our corporate partners, such as activities performed on behalf of KA, and costs and cost recoveries associated with collaborative R&D and in-licensing arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to collaboration partners in connection with technologies that have no alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&D costs for R&D collaborations is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. R&D expenses decreased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This decline was primarily attributable to lower clinical trial costs of $128 million, including those associated with our denosumab and Vectibix® registrational studies, our marketed products and the delay of the phase 3 motesanib NSCLC trial, and $14 million lower staff-related costs. Additionally, we incurred higher licensing fees, in 2009, related to the 74 Table of Contents $60 million expense associated with the Array BioPharma Inc. agreement and the $50 million expense resulting from the payment to Cytokinetics, partially offset by the $100 million expense in 2008 resulting from the upfront payment associated with the Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. (“Kyowa Hakko”) collaboration. R&D expenses decreased 7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, which was principally due to $102 million of lower staff-related costs and discretionary expenses; $133 million of lower clinical trial costs; $100 million of cost recoveries derived from our licensing agreements, primarily with Daiichi Sankyo and Takeda and a $16 million decline in restructuring-related costs, as discussed below, partially offset by a $100 million expense in the year ended December 31, 2008 for the upfront payment under our licensing agreement with Kyowa Hakko. Our clinical trial costs were lower for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the completion of enrollment of our large denosumab clinical trials and the related significant costs associated with site initiation and patient enrollment no longer being incurred, partially offset by increased clinical costs for our emerging pipeline. R&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 included $6 million, $3 million and $19 million, respectively, of restructuring and related charges. The restructuring charges incurred in the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily related to $38 million in charges related to asset impairments offset by a $19 million benefit associated with the reversal of previously accrued expenses for bonuses and stock-based compensation awards, which were forfeited as a result of the employees’ termination. See Note 9, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses are primarily comprised of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses include costs and cost recoveries associated with certain collaborative arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&A costs for collaborations is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. In connection with a co-promotion agreement, we and Pfizer market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada and Pfizer is paid a share of the related profits, as defined. The share of ENBREL’s profits owed to Pfizer is included in SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses increased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to higher product promotional expenses of $207 million, including increased spending for activities in anticipation of the launch of Prolia™. This increase was substantially offset by lower litigation expenses of $38 million, lower expenses associated with the Pfizer profit share of $32 million, expense recoveries associated with our GSK collaboration agreement for Prolia™ in PMO in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico of $29 million, lower staff-related costs of $28 million, lower global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system related expenses of $28 million and lower restructuring and related costs of $8 million. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the expense associated with the Pfizer profit share was $1,163 million and $1,195 million, respectively. SG&A expense increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, in part due to the impact of our restructuring plan which contributed $161 million to the increase in expenses, as discussed below. The increase was also due to higher expense associated with the Pfizer profit share of $211 million, product promotional spending of $39 million and staff-related costs of $94 million, partially offset by lower litigation expense of $50 million and lower severance costs of $21 million related to our acquisition of the remaining 51% ownership interest in Dompé. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the expense associated with the Pfizer profit share, excluding recoveries recorded as part of our restructuring, as discussed below, was $984 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $29 million for certain cost saving initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $37 million for certain restructuring charges, which primarily included $17 million in asset impairments, $12 million in loss accruals for leases principally related to certain facilities that will not be used in our business and $9 million in implementation costs associated with certain restructuring initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $114 million in cost recoveries for 75 Table of Contents certain restructuring charges, principally with respect to accelerated depreciation, in connection with our co-promotion agreement with Pfizer and $11 million of benefit associated with the reversal of previously accrued expenses for bonuses and stock-based compensation awards, which were forfeited as a result of the employees’ termination. See Note 9, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets relates to products technology rights acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2007, amortization expense also included $3 million related to the impairment of a non-ENBREL related intangible asset previously acquired in the Immunex acquisition. Write-off of acquired in-process research and development In accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations, prior to January 1, 2009, the fair value of acquired IPR&D projects, which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition, were immediately expensed. In 2007, we wrote-off $270 million and $320 million of acquired IPR&D related to the acquisitions of Alantos and Ilypsa, respectively. The Alantos IPR&D amount is related to an orally-administered treatment for type II diabetes that, at the date of acquisition, was in phase 2a clinical trials. The Ilypsa IPR&D amount is related to a phosphate binder that, at the date of acquisition, was in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on hemodialysis. We used the “income method” to determine the estimated fair values of acquired IPR&D, which uses a discounted cash flow model and applies a probability weighting based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimated future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs. These success rates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates. These cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 10%. The estimated after-tax cash flows were probability weighted at success rates of 38% for the Alantos product candidate and 77% for the Ilypsa product candidate. The incremental R&D expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approval for the Alantos and Ilypsa product candidates are immaterial. The above assumptions were used solely for the purposes of estimating fair values of these product candidates as of the date of their acquisition. However, we cannot provide assurance that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization will materialize, as estimated. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization of these product candidates are our ability to confirm their safety and efficacy based on data from clinical trials, our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and our ability to successfully complete these tasks within budgeted costs. We are not able to market a human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D may vary from its estimated value at the date of acquisition. We are continuing to develop the product candidate acquired in the Alantos acquisition. We have reviewed data from recently-completed phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for AMG 223, the product candidate acquired in the Ilypsa acquisition. The results were consistent with what is likely required for registration of a phosphate-binding therapy. However, in the context of our overall development portfolio, the Company will be reviewing other options for the commercialization of this investigational product. In addition, in 2006, we wrote-off acquired IPR&D related to the acquisition of Abgenix. The IPR&D amount was primarily related to the rights which we did not own pursuant to our agreement with Abgenix to jointly develop and commercialize panitumumab and related to a royalty that we would have owed to Abgenix with respect to future sales of denosumab as a result of using certain of Abgenix’s patented technologies in the development of this product candidate (see “Item 1. Business – Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates”). The elimination of the royalty on potential future sales of denosumab did not result in us incurring 76 Table of Contents any incremental R&D expenses. Panitumumab was Abgenix’s fully human monoclonal antibody which, at acquisition, was in phase 2/3 clinical trials for the treatment of certain types of cancer. The incremental R&D expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the various indications of panitumumab were estimated at the time of acquisition at approximately $300 million and would be incurred through 2011 and there have been no significant changes in these estimates. At the date of acquisition, we intended to develop panitumumab for treatment of various types of cancer. In 2006, panitumumab received FDA approval for the treatment of mCRC after disease progression on, or following, fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens and is marketed under the trademark Vectibix®. In December 2007, the European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorization for Vectibix® as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing mCRC with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS genes after failure of standard chemotherapy regimens. This conditional approval is reviewed annually by the CHMP, and in December 2008 we agreed as a condition of the renewal of approval to conduct an additional clinical trial in the existing approved indication. The conditional approval was granted again in December 2009. We are continuing to develop or are evaluating plans to develop Vectibix® in all of the remaining indications we had intended at the date of acquisition. However, since the acquisition, there have been several events that have affected the development plans for Vectibix® and because of these developments, our expected time to obtain regulatory approvals for the remaining indications has been delayed and the expected cost to obtain necessary approvals has increased compared to our original expectations. See “Item 1. Business – Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates” and “Item 1. Business – Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates” for developments related to Vectibix® and denosumab. Other charges As discussed in Note 9, “Restructuring” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant R&D investments and build the framework for our future growth. Subsequently, we identified certain additional initiatives designed to further assist in improving our cost structure. As a result of these restructuring and related charges, we recorded in “Other charges” in 2009, 2008 and 2007 expenses for staff separation costs of $30 million, $7 million and $209 million, respectively, asset impairments of $36 million and $366 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and charges of $4 million, $49 million and $119 million, respectively, primarily related to the loss accruals for leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our business. Also, in 2009, the Company recorded in “Other charges” loss accruals for settlements of certain legal proceedings aggregating $33 million. Also, in 2008, the Company recorded in “Other charges” loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, principally related to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech antitrust suit. In addition, in 2007, the Company recorded a $34 million loss accrual for an ongoing commercial legal proceeding. Interest expense, net For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, interest expense, net was $578 million, $551 million and $496 million, respectively. Included in interest expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $250 million, $235 million and $168 million, respectively, resulting from the adoption of the new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for our convertible debt. (See Note 2, “Change in method of accounting for convertible debt instruments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Interest and other income, net Interest and other income, net decreased 22% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This decline is primarily due to lower interest income of $45 million, principally due to lower portfolio investment returns; lower net gains on sales of investments of $28 million; and higher losses on certain leased facilities that will no longer be used in our operations of $31 million; partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange 77 Table of Contents net gains of $27 million. Interest and other income, net increased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This increase is primarily due to higher net gains on sales of investments of $79 million; higher interest income of $20 million, principally due to higher portfolio investment returns; partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange net losses of $34 million. Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 11.5%, 19.2% and 18.9% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2009 decreased over 2008 primarily due to: (i) the favorable resolution of certain prior years’ matters with tax authorities, (ii) higher profits and manufacturing in Puerto Rico, which are taxed under an incentive grant, and (iii) a tax benefit from adjustments to previously established deferred taxes arising from changes in California tax law enacted in 2009 and effective for subsequent periods. The resolution of prior years’ tax matters recognized in the year ended December 31, 2009 reduced the effective tax rate by 4.2%. Our effective tax rate for 2008 remained relatively unchanged from 2007. Although the 2007 effective tax rate benefited from the favorable resolution of certain income tax examinations, this benefit was substantially offset by the write-off of nondeductible acquired IPR&D costs, resulting in a comparable effective tax rate between the two years. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. (See “Summary of Critical Accounting Policies – Income taxes” and Note 5, “Income taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Recent accounting pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new accounting standard which amends guidance regarding consolidation of variable interest entities to address the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity. This standard also replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Additionally, this standard requires any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a variable interest entity to make ongoing assessments of whether it has a controlling financial interest in the variable interest entity and to provide enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise’s involvement in the variable interest entity. This standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2010. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which amends guidance on accounting for revenue arrangements involving the delivery of more than one element of goods and/or services. This standard addresses the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables and removes the previous separation criteria that objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any undelivered item must exist for the delivered item to be considered a separate unit of accounting. This standard also addresses how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to each deliverable. Finally, this standard expands disclosures related to multiple element revenue arrangements. This standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2011. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 78 Table of Contents Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data. The amounts reflect the adoption of a new accounting standard which changed the method of accounting for our convertible debt (see Note 2, “Change in method of accounting for convertible debt instruments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our adoption of this new accounting standard, effective January 1, 2009) (in millions): December 31, 2009 2008 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 13,442 $ 9,552 Total assets 39,629 36,427 Current debt — 1,000 Non-current debt 10,601 8,352 Stockholders’ equity 22,667 20,885 We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to opportunistically pursue our stock repurchase program and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including: cash provided by operating activities, sale of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other debt markets and equity markets. (See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business.”) Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2009, approximately $12.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. If these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. The primary objectives for our marketable security investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return, consistent with these two objectives. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. 79 Table of Contents Financing arrangements The following table reflects the carrying value of our long-term borrowings under our various financing arrangements and the amounts reflect, where applicable, the adoption of the new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for our convertible debt (dollar amounts in millions): December 31, 2009 2008 0.125% convertible notes due 2011 (2011 Convertible Notes) $ 2,342 $ 2,206 0.375% convertible notes due 2013 (2013 Convertible Notes) 2,088 1,970 5.85% notes due 2017 (2017 Notes) 1,099 1,099 4.00% notes due 2009 (2009 Notes) — 1,000 4.85% notes due 2014 (2014 Notes) 1,000 1,000 5.70% notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) 998 — 6.40% notes due 2039 (2039 Notes) 995 — 6.375% notes due 2037 (2037 Notes) 899 899 6.15% notes due 2018 (2018 Notes) 499 499 6.90% notes due 2038 (2038 Notes) 499 498 Zero-coupon modified convertible notes due in 2032 (2032 Modified Convertible Notes) 82 81 8.125% notes due 2097 (Other) 100 100 Total borrowings 10,601 9,352 Less current portion — 1,000 Total non-current debt $ 10,601 $ 8,352 In November 2009, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.00% (the “2009 Notes”) became due and were repaid. In January 2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2039 (the “2039 Notes”) in a registered offering. The 2019 Notes and the 2039 Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 5.70% and 6.40%, respectively. The 2019 Notes and the 2039 Notes may be redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a “make-whole” amount, as defined. Upon the occurrence of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a portion of the 2019 Notes and the 2039 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs totaled approximately $13 million and are being amortized over the lives of the notes. In May 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2038 (the “2038 Notes”) in a registered offering. The 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 6.15% and 6.90%, respectively. The 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes may be redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest and a “make-whole” amount, as defined. In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a portion of the 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs totaled approximately $6 million and are being amortized over the life of the notes. Upon the receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes discussed above, in June 2008 we exercised our right to call and repaid $1.0 billion of the 2008 Floating Rate Notes which were scheduled to mature in November 2008. In November 2008, the remaining $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2008 Floating Rate Notes became due and were repaid. As of December 31, 2009, we had $7.6 billion of additional notes outstanding. The notes consisted of (i) $2.3 billion of convertible notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.125% and mature in February 2011 (“2011 Convertible Notes”), (ii) $2.1 billion of convertible notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.375% and mature in February 2013 (“2013 Convertible Notes”), (iii) $1.1 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 80 Table of Contents 5.85% and mature in 2017 (“2017 Notes”), (iv) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.85% and mature in 2014 (“2014 Notes”), (v) $899 million of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.375% and mature in 2037 (“2037 Notes”), (vi) $100 million of other long-term debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.125% and mature in 2097 and (vii) zero-coupon convertible notes due in 2032 with an accreted value of $82 million and having an aggregate face amount of $105 million and yield to maturity of 1.125%. See Note 16, “Financing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our Convertible Notes. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a LIBOR-based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap agreements qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2009, we had interest rate swap agreements for our 2014 Notes and 2018 Notes, with an aggregate face value of $1.5 billion. As of December 31, 2008, we had interest rate swap agreements for our 2009 Notes, 2014 Notes, 2018 Notes and other notes, with an aggregate face value of $2.6 billion. As of December 31, 2009, we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.3 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2009, we have a $2.3 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit facility which matures in November 2012 and is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. Annual commitment fees for this facility are 0.045% based on our current credit rating. As of December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. We have filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which allows us to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units and depository shares. Under this registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2009, we have $400 million remaining under a shelf registration statement that was established in 1997. In connection with this shelf registration, we established a $400 million medium-term note program. All of the $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2009, no securities were outstanding under the $400 million medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2009. None of our financing arrangements contain any financial covenants. Our outstanding convertible notes and other outstanding long-term debt are rated “A+” with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s, “A3” with a stable outlook by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and “A” with a stable outlook by Fitch, Inc. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,336 $ 5,988 $ 5,401 Net cash used in investing activities (3,202 ) (3,165 ) (1,992 ) Net cash used in financing activities (2,024 ) (3,073 ) (2,668 ) Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2009 primarily due to higher net income of $553 million and a higher dividend payment from KA of $102 million partially offset by the prior year receipt of 81 Table of Contents $300 million for an upfront milestone payment related to our licensing agreement with Takeda; and the negative impact of the timing and amounts of receipts from customers and payments to vendors and others. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2008 primarily as a result of improvement in operating income. Investing Net purchases of marketable securities were $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to net purchases of $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 and net purchases of $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Capital expenditures totaled $530 million in 2009, $672 million in 2008 and $1.3 billion in 2007. Capital expenditures in 2009 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. Capital expenditures in 2008 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico, Fremont and other site developments and investment in our global ERP system and other information systems’ projects. Capital expenditures in 2007 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity and site expansions in Puerto Rico and other locations and investment in our global ERP system. We currently estimate 2010 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $600 million. On January 4, 2008, we completed our acquisition of Dompé and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $56 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $2 million. On July 18, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Ilypsa and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $398 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $2 million. On July 16, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Alantos and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $299 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $1 million. Financing In December 2009, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock adding to the $5.0 billion previously authorized in July 2007. As of December 31, 2009, we had $6.0 billion available for stock repurchases as authorized by our Board of Directors. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors, including the stock price, blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and our credit rating and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. A summary of our repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs is as follows (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars First quarter 37.5 $ 1,997 — $ — 8.8 $ 537 Second quarter — — 32.7 1,549 (1) 73.9 (2) 4,463 Third quarter — — — 19 (1) 2.5 (2) — Fourth quarter 21.7 1,211 12.6 700 1.8 100 Total 59.2 $ 3,208 45.3 $ 2,268 87.0 $ 5,100 (1) The total cost of shares repurchased during the three months ended June 30, 2008 excludes approximately $19 million paid in July 2008 in connection with the final settlement of an ASR program entered into in May 2008. (2) The total number of shares repurchased during the three months ended June 30, 2007 excludes 2.5 million shares received in July 2007 in connection with the final settlement of an ASR entered into in May 2007. As discussed above, in January 2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2019 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2039 resulting in net proceeds received of $2.0 billion. In November 2009, we repaid $1.0 billion of 4.00% notes that matured. As discussed above, in May 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2018 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2038 resulting in net proceeds received of $991 82 Table of Contents million. In June 2008, upon receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of these notes, we exercised our right to call and repaid $1.0 billion of floating rate notes scheduled to mature in November 2008 and in November 2008, we repaid the remaining $1.0 billion of floating rate notes that matured. In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2008 Floating Rate Notes, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.85% notes due in 2017 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% notes due in 2037, resulting in net proceeds of $4.0 billion. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of these notes were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under an ASR entered into in May 2007. On March 2, 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their March 1, 2007 put option, we repurchased $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount or the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1.7 billion in cash. In addition $135 million of other debt securities matured and were repaid in 2007. We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options. Employee stock option exercises provided $171 million, $155 million and $277 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009, aggregated by type (in millions): Contractual obligations Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 2-3years 4-5years More than5 years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 17,736 $ 323 $ 3,276 $ 4,225 $ 9,912 Operating lease obligations 1,017 136 231 184 466 Purchase obligations(2) 3,715 939 793 278 1,705 Total contractual obligations $ 22,468 $ 1,398 $ 4,300 $ 4,687 $ 12,083 (1) The long-term debt obligation amounts include future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on the 2011 Convertible Notes at a fixed rate of 0.125%, the 2013 Convertible Notes at a fixed rate of 0.375%, the 2017 Notes at a fixed rate of 5.85%, the 2014 Notes at a fixed rate of 4.85%, the 2019 Notes at a fixed rate of 5.70%, the 2039 Notes at a fixed rate of 6.40%, the 2037 Notes at a fixed rate of 6.375%, the 2018 Notes at a fixed rate of 6.15%, the 2038 Notes at a fixed rate of 6.90% and the other notes at a fixed rate of 8.125%. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements. These interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a LIBOR-based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2009 to compute the net amounts to be included in the table above for future interest payments on our variable rate interest rate swaps. 83 Table of Contents (2) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business and (v) our agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”), which we entered into on October 22, 2008, for certain information systems’ infrastructure services. The term of the agreement is five years with three one-year renewals, at our option, for a total of up to eight years. The cost to us for the initial five-year term, is estimated to be $505 million, included in the table above is $363 million for the remaining obligation. The estimated aggregate additional cost of the three one-year renewal options not included in the table above is approximately $219 million. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. Long-term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (“UTBs”) (net of federal tax benefits on state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalty totaling approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2009 are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. As of December 31, 2009, we do not have any liabilities for UTBs classified as current liabilities. In addition to the above table, we are contractually obligated to make potential future success-based development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments in conjunction with collaborative agreements we have entered into with third-parties. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and, given the nature of these events, it is unclear when, if ever, we may be required to pay such amounts. As payment of these amounts is not considered probable, these contingent payments have not been included in the table above or recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Further, the timing of any future payment is not reasonable estimable. Individually, future payment of any amounts under these arrangements is not expected to be material in any one reporting period. As of December 31, 2009, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future under all such arrangement is approximately $1.8 billion. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales, sales deductions and returns Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, “sales deductions”) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. 84 Table of Contents We analyze the adequacy of our sales deductions accruals each quarter. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in “Accrued liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets regarding sales deductions (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Cash discounts Other deductions Total Balance as of January 1, 2007 $ 788 $ 73 $ 36 $ 182 $ 1,079 Amounts charged against product sales 2,156 1,649 337 357 4,499 Payments (2,189 ) (1,652 ) (331 ) (342 ) (4,514 ) Balance as of December 31, 2007 755 70 42 197 1,064 Amounts charged against product sales 1,813 1,635 324 466 4,238 Payments (2,064 ) (1,621 ) (323 ) (418 ) (4,426 ) Balance as of December 31, 2008 504 84 43 245 876 Amounts charged against product sales 1,497 2,424 312 406 4,639 Payments (1,482 ) (2,380 ) (328 ) (355 ) (4,545 ) Balance as of December 31, 2009 $ 519 $ 128 $ 27 $ 296 $ 970 For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total sales deductions were 24%, 22% and 24% of gross product sales. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior year sales based on changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 2% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales for each of the three years ended December 31, 2009. In late 2008 we began shifting our discount structure as a component of broader contracting revisions to be more heavily weighted toward fixed prices to healthcare providers (reflected as chargebacks in the table above) instead of rebates, resulting in a corresponding reduction in rebates and an increase in chargebacks, as noted in the table above. In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are principally distributed to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using data from our wholesalers and other third-parties and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are primarily based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates earned by healthcare providers in the United States may include performance-based offers, such as attaining contractually-specified segment share or other performance-based measures. As a result, the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. These rebates totaled $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on our recent experience, changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than 3.5% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for such periods. These changes in annual estimates substantially relate to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period. A 3.5% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2009 would have had an impact of approximately $52 million on our 2009 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. 85 Table of Contents Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. These chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $2.4 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have been insignificant, amounting to less than 1% of gross product sales. Furthermore, changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant. Inventories produced in preparation for product launches The Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches when the related product candidates are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. In connection with the decision to capitalize such inventory, we evaluate among other factors any identified risks or concerns with respect to the product candidate’s safety and efficacy, the status of related discussions with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial success, including the existence of current or anticipated competitive products and any reimbursement concerns. In addition, we evaluate any risks associated with the manufacturing of the product candidate as well as considering the remaining shelf life of the inventory in relation to the expected launch date. Upon capitalization, we continue to monitor any changes in these factors. In the event of any significant negative developments, we may be required to impair previously capitalized costs. At December 31, 2009, we had capitalized approximately $258 million of inventory costs related to our late-stage product candidate, Prolia™. In the United States, Prolia™ is currently being reviewed by the FDA for use in the treatment of PMO in women. On February 19, 2010, we announced that the FDA has evaluated the content of our Complete Response submission for Prolia™ in the treatment of PMO, which we submitted on January 25, 2010, and classified it as a Class 2 resubmission. With the Class 2 designation, the FDA set a corresponding PDUFA action date of July 25, 2010. In addition in December 2009, the CHMP announced a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of Prolia™ for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures, and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures. If approved by the European Commission, we would receive marketing authorization for Prolia™ in all EU Member States. The timing of actual launch dates would vary by country based on reimbursement authority approval of pricing which could follow the EMA approval by many months. Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or 86 Table of Contents resolution of an examination. We believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in the Company’s tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements. Such timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) a tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; or (ii) an expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable U.S. and state marginal income tax rates which could materially impact our future effective tax rate. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. For example, substantial reform of U.S. tax law regarding tax on certain foreign profits could result in an increase in our effective tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 20, “Contingencies and commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items, one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a global biotechnology company with operations in various countries. We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits, requiring letters of credit and obtaining credit insurance, as we deem appropriate. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer. We also enter into various types of foreign exchange and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives. The capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has led to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. Short-term interest rates on U.S. treasury instruments have declined considerably while other short-term rates have fluctuated in excess of historical norms. As a result, in the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Similarly, over this same period there has been extraordinary 87 Table of Contents volatility in the currency markets, and we have consequentially assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our investment portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was comprised primarily of U.S. treasury securities; obligations of U.S. government agencies and FDIC guaranteed bank debt; corporate debt securities; mortgage and asset backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest bearing securities, principally comprised of commercial paper. The fair value of our investment portfolio of debt securities was $13.3 billion and $9.4 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008 would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008 would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2009, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $10.6 billion and a fair value of $11.6 billion. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $9.4 billion and a fair value of $9.8 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2009, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $760 million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2008, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $560 million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements, which qualify and have been designated as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed rate debt with notional amounts totaling $1.5 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These derivative contracts effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a LIBOR-based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008 would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. Foreign currency sensitive instruments Our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately the Euro, as a result of the sale of our products in foreign markets. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates are partially offset by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts. We enter into forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2009, we had open forward and options contracts, primarily Euro based, with notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $376 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, we had open forward and options contracts, primarily Euro based, with notional amounts of $2.5 billion and $386 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the net unrealized losses and at December 31, 2008 the net unrealized gains on these contracts were not material. With regard to forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2009, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2009, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $720 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $330 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2008, a hypothetical 20% adverse 88 Table of Contents movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2008, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $550 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $260 million. Also at December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had open forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $414 million and $472 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2009 and 2008. With regard to forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2009 and 2008 a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008 would not have had a material impact on fair value on these dates or would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions or on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market price sensitive instruments As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. We attempt to mitigate this risk through credit monitoring procedures.",2023-12-30 18:05:17.427687
318154,AMGN,AMGEN INC,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and previously filed Annual Reports on Form 10-K for further information regarding our consolidated results of operations and financial position for periods reported therein and for known factors that will impact comparability of future results. Also, see Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for information regarding cash dividends declared per common share. (1) On August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure. Under this plan in 2009, 2008 and 2007, we incurred restructuring charges of $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $148 million ($111 million, net of tax) and $739 million ($576 million, net of tax), respectively, related primarily to staff separation costs, asset impairment charges, accelerated depreciation (primarily in 2007) and loss accruals for leases on certain facilities that will not be used in our business. (2) As part of the accounting for the business combinations of Alantos Pharmaceutical Holding, Inc. and Ilypsa, Inc. in 2007, under the then existing accounting rules we recorded charges to write-off acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D) of $270 million and $320 million, respectively. The charges represent the estimated fair values of the IPR&D that, as of the respective acquisition dates, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. (3) In 2011, we recorded a $780 million legal settlement charge ($705 million, net of tax) in connection with an agreement in principle to settle allegations relating to our sales and marketing practices. In 2008, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, related principally to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech Products L.P. (Ortho Biotech) antitrust suit. 67 Table of Contents (4) Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for convertible debt that may be partially or wholly settled in cash. As required by this standard, we retrospectively applied this change in accounting to all prior periods for which we had applicable outstanding convertible debt. Under this method of accounting, the debt and equity components of our convertible notes are bifurcated and accounted for separately. The equity components of our convertible notes are included in Common stock and additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding reduction in the carrying values of these convertible notes as of the date of issuance or modification, as applicable. The reduced carrying values of our convertible notes are being accreted back to their principal amounts through the recognition of non-cash interest expense. This results in recognizing interest expense on these borrowings at effective rates approximating what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms. Included in net income for 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is the incremental non-cash interest expense of $143 million ($91 million, net of tax), $266 million ($168 million, net of tax), $250 million ($155 million, net of tax), $235 million ($144 million, net of tax) and $168 million ($88 million, net of tax), respectively, related to the adoption of the new accounting standard. (5) See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our financing arrangements. In addition, in 2008 and 2007 we issued $1.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, aggregate principal amount of notes. In 2008, we repaid our $2.0 billion of floating rate notes. In 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding zero-coupon 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their put option, we repurchased the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes, at their then-accreted value of $1.7 billion. (6) Throughout the five years ended December 31, 2011, we had a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors through which we repurchased $8.3 billion, $3.8 billion, $3.2 billion, $2.3 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, of Amgen common stock. 68 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-looking statements This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume” and “continue,” as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (EPS), liquidity and capital resources, trends and planned dividends and stock repurchases. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Overview The following management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We are the world’s largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment — human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We earn revenues and income and generate cash primarily from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, inflammation and nephrology. Our principal products include Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN®, ENBREL, Aranesp® and EPOGEN®. For additional information about our products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see Item 1. Business — Marketed Products. In 2011, we had several notable accomplishments, including achieving record U.S. and international product sales of $11.7 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. We also paid our first ever dividends, aggregating $500 million paid in 2011. In December 2011, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share of common stock payable in March 2012, representing a 29% increase over prior quarters. Additionally, in 2011, we repurchased approximately 15% of our stock outstanding as of December 31, 2010, for a total cost of $8.3 billion. Of this amount, $5 billion was purchased in a modified Dutch auction tender offer following an increase in our authorized stock repurchase program to $10 billion and our announcement that we intended to accelerate our repurchases, reflecting our confidence in the long-term value of the Company and the attractive interest rate environment. We issued $7.5 billion of debt, in part to fund the purchase of stock related to the tender offer. We expect to repurchase the remaining $5 billion of stock under our authorized stock repurchase program through open-market purchases. We enter 2012 with various opportunities to continue growing our business. We believe the currently approved indications for XGEVA® and Prolia® represent significant commercial opportunities. In addition, receiving regulatory and/or reimbursement approvals in new geographic territories or for additional indications 69 Table of Contents for these products may provide further opportunities for growth. Longer-term growth may also be achieved by expansion into emerging markets and Japan, by the successful development of our later stage pipeline and through strategic business development opportunities, such as our acquisitions of BioVex, Bergamo and our recently announced agreement to acquire Micromet. Our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies, along with the significant savings that we will realize upon the expiration of our ENBREL co-promotion agreement with Pfizer in the fourth quarter of 2013, may assist in providing the necessary resources to fund many of these future opportunities. Our business will, however, continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will continue to face increasing competitive pressure, including in Europe as a result of biosimilars. In the United States, ENBREL will also continue to face increasing competition and our ESAs may begin facing competition in the near term. Additionally, over the next several years, many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire and, as a result, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars. We also believe our products and product candidates will continue to face regulatory and reimbursement challenges. In addition, the current global economic conditions continue to pose challenges to our business, including increased pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Certain of the above challenges may have a material adverse impact on our sales, results of operations and liquidity. However, these effects may be offset by certain of the opportunities we have to grow our business, as discussed above. Selected financial information The following provides an overview of our results of operations as well as our financial condition (amounts in millions, except percentages and per-share data): 2011 Change 2010 Product sales: U.S. $ 11,725 4 % $ 11,254 International 3,570 5 % 3,406 Total product sales 15,295 4 % 14,660 Other revenues 287 (27)% 393 Total revenues $ 15,582 4 % $ 15,053 Operating expenses $ 11,270 19 % $ 9,508 Operating income $ 4,312 (22)% $ 5,545 Net income $ 3,683 (20)% $ 4,627 Diluted EPS $ 4.04 (16)% $ 4.79 Diluted shares 912 (5)% 965 When discussing changes in product sales below, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. The increase in U.S. product sales for 2011 reflects overall growth for all marketed products except ESAs, which declined 17%. Excluding sales of ESAs, U.S. product sales increased 14%, driven primarily by unit growth and, to a lesser extent, increases in average net sales prices. International product sales for 2011 were negatively impacted by a decline in sales of Aranesp® of 5%. Excluding Aranesp® sales, international product sales grew 11%. The decrease in other revenues for 2011 was due principally to certain milestone payments earned in 2010. The increase in operating expenses for 2011 was driven primarily by a legal settlement charge and higher SG&A expenses. The decrease in diluted EPS for 2011 was due to the reduction in net income, attributable primarily to lower operating income. This decrease in diluted EPS was offset partially by the favorable impact of our stock repurchase program, which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted EPS. 70 Table of Contents Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in the euro. Our results of operations for 2011 were impacted by the Puerto Rico excise tax. Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the acquisition of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. This tax is currently scheduled to expire in 2016. We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred. This excise tax has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, the overall impact of the excise tax will vary from period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable foreign tax credit. As a result of the excise tax, for 2011 cost of sales increased by $211 million, the provision for income taxes was reduced by $321 million and EPS was favorably impacted by $0.12. As of December 31, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $20.6 billion, and total debt outstanding was $21.4 billion. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2011, approximately $16.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. Results of Operations Product sales Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN ® $ 5,212 8 % $ 4,844 4 % $ 4,643 ENBREL 3,701 5 % 3,534 1 % 3,493 Aranesp® 2,303 (7)% 2,486 (6)% 2,652 EPOGEN® 2,040 (19)% 2,524 (2)% 2,569 Other products 2,039 60 % 1,272 28 % 994 Total product sales $ 15,295 4 % $ 14,660 2 % $ 14,351 Total U.S. $ 11,725 4 % $ 11,254 1 % $ 11,135 Total International 3,570 5 % 3,406 6 % 3,216 Total product sales $ 15,295 4 % $ 14,660 2 % $ 14,351 Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact the sales of certain of our existing products more significantly than others, including, but not necessarily limited to: • our contracting and pricing strategies; • recent and future reimbursement changes resulting from: ¡ governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; ¡ legislative reform in federal, state and foreign jurisdictions; 71 Table of Contents ¡ cost containment pressures; and ¡ the mix of reimbursement from governmental and private payers; • clinical trial outcomes, including adverse events or results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, studies or meta-analyses performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could impact product safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our products, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; • competitive products, including biosimilars; • physician and patient compliance with product dosing regimens; • changes in clinical practice, including those resulting from the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments; • adoption of and adherence to risk management activities, such as a REMS, undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; • product label changes; • patient population growth; • segment growth and penetration; • new product launches and indications; • expansion into new international markets; • patent expirations and our ability to obtain and defend our patent and other intellectual property rights; • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; • adequacy of product supply and distribution; • effectiveness of our marketing efforts, including those conducted under collaboration agreements; • concentration of customer purchasing power; and • acquisitions and divestures. Our U.S. product sales are also subject to certain other influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and end-user buying patterns (e.g., holiday-driven wholesaler and end-user stocking, contract-driven buying and patients purchasing products later in the year after satisfying their annual insurance deductibles). Such factors can result in higher demand for our products and/or higher wholesaler inventory levels and, therefore, higher product sales for a given three-month period, generally followed by a reduction in demand and/or a drawdown in wholesaler inventories and a corresponding decline in product sales in the subsequent three-month period. For example, sales of certain of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 have been slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three-month period, which we believe to be due, in part, to certain of these factors. While this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis, these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended March 31 with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year. In addition, general economic conditions may affect, or in some cases amplify, certain of these factors with a corresponding impact on our product sales. See Item 1. Business — Marketed Products for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications. 72 Table of Contents Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Neulasta® — U.S. $ 3,006 13 % $ 2,654 5 % $ 2,527 NEUPOGEN® — U.S. 959 3 % 932 3 % 901 Total U.S. Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® 3,965 11 % 3,586 5 % 3,428 Neulasta® — International 946 5 % 904 9 % 828 NEUPOGEN® — International 301 (15)% 354 (9)% 387 Total International Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® 1,247 (1)% 1,258 4 % 1,215 Total Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® $ 5,212 8 % $ 4,844 4 % $ 4,643 The increase in U.S. sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® for 2011 was driven principally by an increase in the average net sales price and Neulasta® unit growth. The decrease in Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® international sales was driven by a decline in NEUPOGEN® sales due, in part, to biosimilar competition, offset partially by an increase in Neulasta® sales due, in part, to continued conversion from NEUPOGEN®. The increase in U.S. sales of Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® for 2010 was driven principally by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in wholesaler inventories. The increase in international Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales for 2010 reflects primarily growth in Neulasta®, principally from the continued conversion from NEUPOGEN®, offset partially by a decline in NEUPOGEN® sales due, in part, to biosimilar competition. In addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. See Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. ENBREL Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 ENBREL — U.S. $ 3,458 5 % $ 3,304 1 % $ 3,283 ENBREL — Canada 243 6 % 230 10 % 210 Total ENBREL $ 3,701 5 % $ 3,534 1 % $ 3,493 The increase in ENBREL sales for 2011 reflects primarily an increase in the average net sales price. The increase in ENBREL sales for 2010 reflects an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by a low single-digit percentage point unit decline, resulting primarily from share declines in dermatology. ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. See Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. 73 Table of Contents Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Aranesp® — U.S. $ 986 (11)% $ 1,103 (12)% $ 1,251 Aranesp® — International 1,317 (5)% 1,383 (1)% 1,401 Total Aranesp® $ 2,303 (7)% $ 2,486 (6)% $ 2,652 The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for 2011 was due principally to a high-teens percentage point unit decline, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price. The unit decline reflects segment contraction resulting from changes to reimbursement in 2011 and the June 2011 ESA label changes. The decrease in international Aranesp® sales for 2011 was due to a decrease in the average net sales price and a unit decline, reflecting segment contraction. The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for 2010 was due primarily to a unit decline, reflecting segment contraction. The decrease in international Aranesp® sales for 2010 was due primarily to a unit decline. In addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future Aranesp® sales will depend, in part, on such factors as: • regulatory developments, including the June 2011 ESA label changes and any other product label changes; • reimbursement developments, including LCDs; • changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling; and • development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. Certain of the above factors may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp®. See Item 1. Business — Significant Developments, Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 EPOGEN® — U.S. $ 2,040 (19)% $ 2,524 (2)% $ 2,569 The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for 2011 was due primarily to a decrease in dose utilization related to changes to reimbursement in 2011 and the June 2011 ESA label changes, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price and patient population growth. The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for 2010 was due primarily to a unit decline and certain changes in accounting estimates. The unit decline reflects a decrease in dose utilization, offset partially by patient population growth. In addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future EPOGEN® sales will depend, in part, on such factors as: • potential peginesatide launch; 74 Table of Contents • reimbursement developments, including those resulting from: ¡ CMS’s 2011 Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis; and ¡ other CMS activities, including recent changes related to the QIP; • regulatory developments, including the June 2011 ESA label changes and any other product label changes; • changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling; • new contracts with dialysis centers; and • adoption of alternative therapies or development of new modalities to treat anemia associated with CRF.

Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 14.5% of product sales compared with 15.1% for 2010. This decrease was driven by improved productivity, offset partially by certain expenses related to actions to improve cost efficiencies. Cost of sales increased to 15.1% of product sales for 2010, driven primarily by higher bulk material costs and higher inventory write-offs due to voluntary EPOGEN®, PROCRIT® (epoetin alfa) and ENBREL recalls. These increases were offset partially by lower excess capacity charges and lower royalties, primarily for ENBREL. Research and development R&D costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems’ costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with K-A and third-party R&D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. The Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences, (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Company’s R&D activities as set forth in the following table: Category Description Discovery Research and Translational Sciences R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our discovery research and translational sciences functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later stage clinical programs R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. 76 Table of Contents R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Discovery Research and Translational Sciences $ 1,125 $ 1,154 $ 1,157 Later stage clinical programs 983 832 1,000 Marketed products 1,059 908 707 Total R&D expense. $ 3,167 $ 2,894 $ 2,864 The increase in R&D expense for 2011 was driven primarily by an increase of $151 million in our marketed product support largely driven by our continued support for Prolia® and XGEVA® which, subsequent to their approvals during 2010, were categorized as marketed products rather than later stage clinical programs; and an increase of $151 million in our later stage clinical program support, including AMG 386, ganitumab (AMG 479), talimogene laherparepvec and AMG 145, offset partially by decreased support for Prolia® and XGEVA® as a result of their aforementioned approvals. These increases were offset partially by a decrease of $29 million in our Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, due primarily to reduced amortization expense related to R&D technology intangible assets acquired in business combinations in prior years. The increase in R&D expense for 2010 was driven primarily by an increase of $201 million in our marketed product support largely driven by our support for Prolia® and XGEVA® which, subsequent to their approvals during 2010, were categorized as marketed products rather than later stage clinical programs and, to a lesser extent, lower cost recoveries from ongoing collaborations. This increase was offset by a reduction of $168 million in our later stage clinical programs as a result of the aforementioned approvals of Prolia® and XGEVA®, as well as licensing fees paid in 2009, and lower expenses associated with our Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $3 million. Certain amounts for 2010 have been reclassified to better conform to the above descriptions of R&D activities. Selling, general and administrative SG&A expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. SG&A expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. Beginning January 1, 2011, SG&A expenses also include the annual U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee. The increase in SG&A expense for 2011 was driven primarily by the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee of $151 million; higher ENBREL profit share expense of $104 million; increased expenses related to the launches of Prolia® and XGEVA® and expansion of our international operations of $89 million; and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $67 million. The increase in SG&A expense for 2010 was due primarily to higher promotional costs for Prolia® and other marketed products of $148 million, higher staff-related costs of $46 million and higher litigation expenses of $45 million, offset partially by charges of $29 million in 2009 for certain cost savings initiatives related to our 2007 restructuring plan. 77 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $1,288 million, $1,184 million and $1,163 million, respectively. Other In 2011, we recorded a $780 million legal settlement charge in connection with an agreement in principle to settle allegations relating to our sales and marketing practices. In addition in 2011, as part of our continuing efforts to improve cost efficiencies in our operations, we recorded certain charges, primarily severance related, of $109 million. In 2010, we recorded a $118 million asset impairment charge for our manufacturing operations located in Fremont, California, associated with our continuing efforts to optimize our network of manufacturing facilities and improve cost efficiencies. In 2009, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain legal proceedings aggregating $33 million. See Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our 2011 legal settlement. Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense, net $ 610 $ 604 $ 578 Interest and other income, net $ 448 $ 376 $ 276 Provisions for income taxes $ 467 $ 690 $ 599 Effective tax rate 11.3 % 13.0 % 11.5 % Interest expense, net Included in interest expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $143 million, $266 million and $250 million, respectively, resulting from the change in the accounting for our convertible debt effective January 1, 2009. The reduction of non-cash interest expense in 2011 was offset by increased interest expense associated with recent borrowings. Interest and other income, net The increase in interest and other income, net, for 2011 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments of $67 million. The increase in interest and other income, net, for 2010 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments of $48 million and higher interest income of $51 million, due principally to higher average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. Income taxes The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2011 was due primarily to the foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax described below offset partially by the effect of the non-deductible U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee in 2011, the non-deductible portion of the legal settlement reached in principle in 2011 and the favorable resolution in 2010 of certain prior years’ non-routine transfer pricing matters with tax authorities. Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the acquisition of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is imposed over a six year period beginning in 2011 with the excise tax rate declining in each year (4% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in 2013, 2.5% in 2014, 2.25% in 2015, and 1% in 2016). We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred. The effective tax rate for 2011 would have been approximately 18% without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. 78 Table of Contents The increase in our effective tax rate for 2010 was due primarily to the incremental favorable impact resulting from the resolution of certain prior years’ matters with tax authorities in 2009 compared to 2010; the unfavorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix in 2010; and the tax impact from adjustments to deferred taxes arising from changes in California tax law enacted in 2009 and effective for subsequent periods. The resolution of prior years’ tax matters recognized in 2010 and 2009 reduced the effective tax rate by 3.1% and 4.2%, respectively. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies — Income taxes and Note 4, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Recent accounting pronouncements In June 2011, a new accounting standard was issued that changed the disclosure requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income (OCI) in the financial statements, including the elimination of the option to present OCI in the statement of stockholders’ equity. OCI and its components will be required to be presented for both interim and annual periods either in a single financial statement, the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate but consecutive financial statements, consisting of a statement of income followed by a separate statement presenting OCI. This standard is required to be applied retrospectively beginning January 1, 2012, except for certain provisions for which adoption was delayed. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected financial data was as follows as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in millions): 2011 2010 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 20,641 $ 17,422 Total assets 48,871 43,486 Current portion of long-term debt 84 2,488 Long-term debt 21,344 10,874 Stockholders’ equity 19,029 23,944 The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers, as well as market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors — There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock). In April 2011, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5 billion of our common stock. Subsequently in October 2011, the Board of Directors increased the total authorization for stock repurchases by $6.1 billion to $10 billion. At that time, we announced our intent to accelerate our stock repurchase program, reflecting our confidence in the long-term value of the Company and the attractive interest rate environment. During 2011, we repurchased 144 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $8.3 billion, including $5 billion purchased in a modified Dutch auction tender offer. We expect to repurchase the remaining $5 billion of stock under our authorized stock repurchase program through open-market purchases. In April 2011, the Board of Directors also approved a dividend policy related to our common stock and subsequently declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.28 per share of common stock in July and October 2011, resulting in dividend payments aggregating $500 million in 2011. Additionally in December 2011, the Board of Directors declared a 29% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.36 per share of common stock, payable in March 2012. 79 Table of Contents We believe existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as “U.S. funds”) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent upon the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, customers outside the United States, which include government owned or supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent, in part, upon the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Deteriorating credit and economic conditions in parts of Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, may continue to increase the average length of time it takes to collect payments, particularly in certain regions within these countries. However, the timing of payments from government healthcare providers has not nor is it expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows. To date we have not incurred any significant losses on collections of trade receivables from these government healthcare providers. Over the next several years, many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire. As a result, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars that may have a material adverse impact on our product sales, results of operations and liquidity. Upon patent expiration for small molecule products, there is typically intense competition from generics manufacturers, which generally leads to significant and rapid declines in sales of the branded product. Given that our principal products are biologics, we do not believe the impact of biosimilar competition will be as significant as with small molecule products, in part because successful competitors must have a broad range of specialized skills and capabilities unique to biologics, including significant regulatory, clinical and manufacturing expertise, and since the products are similar, but not identical, the biosimilars will have to compete against a product with an established efficacy and safety record. As discussed above, we have many opportunities to grow our business, including the continued commercialization of XGEVA® and Prolia® and expansion into emerging markets and Japan, which we believe may offset the adverse financial impact of our principal products’ patent expiries. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2011, approximately $16.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2011, were $84 million and $21.3 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2010, were $2.5 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively. 80 Table of Contents We issued debt securities in various offerings during the three years ended December 31, 2011, including: • In 2011, we issued $10.5 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, comprised of the 1.875% 2014 Notes, the 2.30% 2016 Notes, the 2.50% 2016 Notes, the 4.375% 2018 euro Notes (€550 million aggregate principal amount), the 4.10% 2021 Notes, the 3.875% 2021 Notes, the 5.50% 2026 pound sterling Notes (£475 million aggregate principal amount), the 5.15% 2041 Notes and the 5.65% 2042 Notes. • In 2010, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, comprised of the 4.50% 2020 Notes, the 3.45% 2020 Notes, the 5.75% 2040 Notes and the 4.95% 2041 Notes. • In 2009, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, comprised of the 5.70% 2019 Notes and the 6.40% 2039 Notes. In February 2011, our 0.125% 2011 Convertible Notes became due, and we repaid the $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount. No debt was due or repaid in 2010, and we repaid $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.00% in 2009. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our pound sterling denominated long-term notes issued in 2011, we entered into cross currency swap contracts. These cross currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest payments in pounds sterling at a fixed rate of 5.5% on £475 million and pay interest in U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of 5.8% on $748 million, the aggregate notional amounts paid to/received from the counterparties upon exchange of currencies at the inception of these contracts. We will pay U.S. dollars to and receive pounds sterling from the counterparties at the maturity of the contracts for the same notional amounts. The terms of these contracts correspond to the related hedged notes, effectively converting the interest payments and principal repayment on these notes from pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2011, we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In December 2011, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. We would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2011, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In connection with the new revolving credit agreement we terminated our prior $2.3 billion revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in November 2012. In March 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to replace an existing shelf registration statement that was scheduled to expire in April 2011. This shelf registration statement allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in March 2014. 81 Table of Contents In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2011. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements. Cash flows Our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,119 $ 5,787 $ 6,336 Net cash used in investing activities (786 ) (4,152 ) (3,202 ) Net cash used in financing activities (674 ) (1,232 ) (2,024 ) Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during the 2011 due primarily to: increased interest payments; working capital increases related to the launch of Prolia® and XGEVA®; and the prepayment of certain royalties. The reduction in net income during 2011 was driven primarily by the accrual of the legal settlement charge of $780 million, which will be paid in a subsequent period. Cash provided by operating activities during 2010 decreased due primarily to the timing and amount of payments to taxing authorities. Investing Capital expenditures totaled $567 million, $580 million and $530 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. We currently estimate 2012 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2011, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses totaling $701 million. Net proceeds from marketable securities were $437 million for 2011, compared to net purchases of marketable securities of $3.5 billion for 2010 and $2.7 billion for 2009. Financing Cash used in financing activities during 2011 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $8.3 billion, including $5 billion purchased in a modified Dutch auction tender offer in December 2011; repayment of long-term debt of $2.5 billion; and payment of dividends of $500 million, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $10.4 billion, including $7.5 billion issued in November and December 2011, in part, to finance the repurchase of our common stock in the modified Dutch auction tender offer. Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $3.8 billion, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $2.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2009 was due to repurchases of our common stock of $3.2 billion and repayment of long-term debt of $1.0 billion, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $2.0 billion. 82 Table of Contents See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period Year Years Years Years Contractual obligations Total 1 2 and 3 4 and 5 6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) $ 37,521 $ 888 $ 6,131 $ 3,396 $ 27,106 Operating lease obligations 774 116 189 141 328 Purchase obligations (4) 2,992 865 420 243 1,464 Unrecognized tax benefits (5) — — — — — Total contractual obligations $ 41,287 $ 1,869 $ 6,740 $ 3,780 $ 28,898 (1) The long-term debt obligation amounts also include future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2011, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net reduction in future interest payments of $366 million. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts. (2) In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our pound sterling denominated long-term debt issued in December 2011, we entered into cross currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest and principal payments and on this debt. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross currency swap contracts. (3) The long-term debt obligations amounts include the repayment of principal on our euro denominated foreign currency debt at the foreign currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2011. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations. (4) Purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third-party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. 83 Table of Contents (5) Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $912 million at December 31, 2011, are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred with the acquisition of BioVex. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the BioVex contingent consideration, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2011, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $3.6 billion, including $575 million in connection with the acquisition of BioVex (see Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales, sales deductions and returns Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, “sales deductions”) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions Total Balance as of January 1, 2009 $ 653 $ 84 $ 139 $ 876 Amounts charged against product sales 1,663 2,424 552 4,639 Payments (1,609 ) (2,380 ) (556 ) (4,545 ) Balance as of December 31, 2009 707 128 135 970 Amounts charged against product sales 1,861 2,593 580 5,034 Payments (1,724 ) (2,548 ) (588 ) (4,860 ) Balance as of December 31, 2010 844 173 127 1,144 Amounts charged against product sales 1,795 2,626 670 5,091 Payments (1,592 ) (2,600 ) (717 ) (4,909 ) Balance as of December 31, 2011 $ 1,047 $ 199 $ 80 $ 1,326 For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, total sales deductions were 25%, 25% and 24% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent 2% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales for the three year ended December 31, 2011. 84 Table of Contents In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. We estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid based on the product sold, contractual terms, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We adjust the accrual as more information becomes available and to reflect actual experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which for certain rebates can take up to one year and greater than one year for certain recent government programs. Rebates totaled $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than 5% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011. A 5% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2011 would have had an impact of approximately $90 million, or approximately one-half of 1% of our 2011 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Those chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $2.6 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have been insignificant, amounting to less than 1.5% of gross product sales. Furthermore, changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant. Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. 85 Table of Contents We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in the Company’s tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements. Such timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) a tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; or (ii) an expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements. The Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Company’s pre-tax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Company’s operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Company’s foreign income associated with the Company’s operations conducted in Puerto Rico. If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors — The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.) Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 86 Table of Contents Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: • determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; • projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; • estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and • developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of the various contingent consideration obligations incurred in the acquisition of BioVex (see Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In the capital and credit markets, strong demand for fixed income instruments led to historically low interest rates on corporate debt issuances during 2011. Short-term interest rates on U.S. Treasury instruments continued to decline due to a combination of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies and the challenging macroeconomic environment. As a result, in the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Continued uncertainty surrounding European sovereign debt resulted in ongoing volatility in the foreign exchange markets, and we have consequently assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our portfolio of available-for-sale debt security investments at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was comprised of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; mortgage- and 87 Table of Contents asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and additionally at December 31, 2010, other short-term interest bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair value of our investment portfolio of debt securities was $20.0 billion and $17.3 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2011 and 2010, would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2011 and 2010, would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $21.4 billion and a fair value of $23.0 billion. As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $13.4 billion and a fair value of $14.5 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.1 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2010, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $1.0 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap and cross currency swap contracts. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we have entered into interest rate swap contracts, which qualify and have been designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed rate debt with notional amounts totaling $3.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010. These derivative contracts effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2011 and 2010, would have resulted in a reduction fair value of approximately $200 million on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2011, we had open cross currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $748 million that hedge the entire principal amount of our pound sterling denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert payments on this debt to U.S. dollars and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in approximately a $130 million reduction in the fair value of our cross currency swap contracts on this date but would not have a material effect on cash flows or income in the ensuing year. Foreign currency sensitive financial instruments Our international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value and fair value of $1.5 billion that was denominated in pounds sterling and euros. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would have 88 Table of Contents resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $290 million on this date with a corresponding reduction in income in the ensuing year and would not result in a material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign exchange would have on the related cross currency swap contracts. With regard to our cross currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of our pound sterling denominated debt, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair value of these contracts of approximately $210 million on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The impact on income in the ensuing year of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which would equal the entire change in the carrying amount of the hedged debt, would be approximately $150 million. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2011, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.5 billion and $292 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.2 billion and $398 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the net unrealized gains on these contracts were not material. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2011, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $700 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $330 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2010, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2010, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $670 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $330 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $389 million and $670 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2011 and 2010. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2011, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would not have resulted in a material reduction in the fair value of these contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2010, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2010, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts on these dates of approximately $130 million and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market price sensitive financial instruments As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by 89 Table of Contents requiring transactions to be with institutions with investment grade credit ratings and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.",2023-12-30 18:05:18.516779

In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume” and “continue,” as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (EPS), liquidity and capital resources, trends and planned dividends and stock repurchases. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.OverviewThe following management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).We are a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. Our medicines help millions of patients in the fight against cancer, kidney disease, RA, bone disease and other serious illnesses. We operate in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.We earn revenues and income and generate cash primarily from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, inflammation, nephrology and bone disease. Our principal products include Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN®, ENBREL, Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, XGEVA® and Prolia®. For additional information about our products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see Item 1. Business — Marketed Products.In 2012, we had several notable accomplishments, including achieving 11% revenue growth driven by strong performance across the portfolio. Product sales grew 9% in the United States and 7% in the ROW. We also continued paying quarterly dividends in 2012, and in December, we declared a dividend of $0.47 per share of common stock payable in March 2013, representing a 31% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in each of the past four quarters. Additionally, we repurchased 62 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $4.7 billion in 2012. Under our $10 billion authorized stock repurchase program announced in October 2011, we have repurchased a total of 146 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $9.7 billion at an average price of $66.37. Finally, we made significant advances in our product pipeline in 2012 including advancing AMG 145, brodalumab, romosozumab and rilotumumab to phase 3 clinical trials.We enter 2013 with various opportunities to continue growing our business. We believe the currently approved indications for XGEVA® and Prolia® represent significant commercial opportunities. Longer-term growth may also be achieved by the successful development of our later stage pipeline, by expansion into emerging markets and Japan, and through strategic business development opportunities, such as our acquisitions of Micromet and MN in 2012. Our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies will assist in providing the necessary resources to fund many of these future opportunities.Our business will, however, continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will face increasing competitive pressure as a result of competitive product launches. In the United States, ENBREL, EPOGEN® and XGEVA®, in particular, will be facing increased competition. Additionally, over the next several years, starting in 2013, certain of the existing patents on our principal products — including NEUPOGEN®, EPOGEN® and Aranesp® — will expire and, as a result, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars. For additional information, including with regard to the expiration of the patents for various products, see Item 1. Business — Marketed Products.60Current global economic conditions also pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Efforts to reduce health care costs are being made by third-party payers including governments and private payers. In the United States, various actions have been taken aimed at reducing healthcare spending. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce our revenues or increase our expenses may be enacted. As a result of the economic condition, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures in certain European countries also.Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. The discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses. Our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched, as well as to provide for revenue and earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy before and after products have been launched.Finally, our product sales are subject to certain influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and end-user buying patterns (e.g., wholesaler and end-user stocking, contract-driven buying and patients delaying certain purchasing or physician visits). Such factors can result in higher demand for our products and/or higher wholesaler inventory levels and, therefore, higher product sales for a given three-month period, generally followed by a decline in product sales in the subsequent three-month period. For example, sales of certain of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 can be slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three-month period. While this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis, these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended March 31 with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year. See Item 1. Business — Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales.Selected financial informationThe following is an overview of our results of operations as well as our financial condition (in millions, except percentages and per share data): 2012 Change 2011Product sales: U.S.$12,815 9 % $11,725ROW3,824 7 % 3,570Total product sales16,639 9 % 15,295Other revenues626 * 287Total revenues$17,265 11 % $15,582Operating expenses$11,688 4 % $11,270Operating income$5,577 29 % $4,312Net income$4,345 18 % $3,683Diluted EPS$5.52 37 % $4.04Diluted shares787 (14)% 912* Change in excess of 100%When discussing changes in product sales below, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.The increase in U.S. product sales for 2012 reflects growth across the portfolio except ESAs, which declined 10%. Excluding ESAs, U.S. product sales increased 16% driven primarily by unit growth and, to a lesser extent, increases in average net sales prices. The increase in ROW product sales for 2012 reflects growth for all of our marketed products except Aranesp®, which declined 4%, and combined Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN®, which declined 9%.The increase in other revenues for 2012 was driven by a modification to our Takeda collaboration, which replaced a global co-development and profit share agreement for motesanib, originally signed in 2008, with an exclusive license for Takeda to 61develop, manufacture and commercialize motesanib. That modification resulted in revenue recognition of $232 million. The increase also reflects milestone payments received from AstraZeneca and Astellas Pharma Inc.Operating expenses in 2011 included a previously disclosed charge for a legal settlement reserve of $780 million.The increase in net income for 2012 was due primarily to higher operating income, offset partially by higher interest expense, net, and higher effective income tax rates.The increase in diluted EPS for 2012 was driven primarily by increases in net income and by the favorable impacts of our stock repurchase program, which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted EPS.Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros.Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the purchase of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is imposed on the gross intercompany purchase price of the goods and services and is effective for a six-year period beginning in 2011, with the excise tax rate declining in each year (4% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in 2013, 2.5% in 2014, 2.25% in 2015 and 1% in 2016). In February 2013, the Puerto Rico government proposed an amendment to the excise tax legislation which, if approved, would increase the excise tax rate to 4% effective July 1, 2013 through 2017. We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred. This excise tax has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, the overall impact of the excise tax will vary from period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable foreign tax credit. As a result of the excise tax in 2012, cost of sales increased by $343 million, the provision for income taxes was reduced by $337 million and EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.01. In 2011, cost of sales increased by $211 million, the provision for income taxes was reduced by $321 million and EPS was favorably impacted by $0.12.As of December 31, 2012, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $24.1 billion, and total debt outstanding was $26.5 billion. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2012, approximately $18.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.Results of OperationsProduct salesWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN ®$5,352 3 % $5,212 8 % $4,844ENBREL4,236 14 % 3,701 5 % 3,534Aranesp®2,040 (11)% 2,303 (7)% 2,486EPOGEN®1,941 (5)% 2,040 (19)% 2,524XGEVA®748 * 351 * 8Prolia®472 * 203 * 33Other products1,850 25 % 1,485 21 % 1,231Total product sales$16,639 9 % $15,295 4 % $14,660Total U.S.$12,815 9 % $11,725 4 % $11,254Total ROW3,824 7 % 3,570 5 % 3,406Total product sales$16,639 9 % $15,295 4 % $14,660* Change in excess of 100%Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Item 1.

The decrease in ROW Neulasta® sales for 2012 was due primarily to a decrease in unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe and a decrease in the average net sales price.The increase in U.S. NEUPOGEN® sales for 2012 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price. The decrease in ROW NEUPOGEN® sales for 2012 was driven by a decrease in unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe.The increase in U.S. Neulasta® sales for 2011 was driven by increases in both unit demand and the average net sales price. The increase in ROW Neulasta® sales for 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in unit demand.The increase in U.S. NEUPOGEN® sales for 2011 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by a decrease in unit demand. The decrease in ROW NEUPOGEN® sales for 2011 was driven by a decrease in unit demand, in part, from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe, and a decrease in the average net sales price. Our outstanding material U.S. patents for Filgrastim (NEUPOGEN®) expire in December 2013. We expect to face competition in the United States beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, which may have a material adverse impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN® and, in turn, Neulasta®. See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion of the potential impact of patent expiration. Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) expires in 2015.Future Neulasta®/NEUPOGEN® sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.ENBRELTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010ENBREL — U.S. $3,967 15% $3,458 5% $3,304ENBREL — Canada 269 11% 243 6% 230Total ENBREL $4,236 14% $3,701 5% $3,534The increase in ENBREL sales for 2012 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, an increase in unit demand.The increase in ENBREL sales for 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price.ENBREL also faces increased competition. See Item 1.

The unit decline reflects changes in practice patterns resulting from changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011 (2011 changes). The decrease in ROW Aranesp® sales for 2012 was due primarily to a decrease in the average net sales price.Sequentially, global Aranesp® unit demand was down 5% in the quarter ended December 31, 2012, compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2012.The decrease in U.S. Aranesp® sales for 2011 was driven primarily by a decline in unit demand due to the impact of the 2011 changes, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price. The decrease in ROW Aranesp® sales for 2011 was due to a decrease in the average net sales price and a unit decline, reflecting segment contraction.EPOGEN® Total EPOGEN® sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010EPOGEN® — U.S.$1,941 (5)% $2,040 (19)% $2,524The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for 2012 was driven by a 23% decrease in unit demand, driven by reductions in dose utilization due to changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred in 2011. This decrease was offset partially by reductions in customer discounts, as part of new provider contracts that became effective January 1, 2012, and by a year-over-year favorable change in accounting estimates of $96 million.The decrease in EPOGEN® sales for 2011 was due primarily to a decrease in unit demand due to the impact of the 2011 changes, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price and patient population growth.Future EPOGEN® sales will also depend, in part, on such factors as:•increased competition in the U.S. dialysis setting;•changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling;•new or amended contracts with dialysis centers; and•adoption of alternative therapies or development of new modalities to treat anemia associated with CKD.XGEVA® and Prolia® Total XGEVA® and total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010XGEVA® — U.S.$644 88% $343 * $8XGEVA® — ROW104 * 8 N/A —Total XGEVA®748 * 351* 8Prolia® — U.S.292 * 130 * 26Prolia® — ROW180 * 73 * 7Total Prolia®472 * 203 * 33Total XGEVA®/Prolia®$1,220 * $554 * $41* Change in excess of 100%64The increases in global XGEVA® and Prolia® sales for 2012 and 2011 were driven primarily by unit growth.Sequentially, global XGEVA® and Prolia® sales increased 7% and 40%, respectively, in the quarter ended December 31, 2012, compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2012.XGEVA® also faces increased competition.

Excluding the impacts of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 15.5% and 14.5% of product sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.Cost of sales increased to 15.9% of product sales for 2011. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 14.5% of product sales compared with 15.1% for 2010. The decrease was driven by improved productivity, offset partially by certain expenses related to actions to improve cost efficiencies.65Research and developmentR&D costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems’ costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with K-A and third-party R&D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery.The Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences, (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Company’s R&D activities as set forth in the following table:Category DescriptionDiscovery Research and Translational Sciences R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our discovery research and translational sciences functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development.Later stage clinical programs R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU.Marketed products R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained.R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): 2012 2011 2010Discovery Research and Translational Sciences$1,137 $1,125 $1,154Later stage clinical programs1,285 983 832Marketed products958 1,059 908Total R&D expense$3,380 $3,167 $2,894The increase in R&D expense for 2012 was driven primarily by an increase of $302 million in our later stage clinical programs, including AMG 145 and romosozumab; and an increase of $12 million in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $101 million.The increase in R&D expense for 2011 was driven primarily by an increase of $151 million in our marketed product support driven largely by our continued support for Prolia® and XGEVA® which, subsequent to their approvals during 2010, were categorized as marketed products rather than later stage clinical programs; and an increase of $151 million in our later stage clinical program support, including AMG 386, ganitumab (AMG 479), talimogene laherparepvec and AMG 145, offset partially by decreased support for Prolia® and XGEVA® as a result of their aforementioned approvals. These increases were offset partially by a decrease of $29 million in our Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, due primarily to reduced amortization expense related to R&D technology intangible assets acquired in business combinations in prior years.Selling, general and administrativeSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. SG&A expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or when we become entitled to the cost recovery. Beginning January 1, 2011, SG&A expenses also include the annual U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee.66The increase in SG&A expense for 2012 was driven primarily by higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $207 million as well as international expansion of $87 million, offset partially by lower U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee expense of $106 million in 2012 compared with 2011, which includes a $61 million favorable adjustment related to the 2011 fee.The increase in SG&A expense for 2011 was driven primarily by the U.S. healthcare reform estimated federal excise fee of $151 million; higher ENBREL profit share expense of $104 million; increased expenses related to the launches of Prolia® and XGEVA® and expansion of our international operations of $89 million; and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $67 million.For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $1,495 million, $1,288 million and $1,184 million, respectively.OtherOther operating expenses for 2012 included certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives of $175 million, which includes severance and expenses associated with abandoning leased facilities, legal proceedings charges of $64 million and other operating expenses of $56 million, which includes adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to a prior-year business combination.Other operating expenses for 2011 included primarily a legal settlement charge of $780 million and certain charges related to cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $109 million.In 2010, we recorded a $118 million asset impairment charge for our manufacturing operations located in Fremont, California, associated with our efforts to optimize our network of manufacturing facilities and improve cost efficiencies.See Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our 2011 legal settlement.Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxesNon-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2012 2011 2010Interest expense, net$1,053 $610 $604Interest and other income, net$485 $448 $376Provisions for income taxes$664 $467 $690Effective tax rate13.3% 11.3% 13.0%Interest expense, netIncluded in interest expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $140 million, $143 million and $266 million, respectively, on our convertible debt. The increase of interest expense in 2012 was due primarily to a higher average debt balance.Interest and other income, netThe increase in interest and other income, net, for 2012 was due primarily to higher interest income due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities offset partially by lower yields and lower net gains realized on investments.The increase in interest and other income, net, for 2011 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments.Income taxesThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2012 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and the exclusion of the federal R&D tax credit in 2012, offset partially by the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters related to prior years. Because the ATRA of 2012 was not enacted until 2013, certain provisions of the Act which will retroactively benefit the Company's 2012 federal taxes, including the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2012, cannot be recognized in the Company's 2012 financial results and instead will be reflected in the company's 2013 financial results for the first quarter. The tax benefit of the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit that will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013 is approximately $65 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2012, we also settled the examination of our U.S. tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service relating to years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009. We will recognize the tax 67impact of this settlement in the first quarter of 2013. We expect the settlement to result in a tax benefit of approximately $185 million. The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2011 was due primarily to the foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax described below offset partially by the effect of the non-deductible U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee in 2011, the non-deductible portion of the legal settlement reached in principle in 2011 and the favorable resolution in 2010 of certain prior years' non-routine transfer pricing matters with tax authorities.Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the purchase of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is imposed on the gross intercompany purchase price of the goods and services and is effective for a six-year period beginning in 2011, with the excise tax rate declining in each year (4% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in 2013, 2.5% in 2014, 2.25% in 2015 and 1% in 2016). In February 2013, the Puerto Rico government proposed an amendment to the excise tax legislation which, if approved, would increase the excise tax rate to 4% effective July 1, 2013 through 2017. We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred. The effective tax rates for 2012 and 2011 would have been approximately 18.7% and 18.0%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax.As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States.See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies — Income taxes and Note 4, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected financial data was as follows as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): 2012 2011Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$24,061 $20,641Total assets54,298 48,871Current portion of long-term debt2,495 84Long-term debt24,034 21,344Stockholders’ equity19,060 19,029The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers, and market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors — There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock). During 2011, we repurchased a total of 144 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $8.3 billion. In October 2011, we announced our intent to accelerate our repurchase program and that our Board of Directors had authorized an increase in our stock repurchase program to $10 billion. Subsequent to this authorization through December 31, 2011, we repurchased 83 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $5.0 billion. During 2012, we repurchased 62 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $4.7 billion. This brings the total of shares repurchased under this approved $10 billion authorization to 146 million at a total cost of $9.7 billion at an average cost of $66.37 per share. In December 2012, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase authorization by $2.0 billion, and as of December 31, 2012, $2.3 billion remained available under this stock repurchase program, which is expected to cover our share repurchase activity into 2014. In February 2013, our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes matured/converted, and accordingly, the $2.5 billion principal amount was settled in cash. We also elected to pay the note holders who converted their notes $99 million of cash for the excess conversion value, as allowed by the original terms of the notes, which was offset by the receipt of the same amount of cash from the counterparty to the related convertible note hedge. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these convertible notes.68In April 2011, the Board of Directors approved a dividend policy related to our common stock and subsequently declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.28 per share of common stock in July and October 2011, resulting in dividend payments aggregating $500 million in 2011. In December 2011, the Board of Directors declared a 29% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.36 per share of common stock, resulting in dividend payments aggregating $1.1 billion in 2012. In December 2012, the Board of Directors declared a 31% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.47 per share of common stock, payable in March 2013.We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as “U.S. funds”) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of December 31, 2012, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $400 million, of which $281 million was past due, with the past due receivables primarily in Italy, Spain and Portugal. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.Over the next several years, certain of the existing patents on our principal products will expire. As a result, we expect to face increasing competition thereafter, including from biosimilars, which may have a material adverse impact on our product sales, results of operations and liquidity. In the EU, there is already an established regulatory pathway for biosimilars and we are facing increasing competition from biosimilars. The 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars under a new, abbreviated pathway. (See Item 1. Business — Marketed Products.) In the United States after patent expiration, we expect to face greater competition than today, including from manufacturers with biosimilars approved in Europe that may seek to obtain U.S. approval. We have many opportunities to grow our business, including the continued commercialization of XGEVA® and Prolia® and expansion into emerging markets and Japan, which we believe may offset the adverse financial impact of our principal products' patent expiries.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesOf our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2012, approximately $18.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.Financing arrangementsThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2012, were $2.5 billion and $24.0 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2011, were $84 million and $21.3 billion, respectively.69We issued debt securities in various offerings during the three years ended December 31, 2012, including $5.0 billion, $10.5 billion and $2.5 billion aggregate principal amounts of notes in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.In 2012, we repaid $123 million of debt, including the redemption of all of our outstanding zero-coupon convertible notes due in 2032 and debt assumed in the acquisition of MN and deCODE Genetics. In February 2011, our 0.125% 2011 Convertible Notes became due, and we repaid the $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount. No debt was due or repaid in 2010.To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and were designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2011, we had interest rate swap contracts on debt with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion, which, due to historically low interest rates, were terminated in May 2012. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts.To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion and $748 million, respectively. See Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2012, we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.In December 2011, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.In March 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to replace an existing shelf registration statement that was scheduled to expire in April 2011. This shelf registration statement allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in March 2014.In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program.Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2012.See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements.Cash flowsOur cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): 2012 2011 2010Net cash provided by operating activities$5,882 $5,119 $5,787Net cash used in investing activities(9,990) (786) (4,152)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities419 (674) (1,232)70OperatingCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2012 due primarily to the timing and amount of receipts from customers, an increase in net income, timing of payments to vendors and taxing authorities, cash received in connection with the termination of our interest rate swap agreements of $397 million and the impact of decreased inventory-related expenditures. These increases were offset partially by a payment associated with the previously disclosed litigation settlement. Cash provided by operating activities during 2011 decreased due primarily to increased interest payments, working capital increases related to the launch of Prolia® and XGEVA® and the prepayment of certain royalties.InvestingCapital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Ireland and Puerto Rico, as well as other site developments, totaled $689 million, $567 million and $580 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We currently estimate 2013 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million.Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $2.4 billion and $701 million, respectively.Net purchases of marketable securities were $6.9 billion for 2012, compared to net proceeds of $437 million for 2011 and net purchases of $3.5 billion for 2010.FinancingCash provided by financing activities during 2012 was due to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.9 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $1.3 billion, offset partially by repurchases of our common stock of $4.6 billion and the payment of dividends of $1.1 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2011 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $8.3 billion, including $5 billion purchased in a modified Dutch auction tender offer in December 2011; repayment of long-term debt of $2.5 billion; and payment of dividends of $500 million, offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $10.4 billion, including $7.5 billion issued in November and December 2011, in part, to finance the repurchase of our common stock in the modified Dutch auction tender offer. Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $3.8 billion, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $2.5 billion. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.Contractual ObligationsContractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period Year Years Years YearsContractual obligationsTotal 1 2 and 3 4 and 5 6 and beyondLong-term debt obligations (1) (2)$44,885 $3,601 $4,114 $6,048 $31,122Operating lease obligations741 121 187 146 287Purchase obligations (3)2,921 832 681 393 1,015Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (4)— — — — —Total contractual obligations$48,547 $4,554 $4,982 $6,587 $32,42471(1) Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt issued in 2012 and 2011, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from pounds sterling/euros to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts.(2) Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2012. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations.(3) Purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third-party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.(4) Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2012, are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities.In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred with the acquisition of BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the BioVex contingent consideration, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2012, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $2.5 billion, including $575 million in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. See Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.Product sales and sales deductionsRevenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, “sales deductions”) and returns, which are established at the time of sale.72We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions TotalBalance as of January 1, 2010$707 $128 $135 $970Amounts charged against product sales1,861 2,593 580 5,034Payments(1,724) (2,548) (588) (4,860)Balance as of December 31, 2010844 173 127 1,144Amounts charged against product sales1,795 2,626 670 5,091Payments(1,592) (2,600) (717) (4,909)Balance as of December 31, 20111,047 199 80 1,326Amounts charged against product sales1,480 2,709 659 4,848Payments(1,680) (2,741) (624) (5,045)Balance as of December 31, 2012$847 $167 $115 $1,129For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, total sales deductions were 23%, 25% and 25% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent 3% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2012.In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold.Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. We estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid based on the product sold, contractual terms, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. Additionally, for Medicaid rebates, we consider the estimated patient population and the amount of unbilled managed Medicaid claims. We adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which for certain rebates can take up to one year and more than one year for certain government programs. Rebate accruals totaled $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods were less than 10% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, and less than 5% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. A 10% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2012 would have had an impact of approximately $150 million, or approximately 1% of our 2012 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity.Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Those chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $2.7 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.73Product returnsReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1.5% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant.Income taxesThe Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates.We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.Certain items are included in the Company's tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.The Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Company’s pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Company’s operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020.Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Company’s foreign income associated with the Company’s operations conducted in Puerto Rico.If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results.Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable 74that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies.While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinationsWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:•determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;•projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;•estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and•developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of the various contingent consideration obligations incurred in the acquisition of BioVex (see Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.Impairment of long-lived assetsWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value.Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed primarily of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility, are reviewed annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.75We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.In the capital and credit markets, strong demand for fixed-income instruments led to continued low interest rates on corporate debt issuances during 2012. Short-term interest rates on U.S. Treasury instruments remained near historical lows due to a combination of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies and the challenging macroeconomic environment. As a result, in the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2012 and 2011. Continued uncertainty surrounding European sovereign debt resulted in ongoing volatility in the foreign exchange markets, and we have consequently assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.Interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsOur portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities at December 31, 2012 and 2011, was comprised of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and additionally at December 31, 2012, other short-term interest-bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $23.7 billion and $20.0 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2012 and 2011, would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2012 and 2011, would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year.As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $26.5 billion and a fair value of $29.9 billion. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $21.4 billion and a fair value of $23.0 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011, was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.6 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.1 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts, while outstanding, and cross-currency swap contracts.To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts, which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These derivative contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Due to historically low interest rates, we terminated all of these swap contracts in May 2012. Interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $3.6 billion were outstanding at December 31, 2011. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $200 million on our interest rate swap contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion and $748 million, respectively, that hedge certain of our foreign denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros/pounds sterling and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in approximately a $400 million reduction in the fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts on this date but would have no effect on cash flows or income in the ensuing year. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in approximately a $130 million reduction in the fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts on this date but would have no effect on cash flows or income in the ensuing year.76Foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts.As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with both a carrying value and fair value of $1.5 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $760 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $700 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $290 million on this date with a corresponding reduction in income in the ensuing year, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt.With regard to our $2.7 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros and pound sterling as of December 31, 2012, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on this date, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair value of these contracts of approximately $710 million on this date, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The impact on income in the ensuing year from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical change in the carrying amount of the related hedged debt. With regard to our $748 million notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in pounds sterling as of December 31, 2011, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on this date, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair value of these contracts of approximately $210 million on this date, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The impact on income in the ensuing year from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical change in the carrying amount of the related hedged debt. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2012, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.7 billion and $200 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.5 billion and $292 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the net unrealized gains on these contracts were not material. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2012, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $730 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $350 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2011, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $700 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $330 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $629 million and $389 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2012 and 2011. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2012 and 2011, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have resulted in a material reduction in the fair value of these contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.77Market price sensitive financial instrumentsAs of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, was not material.Counterparty credit risksOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with investment grade credit ratings and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.",2023-12-30 18:05:21.303827
