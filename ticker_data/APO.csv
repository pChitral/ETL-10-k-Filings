1858681,APO,"Apollo Global Management, Inc.",2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a discussion of our liquidity and sources and uses of liquidity, including information about legal and regulatory limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends.The amount of statutory capital that our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have, or that they are required to hold, can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control.The U.S. insurance subsidiaries of our retirement services business are subject to state regulations that provide for minimum capital requirements (“MCR”) based on risk-based capital (“RBC”) formulas for life insurance companies relating to insurance, business, asset, interest rate and certain other risks. Similarly, the Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries of our retirement services business are subject to MCR imposed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”) through the BMA’s Enhanced Capital Requirement (“ECR”) and minimum margin of solvency.In any particular year, our subsidiaries’ capital ratios and/or statutory surplus amounts may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control and some of which we can only partially control, including, but not limited to, the following:•the amount of statutory income or loss generated by our insurance subsidiaries; •the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support their business growth; •changes in reserve requirements applicable to our insurance subsidiaries; •changes in market value of certain securities in our investment portfolio; •recognition of write-downs or other losses on investments held in the investment portfolio of our retirement services business;•changes in the credit ratings of investments held in the investment portfolio of our retirement services business; •changes in the value of certain derivative instruments; •changes in interest rates; •credit market volatility; •changes in policyholder behavior; •changes in corporate tax rates;•changes to the RBC formulas and interpretations of the NAIC instructions with respect to RBC calculation methodologies; and•changes to the ECR, Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (“BSCR”), or target capital level (“TCL”) formulas and interpretations of the BMA’s instructions with respect to ECR, BSCR, or TCL calculation methodologies.Further to NAIC activities with respect to RBC calculation methodologies, the NAIC is pursuing a variety of reforms to its RBC framework, which could increase the capital requirements for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Two examples include the following: (1) a principles-based bond project is underway, which includes consideration of factors to determine whether an 43Table of Contentsinvestment in asset-backed securities qualifies for reporting on an insurer’s statutory financial statement as a bond on Schedule D-1 as opposed to Schedule BA (other long-term invested assets), the latter of which could result, among other things, in the capital charge treatment of the investment being less favorable; and (2) a process to review capital charges on structured securities has commenced as well as the evaluation of private credit rating providers’ rating information and process for privately issued securities purchased by insurers, each of which could increase the level of capital required to be held against these assets.Further to BMA activities with respect to ECR, BSCR or TCL calculation methodologies, on December 8, 2022, the BMA issued a notice that it intends to make enhancements to Bermuda’s regulatory regime for insurers, and on February 24, 2023, the BMA issued a consultation paper on the enhancements it is considering. The consultation period is expected to continue for several months and possibly through the end of 2023. The enhancements are aimed at ensuring that the regime continues to remain fit for purpose, in line with international standards and keeps pace with market developments. While it is too early to predict the ultimate magnitude of the financial impact for our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries, the enhancements (if enacted as currently proposed) would increase the capital requirements for our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries; however, we would expect the impact to be moderated for several reasons, including the fact that we manage capital sufficiency based upon a number of factors, including our internal modeling and analysis of economic risk, inputs from rating agency capital models and consideration of NAIC RBC capital requirements, in addition to Bermuda capital requirements.NRSROs may also implement changes to their internal models, which differ from the RBC and BSCR capital models, that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital our subsidiaries must hold in order to maintain their current ratings. For example, on December 6, 2021, S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) published a Request for Comment (“RFC”) on its methodology and assumptions for analyzing the risk-based capital adequacy of insurers and reinsurers. On May 9, 2022, S&P withdrew its proposed approach due to some of the comments and concerns received. S&P has stated they plan to issue a new RFC once they have finished reviewing the feedback from the initial RFC, likely in the first quarter of 2023. To the extent that one of our insurance subsidiary’s solvency or capital ratios is deemed to be insufficient by one or more NRSROs to maintain their current ratings, we may take actions either to increase the capitalization of the insurer or to reduce the capitalization requirements. If we are unable to accomplish such actions, NRSROs may view this as a reason for a ratings downgrade. If we are unable to accomplish such actions, NRSROs may view this as a reason for a ratings downgrade. Regulatory developments, including the NAIC’s adoption of amendments to its Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Model Regulation requiring, subject to certain exceptions, that our retirement services business file a confidential annual group capital calculation (and likely the results of an annual liquidity stress test) with the Iowa Insurance Division, the lead state insurance regulator of its U.S. insurance subsidiaries, may increase the amount of capital that our retirement services business is required to hold and could result in it being subject to increased regulatory requirements.If a subsidiary’s solvency or capital ratios reach certain minimum levels, it could subject us to further examination or corrective action imposed by our insurance regulators. Corrective actions may include limiting our subsidiaries’ ability to write additional business, increased regulatory supervision, or seizure or liquidation of the subsidiary’s business, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Repurchase agreement programs subject us to potential liquidity and other risks.Our retirement services business may engage in repurchase agreement transactions whereby it sells fixed income securities to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms or commercial banks, with a concurrent agreement to repurchase such securities at a determined future date. These repurchase agreements provide our retirement services business with liquidity and in certain instances also allow it to earn spread income. Under such agreements, our retirement services business may be required to deliver additional securities or cash as margin to the counterparty if the value of the securities sold decreases prior to the repurchase date. If our retirement services business is required to return significant amounts of cash collateral or post cash or securities as margin on short notice or have inadequate cash on hand as of the repurchase date, it may be forced to sell securities to meet such obligations and may have difficulty doing so in a timely manner or may be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than it otherwise would have been able to realize under normal market conditions. Rehypothecation of subject securities by the counterparty may also create risk with respect to the counterparty’s ability to perform its obligations to tender such securities on the repurchase date. Such facilities may not be available to our retirement services business on favorable terms or at all in the future.Our retirement services business is subject to the credit risk of its counterparties, including ceding companies, reinsurers, plan sponsors, and derivative counterparties.44Table of ContentsAthene and its insurance subsidiaries encounter various types of counterparty credit risk. Athene’s insurance subsidiaries cede certain risk to third-party insurance companies that may cover large volumes of business and expose them to a concentration of credit risk with respect to such counterparties. Such subsidiaries may not have a security interest in the underlying assets and despite certain indemnification rights, they retain liability to their policyholders if a counterparty fails to perform. Certain of Athene’s insurance subsidiaries also reinsure liabilities from other insurance companies and these subsidiaries may be negatively impacted by changes in the ceding companies’ ratings, creditworthiness, and market perception, or any policy administration issues. Athene further assumes pension obligations from plan sponsors that expose it to the credit risk of the plan sponsor. In addition, our retirement services business is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by its derivative agreement counterparties. If any of these counterparties is not able to satisfy its obligations to us or third parties, including policyholders, we may not achieve our targeted returns and our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flow may be materially adversely affected.The investment portfolio of our retirement services business may be subject to concentration risk, particularly with respect to single issuers, including Athora, among others; industries, including financial services; and asset classes, including real estate.Our retirement services business faces single issuer concentration risk both in the context of strategic alternative investments, in which it occasionally holds significant equity positions, and large asset trades, in which it generally holds significant debt positions. The most significant concentration risk exposures of our retirement services business arising in the context of strategic alternative investments, on a risk-adjusted basis, is its investment in Athora, an insurance holding company focused on the European life insurance market. Given our retirement services business’ significant exposure to these issuers, it is subject to the risks inherent in their business. For example, as a life insurer, Athora is subject to credit risk with respect to its investment portfolio and mortality risk with respect to its product liabilities, each of which may be exacerbated by unforeseen events. Further, Athora has significant European operations, which expose it to volatile economic conditions and risks relating to European member countries and withdrawals thereof, such as the UK. In addition, Athora is subject to multiple legal and regulatory regimes that may hinder or prevent it from achieving its business objectives. To the extent that our retirement services business suffers a significant loss on its investment in these issuers, including Athora, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.In addition, from time to time, in order to facilitate certain large asset trades and in exchange for commitment fees, our retirement services business may commit to purchasing a larger portion of an investment than it ultimately expects to retain, and in such instances our retirement services business is reliant upon the ability of our asset management business to syndicate the transaction to other investors. If our asset management business is unsuccessful in its syndication efforts, our retirement services business may be exposed to greater concentration risk than what it would deem desirable from a risk appetite perspective and the commitment fee that it receives may not adequately compensate it for this risk.Our retirement services business also has significant investments in nonbank lenders focused on providing financing to individuals or entities. As a result, through these investments, we have significant exposure to credit risk. In addition to the concentration risk arising from our retirement services business’ investments in single issuers within the nonbank lending sector of the financial services industry, we have significant exposure to the financial services industry more broadly as a result of the composition of investments in our retirement services business’ investment portfolio. Economic volatility or any further macroeconomic, regulatory or other changes having an adverse impact on the financial services industry more broadly, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A significant portion of the net invested assets of our retirement services business is invested in real estate-related assets. Any significant decline in the value of real estate generally or the occurrence of any of the risks described elsewhere in this report with respect to the real estate-related investments of our retirement services business could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, through the investments of our retirement services business in CML and CMBS, we have exposure to certain categories of commercial property, including office buildings and retail, that have been adversely affected by the spread of COVID-19 and the work from home trend. In addition, the CML our retirement services business holds, and the CML underlying the CMBS that our retirement services business holds, face both default and delinquency risk.45Table of ContentsConflicts of InterestOur failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses.We increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our business, our investment activities and the investment activities of the funds we manage. As an asset manager, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with investment decisions, including regarding the identification, making, management, valuation, disposition, and timing of a fund’s investments. These conflicts of interest include conflicts that arise among the funds we manage as well as between us and the funds we manage. Certain inherent conflicts of interest arise from the fact that (i) we provide investment management services to more than one fund or client, (ii) the funds we manage often have one or more overlapping investment strategies, and (iii) we could choose to allocate an investment to more than one fund or to ourselves. Also, the investment strategies employed by us for current and future clients, or on our own behalf, could conflict with each other, and may adversely affect the prices and availability of other securities or instruments held by, or potentially considered for, one or more clients. If participation in specific investment opportunities is appropriate for more than one of the funds we manage, participation in such opportunities will be allocated pursuant to our allocation policies and procedures, which take into account the terms of the relevant partnership or investment management agreement as well as the decisions of our allocations committee. In addition to the potential for conflict among the funds we manage, we face the potential for conflict between us and the funds we manage or clients. These conflicts may include: (i) the allocation of investment opportunities between Apollo and the funds Apollo manages; (ii) the allocation of investment opportunities among funds with different performance fee structures, or where our personnel have invested more heavily in one fund than another; (iii) the determination of what constitutes fund-related expenses and the allocation of such expenses between our advised funds and us; and (iv) the ability of our personnel to, in certain circumstances, make investments in the funds we manage or funds managed by third parties on more favorable terms.The documents of the funds we manage typically do not mandate specific allocations with respect to co-investments. The investment advisers of the funds we manage may have an incentive to provide potential co-investment opportunities to certain investors in lieu of others and/or in lieu of an allocation to the funds we manage (including, for example, as part of an investor’s overall strategic relationship with us) if such allocations are expected to generate relatively greater fees or performance allocations to us than would arise if such co-investment opportunities were allocated otherwise. The conflicts of interest stemming from investment allocation decisions are exacerbated by our sponsorship of SPACs. After a SPAC has completed its initial public offering, it has to complete its initial business combination within a predetermined completion window. If a SPAC fails to complete a business combination in the prescribed time, the SPAC is required to redeem the shares of its investors while we and the funds we manage, as the SPAC sponsor, would lose our entire investment. In order to protect our capital, our investment professionals may allocate a potential investment to a SPAC as opposed to a different Apollo managed fund, portfolio company or client, thereby creating a conflict of interest. This conflict of interest will increase as our SPACs get closer to the end of their completion window.The funds we manage invest in portfolio companies whose operations may be substantially similar to and/or competitive with the portfolio companies in which our other funds have invested. The performance and operation of such competing businesses could conflict with and adversely affect the performance and operation of the portfolio companies of the funds we manage, and may adversely affect the prices and availability of business opportunities or transactions available to such portfolio companies. In addition, we may take different actions across funds with similar investment programs, objectives or strategies. For example, one of the private equity funds we manage could have an interest in pursuing an acquisition, divestiture or other transaction, even though the proposed transaction would subject one or more of the investments of the credit funds we manage to additional or increased risks. We may also advise clients with investment objectives or strategies that conflict with those of certain of the funds we manage. We, the funds we manage or the portfolio companies of the funds we manage may also have ongoing relationships with issuers whose securities have been acquired by, or are being considered for investment by us. In addition, a dispute may arise between the portfolio companies of the funds we manage, and the investors in the funds we manage may be dissatisfied with our handling of such dispute.We currently operate without information barriers in our asset management business that some other investment management firms implement to separate business units and/or to separate persons who make investment decisions from others who might possess material non-public information that could influence such decisions. Our executive officers, investment professionals or other employees may acquire confidential or material non-public information and, as a result, they, we, the funds we manage and other clients may be restricted from initiating transactions in certain securities. In the event that any of our employees obtains such material non-public information, we may be restricted in acquiring or disposing of investments on behalf of the 46Table of Contentsfunds we manage, which could impact the returns generated for such funds. Notwithstanding the maintenance of restricted securities lists and other internal controls, it is possible that the internal controls relating to the management of material non-public information could fail and result in us, or one of our investment professionals, buying or selling a security while, at least constructively, in possession of material non-public information. Inadvertent trading on material non-public information could have adverse effects on our reputation, result in the imposition of regulatory or financial sanctions and, as a consequence, negatively impact our ability to provide our investment management services to our clients and the funds we manage. The functions of certain of our affiliates may give rise to a number of conflicts of interest. For example, certain of our affiliates are broker-dealers registered with the SEC and members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) that principally conduct private placements and provide services in respect of the underwriting and syndication of securities, transaction advisory services, including capital markets advisory and structuring services, sourcing services and merger and acquisition advisory services. Additionally, certain of our affiliates and/or portfolio companies of the funds we manage provide a variety of services with respect to financial instruments, including loans, that are not subject to broker-dealer regulations, such as originating, administering, arranging, structuring, placing and syndicating loans, debt advisory and other similar services to the funds we manage and their portfolio companies, as well as third parties. While we believe these kinds of transactions are beneficial to our clients and the funds we manage, the functions that our affiliates may perform give rise to a number of conflicts of interest, including, for example, with respect to the allocation of investment opportunities. In connection with their services to the funds we manage and their portfolio companies, such affiliates and/or the portfolio companies receive fees from the funds we manage, portfolio companies of the funds we manage and third-party borrowers. Consequently, our relationship with these entities may give rise to conflicts of interest between (i) us and portfolio companies of the funds we manage and/or (ii) us and the funds we manage. Additionally, some of our personnel are dual affiliated with other organizations, including our affiliated broker-dealers. Such dual affiliation gives rise to conflicts of interest, including for example with respect to allocation of time, resources, and investment opportunities.Certain of our executive officers and senior investment professionals have established family offices to provide investment advisory, accounting, administrative and other services to their respective family accounts (including certain charitable accounts) in connection with their personal investment activities unrelated to their investments in Apollo entities. The investment activities of the family offices, and the involvement of the executive officer or senior investment professional in these activities may give rise to potential conflicts between the personal financial interests of the executive officer or senior investment professional and the interests of us, any of our subsidiaries or any stockholder other than such executive officer or senior investment professional. From time to time, we finance, securitize or employ structured finance arrangements in respect of certain of our balance sheet assets. We could also employ structured financing arrangements with respect to co-investment interests and investments in other funds made by our entities (including, potentially, co-investments with the funds we manage). These structured financing arrangements could alter our returns and risk exposure with respect to the applicable balance sheet assets as compared to our returns and risk exposure if we held such assets outside of such structured financing arrangements, and could create incentives for us to take actions in respect of such assets that we otherwise would not in the absence of such arrangements or otherwise alter our alignment with investors in such investments. These arrangements could also result in us realizing liquidity with respect to our equity investment in a fund or other entity at a different point in time (including earlier) than the limited partners of such entity.In addition to such finance arrangements, we also opportunistically invest or otherwise deploy the assets on our balance sheet. Such investments may create a platform of businesses directly owned by us, outside of the funds we manage and their portfolio companies or directly owned by the funds we manage. We may be subject to increased conflicts of interest between operating such platform businesses and the funds we manage and their portfolio companies. In addition, certain entities in which Apollo has made a balance sheet investment also may provide services to Apollo, the funds we manage or their portfolio companies, which may give rise to conflicts of interest.In addition, the funds we manage may, subject to applicable requirements in their governing documents, which may include obtaining advisory board consent, determine to sell a particular portfolio investment into a separate vehicle, which may be managed by us, with different terms (i.e., longer duration) than the fund that originally acquired the portfolio investment, and provide limited partners with the option to monetize their investment with the fund at the time of such sale, or to roll all or a portion of their interest in the portfolio investment into a new vehicle. Under such circumstances, we may invest in or alongside the new vehicle, or hold the entirety of the portfolio investment sold by the fund through or alongside the new vehicle (i.e., in the event that all limited partners elect to monetize their investment at the time of sale to the new vehicle). As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise across the funds we manage, limited partners, and us.47Table of ContentsMost of the funds we manage obtain subscription line facilities to facilitate investments and operations, including the payment of fees and expenses. If an investment fund obtains a subscription line facility, the fund’s working capital needs will in most instances be satisfied through borrowings by the fund under the subscription line facility, and, less so, by drawdowns of capital contributions by the fund. As a result, capital calls are expected to be conducted in larger amounts on a less frequent basis in order to, among other things, repay borrowings and related interest expenses due under such subscription line facilities.Where an investment fund uses borrowings under a subscription line facility in advance or in lieu of receiving capital contributions from investors to repay any such borrowings and related interest expenses, the use of such facility will result in a different (and perhaps higher) reported internal rate of return than if the facility had not been utilized and instead capital contributions from investors had been contributed at the inception of an investment. This may present conflicts of interest. Because the preferred return of investment funds typically does not accrue on such borrowings, but rather only accrues on capital contributions when made, the use of such subscription line facilities may reduce or eliminate the preferred return received by the investors and accelerate or increase distributions of performance-based allocation to the relevant general partner. This will provide the general partner with an economic incentive to fund investments through such facilities in lieu of capital contributions. However, since interest expense and other costs of borrowings under subscription lines of credit are an expense of the investment fund, the investment fund’s incurred expenses will be increased, which may reduce the amount of performance fees generated by the fund. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation which would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.Risks Related to Regulation and LitigationExtensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens on our businesses.We are subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations and requirements to obtain and maintain licenses and/or other approvals, by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Many of the various laws and regulations to which we are subject are discussed in “Item 1. Business—Regulatory and Compliance Matters.” As detailed in that section, certain of our businesses, subsidiaries and/or affiliates are, among others, regulated under the Investment Advisers Act; the Investment Company Act; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive; the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive; the EU General Data Protection Regulation; the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018; the Cayman Data Protection Law; the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018; the Regulation on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories; as well as by the Financial Stability Oversight Council; the Federal Reserve; the SEC; FINRA; the U.S. Department of Labor; the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”); the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; the Federal Communications Commission; insurance regulators in U.S. states, the EU, Bermuda, U.K., Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, Singapore, Canada, Cayman Islands, Malaysia, South Korea and Hong Kong; banking regulators in Germany, Slovenia and Spain; as well as rules and regulations regarding CLO risk retention, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers, “over the counter” derivatives markets, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, gaming companies, and natural resources companies. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing payments and contributions to public officials or other parties, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as economic sanctions and export control laws administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State. Increasingly, we are or may be subject to new initiatives and additional rules and regulations relating to ESG matters, including but not limited to: in the EU, the EU Regulation on the Establishment of a Framework to Facilitate Sustainable Investment as well as the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and supporting regulatory technical standards; and, in the U.K., the U.K. FCA’s disclosure rules for asset managers aligned with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures as well as the forthcoming Sustainability Disclosure Requirements and investment labelling regime and the proposed U.K. Green Taxonomy. Compliance with such laws and regulations requires increasing amounts of resources and the attention of our management team. Any violation, even if alleged, of such laws and regulations or any failure to obtain or maintain licenses and/or other regulatory approvals as required for our operations may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and prospects. 48Table of ContentsMany of these laws and regulations empower regulators, including U.S. and foreign government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions and insurance departments in the U.S., to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that can result in penalties, fines, suspensions or revocations of licenses and/or other regulatory approvals, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including censure, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, enforcement actions and settlements, or the suspension or expulsion of an investment adviser from registration or memberships. Even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator is small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing investors or fail to gain new investors. These requirements imposed by our regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in the funds we manage and policyholders of our retirement services and other businesses and may not necessarily be designed to protect our stockholders. Other regulations, such as those promulgated by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and similar foreign direct investment regimes in other jurisdictions, may impair our ability to invest the funds we manage and/or for such funds to realize full value from our investments in certain industries and countries. Our businesses may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by U.S. or foreign government agencies or self-regulatory organizations. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these government agencies and self-regulatory organizations. The financial services industry is the focus of increased regulatory scrutiny as various U.S. state and federal government agencies and self-regulatory organizations conduct inquiries and investigations into the products and practices of the industry. Government agencies and insurance standard setters in the U.S. and worldwide have also become increasingly interested in potential risks posed by the insurance industry as a whole, and to commercial and financial activities and systems in general, as indicated by the development of ComFrame, which will be applicable to IAIGs designated by their group-wide supervisor and includes a group capital requirement in addition to the current legal entity capital requirements and any group capital requirements imposed by relevant insurance laws and regulations. We expect that we and/or one or more of our affiliates will be designated as an IAIG in 2023. In the event that we or any of our affiliates become an IAIG, we expect to ultimately be subject to the relevant group capital standard that applies to U.S.-headquartered IAIGs. We cannot fully predict with certainty the impact (if any) on our capital position and capital structure and any other burdens being named an IAIG may impose on us and/or our affiliates. Consequently, we may be subject to new, divergent, conflicting, increasingly severe regulations and restrictions on our business that could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and prospects.We are subject to third-party litigation from time to time that could result in significant liabilities and reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The activities of our businesses, including the investment activities of the funds we manage and activities of our employees in connection with the funds, their portfolio companies, our insurance subsidiaries, as well as publicly listed vehicles we manage or sponsor, including SPACs, may subject us and certain of our employees to the risk of litigation by third parties, including fund investors dissatisfied with the performance or management of such funds, holders of our or the funds’ portfolio companies’ debt or equity, policyholders of our retirement services business, public stockholders, and investors in the SPACs we sponsor and a variety of other potential litigants. In general, we will be exposed to risk of litigation by our investors if our management of any fund is alleged to constitute bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, willful or reckless disregard for our duties to the fund, breach of fiduciary duties or securities laws, or other forms of misconduct. If such allegations are made against our Board or management, Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) allows stockholders to access corporate books and records to investigate wrongdoing. Fund investors could sue us to recover amounts lost by the funds we manage due to our alleged misconduct, up to the entire amount of loss. Further, we may be subject to litigation arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of the funds we manage or from third-party allegations that we (i) improperly exercised control or influence over companies in which the funds we manage have large investments or (ii) are liable for actions or inactions taken by portfolio companies that such third parties argue we control. We are also exposed to risks of litigation or investigation relating to transactions that presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed. Our rights to indemnification by the funds we manage may not be upheld if challenged, and our indemnification rights generally do not cover bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, willful or reckless disregard for our duties to the fund or other forms of misconduct. With many highly paid investment professionals and complex compensation and incentive arrangements, we face the risk of lawsuits relating to claims for compensation, which may individually or in the aggregate be significant in amount. We are also increasingly faced with the risk of litigation or investigation in relation to ESG-related issues given the increasing scrutiny of such issues by investors, other stakeholders, regulators, and other third parties as well as due to the increasing disclosure obligations on our businesses, the funds we manage, and their portfolio companies. Such risks may relate to accusations concerning but not limited to: (i) the activities of portfolio companies, including environmental damage and violations of labor and human rights; (ii) misrepresentations of the investment strategies of the funds we manage as well as about our, the funds’, and their investments’ performance against ESG-49Table of Contentsrelated measures and/or ESG initiatives; or (iii) breaches of fiduciary duty in relation to the funds we manage and other violations of law related to the management of ESG risks.If any civil or criminal litigation brought against us were to result in a finding of substantial legal liability or culpability, the litigation could, in addition to any financial damage, cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage levels against potential liabilities we may face in connection with potential claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Risks Related to TaxationOur structure involves complex provisions of tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure is also subject to ongoing future potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.The tax treatment of our structure and transactions undertaken by us depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. In addition, U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies, which frequently results in revised interpretations of established concepts, statutory changes, revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations. It is possible that future legislation increases the U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to corporations, limits further the deductibility of interest, subjects carried interest to more onerous taxation or effects other changes that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). The IRA contains a number of tax-related provisions, including a 15% minimum corporate income tax on certain large corporations as well as an excise tax on stock repurchases. It is unclear how the IRA will be implemented by the U.S. Department of the Treasury through regulation. We are still evaluating the impact of the IRA on our tax liability, which tax liability could also be affected by how the provisions of the IRA are implemented through such regulation. We will continue to evaluate the IRA’s impact as further information becomes available.We cannot predict whether any particular proposed legislation will be enacted or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be, or whether it would have any effect on us. As such, we cannot assure you that future legislative, administrative or judicial developments will not result in an increase in the amount of U.S. or non-U.S. tax payable by us, the funds we manage, portfolio companies owned by such funds or by investors in our shares. If any such developments occur, our business, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected and such developments could have an adverse effect on your investment in our shares.Our effective tax rate and tax liability is based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations and treaties. These laws, regulations and treaties are complex, and the manner which they apply to us and the funds we manage is sometimes open to interpretation. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Although management believes its application of current laws, regulations and treaties to be correct and sustainable upon examination by the tax authorities, the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation resulting in additional tax liability or adjustment to our income tax provision that could increase our effective tax rate.In addition, we or certain portfolio companies of the funds we manage are currently (or have been recently) under tax audit in various jurisdictions, including the U.S., India, and the U.K., and these jurisdictions or any others where we conduct business may assess additional tax against us. While we believe our tax positions, determinations, and calculations are reasonable, the final determination of tax upon resolution of any audits could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional material taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment, or litigation, there could be an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.The U.S. Congress, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”) and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates invest or conduct business have continued to recommend and implement changes related to the taxation of multinational companies. The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project, 50Table of Contentswhich is focused on a number of issues, including profit shifting among affiliated entities in different jurisdictions, interest deductibility and eligibility for the benefits of double tax treaties. Several of the proposed measures, including measures covering treaty abuse, the deductibility of interest expense, local nexus requirements, transfer pricing and hybrid mismatch arrangements are potentially relevant to some of the fund structures and could have an adverse tax impact on the funds we manage, investors and/or the portfolio companies of the funds we manage. Some member countries have been moving forward on the BEPS agenda but, because timing of implementation and the specific measures adopted will vary among participating states, significant uncertainty remains regarding the impact of BEPS proposals. As a result, uncertainty remains around the access to tax treaties for some of the investments’ holding platforms, which could create situations of double taxation and adversely impact the investment returns of the funds we manage.In addition, the OECD is continuing to work on a two pillar initiative, “BEPS 2.0,” which is aimed at (1) shifting taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer (“Pillar One”) and (2) ensuring all companies pay a global minimum tax (“Pillar Two”). Pillar One will, broadly, re-allocate taxing rights over 25% of the residual profits of multinational enterprises (“MNEs”) with global turnover in excess of 20 billion euros (excluding extractives and regulated financial services) to the jurisdictions where the customers and users of those MNEs are located. Pillar Two will, broadly, consist of two interlocking domestic rules (together the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (the “GloBE Rules”)): (i) an Income Inclusion Rule (“IIR”), which imposes top-up tax on a parent entity in respect of the low-taxed income of a constituent entity; and (ii) an Undertaxed Payment Rule, which denies deductions or requires an equivalent adjustment to the extent the low-taxed income of a constituent entity is not subject to tax under an IIR. There will also be a treaty-based Subject To Tax Rule that allows source jurisdictions to impose limited source taxation on certain related party payments subject to tax below a minimum rate.For countries other than the U.S., the OECD recommended model GloBE Rules for Pillar Two in late 2021. The OECD also released further guidance on the model GloBE Rules during 2022 and is expected to continue to release guidance on a rolling basis throughout 2023. This includes the release in early February 2023 of further technical guidance which comments in particular on the interaction between the model GloBE Rules and current U.S. tax law. It was indicated by the OECD in May 2022 that the Two-Pillar Solution will not come into force until 2024 at the earliest.Several aspects of the model GloBE Rules, including whether some or all of our activities may fall within the scope of the exclusions therefrom, currently remain unclear or uncertain notwithstanding existing commentary and draft legislation. The United Kingdom released draft legislation in July 2022 seeking to implement the IIR via a “multinational top-up tax” and has stated an intention that this tax will apply to multinational enterprises for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. It is possible that other countries or jurisdictions may implement the recommended model GloBE Rules as drafted, in a modified form, or not at all. The content of future OECD guidance and its consistency with current international tax principles is currently unclear. Additionally, the timing, scope and implementation of any of these provisions into domestic law also remains subject to significant uncertainty. Depending on how the model GloBE Rules are implemented or clarified by additional commentary or guidance in the future, they may result in material additional tax being payable.Changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax law could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from certain investors.Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), certain U.S. withholding agents, foreign financial institutions (“FFIs”), and non-financial foreign entities, are required to report information about offshore accounts and investments to the U.S. or their local taxing authorities annually or be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax on certain U.S. payments. The reporting obligations imposed under FATCA require FFIs to comply with agreements with the IRS to obtain and disclose information about certain investors to the IRS. The administrative and economic costs of compliance with FATCA may discourage some investors from investing in U.S. funds, which could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from these investors. Other countries, such as the U.K., Luxembourg, and the Cayman Islands, have implemented regimes similar to that of FATCA. The OECD has also developed the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) for exchange of information pursuant to which many countries have now signed multilateral agreements. Rules and regulations are currently and will continue to be introduced (particularly pursuant to the EU “Directive on Administrative Co-Operation”, or “DAC 6”, and the OECD’s model Mandatory Disclosure Rules) which require the reporting to tax authorities of information about certain types of arrangements, including arrangements which may circumvent the CRS. Compliance with CRS and other similar regimes could result in increased administrative and compliance costs and could subject our investment entities to increased non-U.S. withholding taxes.Our non-U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation in an amount greater than expected.51Table of ContentsOur non-U.S. subsidiaries (including AHL) are treated as foreign corporations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (such subsidiaries, the “Non-U.S. Companies”). Each of the Non-U.S. Companies currently intends to operate in a manner that will not cause it to be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net basis in any material amount. However, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether a foreign corporation is engaged in a trade or business (or has a permanent establishment) in the U.S., as the law is unclear and the determination is highly factual and must be made annually, and therefore there can be no assurance that the IRS will not successfully contend that a Non-U.S. Company that does not intend to be treated as engaged in a trade or business (or as having a permanent establishment) in the U.S. does, in fact, so engage (or have such a permanent establishment). If any such Non-U.S. Company is treated as engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. (or as having a permanent establishment), it may incur greater tax costs than expected on any income not exempt from taxation under an applicable income tax treaty, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.AHL is currently a UK tax resident and expects to qualify for the benefits under the income tax treaty between the U.S. and the UK (the “UK Treaty”) because its common shares are owned by AGM, the common shares of which are listed and regularly traded on the NYSE. In addition, certain of AHL’s subsidiaries treated as resident in the UK for UK tax purposes (“UK Resident Companies”) expect to qualify for the benefits of the UK Treaty by reason of being subsidiaries of AGM or by reason of satisfying an ownership and base erosion test. Accordingly, AHL and the UK Resident Companies are expected to qualify for certain exemptions from, or reduced rates of, the U.S. taxes described above that are provided for by the UK Treaty. However, there can be no assurances that AHL and the UK Resident Companies will continue to qualify for treaty benefits or satisfy all of the requirements for the tax exemptions and reductions they intend to claim. If AHL or any of the UK Resident Companies fails to qualify for such benefits or satisfy such requirements, it may incur greater tax costs than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (“BEAT”) may significantly increase our tax liability.The BEAT operates as a minimum tax and is generally calculated as a percentage (10% for taxable years before 2026 and 12.5% thereafter) of the “modified taxable income” of an “applicable taxpayer.” Modified taxable income is calculated by adding back to a taxpayer’s regular taxable income the amount of certain “base erosion tax benefits” with respect to certain payments made to foreign affiliates of the taxpayer, as well as the “base erosion percentage” of any net operating loss deductions. The BEAT applies for a taxable year only to the extent it exceeds a taxpayer’s regular corporate income tax liability for such year (determined without regard to certain tax credits).Certain reinsurance agreements of our retirement services business require certain of our U.S. subsidiaries (including any non-U.S. subsidiaries subject to U.S. federal income taxation) to pay or accrue substantial amounts to certain of our non-U.S. reinsurance subsidiaries that would be characterized as “base erosion payments” with respect to which there are “base erosion tax benefits.” These and any other “base erosion payments” may cause us to be subject to the BEAT. In addition, tax authorities may disagree with our BEAT calculations, or the interpretations on which those calculations are based, and assess additional taxes, interest and penalties. We will establish our tax provision in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, there can be no assurance that this provision will accurately reflect the amount of U.S. federal income tax that we ultimately pay, as that amount could differ materially from the estimate. There may be material adverse consequences to our business if tax authorities successfully challenge our BEAT calculations, in light of the uncertainties described above.Changes in U.S. tax law might adversely affect demand for our retirement services products.Many of the products that our retirement services business sells and reinsures benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current U.S. federal and state income tax regimes. For example, our retirement services business sells and reinsures annuity contracts that allow the policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. Future changes in U.S. federal or state tax law could reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of such products, which could affect the sale of retirement services’ products or increase the expected lapse rate with respect to products that have already been sold. Decreases in product sales or increases in lapse rates, in either case, brought about by changes in U.S. tax law, may result in a decrease in net invested assets and therefore investment income and may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.There is U.S. income tax risk associated with reinsurance between U.S. insurance companies and their Bermuda affiliates.52Table of ContentsIf a reinsurance agreement is entered into among related parties, the IRS is permitted to reallocate or recharacterize income, deductions or certain other items, and to make any other adjustment, to reflect the proper amount, source or character of the taxable income of each of the parties. If the IRS were to successfully challenge our reinsurance arrangements, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.Our Bermuda subsidiaries are subject to the risk that Bermuda tax laws may change and that they may become subject to new Bermuda taxes following the expiration of a current exemption after 2035.The Bermuda Minister of Finance, under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda, as amended, has given certain of our subsidiaries assurance that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to our subsidiaries or any of our operations, shares, debentures or other obligations until March 31, 2035, except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda or to any taxes payable by our subsidiaries in respect of real property owned or leased by our subsidiaries in Bermuda. Given the limited duration of the Bermuda Minister of Finance’s assurance, we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will not be subject to any Bermuda tax after March 31, 2035.Risks Related to Our Common SharesThe market price and trading volume of our shares may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.The market price of our shares may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. You may be unable to resell your shares at or above your purchase price, if at all. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our shares or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our shares include: variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends, which variations we expect will be substantial; our policy of taking a long-term perspective on making investment, operational and strategic decisions, which is expected to result in significant and unpredictable variations in our quarterly returns; our creditworthiness, results of operations and financial condition; the credit ratings of the shares; the prevailing interest rates or rates of return being paid by other companies similar to us and the market for similar securities; failure to meet analysts’ earnings estimates; publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our shares; additions or departures of key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future; actions by stockholders; changes in market valuations of similar companies; speculation in the press or investment community; changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our businesses or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; a lack of liquidity in the trading of our shares; adverse publicity about the investment management industry generally or individual scandals, specifically; a breach of our computer systems, software or networks, or misappropriation of our proprietary information; and economic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events or conditions that affect us or the financial markets.An investment in our shares is not an investment in any of the funds we manage, and the assets and revenues of such funds are not directly available to us.Our shares are securities of Apollo Global Management, Inc. only. While our historical consolidated and combined financial information includes financial information, including assets and revenues of certain funds we manage on a consolidated basis, and our future financial information will continue to consolidate certain of these funds, such assets and revenues are available to the fund, and not to us except through management fees, performance fees, distributions and other proceeds arising from agreements with funds, as discussed in more detail in this report.Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain legal actions between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, and the enforceability of the exclusive forum provision may be subject to uncertainty.Article XIV of our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a 53Table of Contentsfiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, other employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders; (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (a) through (d) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. The exclusive forum provision also provides that it will not apply to claims arising under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws for which there is exclusive federal or concurrent federal and state jurisdiction. Stockholders cannot waive, and will not be deemed to have waived under the exclusive forum provision, the Company’s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Although we believe this exclusive forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, this exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Further, in the event a court finds the exclusive forum provision contained in the Certificate of Incorporation to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.Declaration, payment and amounts of dividends, if any, to holders of our shares will be uncertain.It is expected that we will continue to pay an annual dividend on our common stock, with increases based on the growth of the business as determined by our board of directors. The amount of dividends, if any, that are declared or paid to our stockholders, depends on a number of factors. Our board of directors will have sole discretion to determine whether any dividends will be declared, when dividends, if any, are declared, and the amount of such dividends. We expect that such determination would be based on a number of considerations, including our results of operations and capital management plans and the market price of our shares, the availability of funds, our access to capital markets as well as industry practice and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors, such as insurance regulatory requirements applicable to our subsidiaries. In addition, our ability to pay dividends and the amount of any dividends ultimately paid in respect of our shares will, in each case, be subject to receiving funds, directly or indirectly, from our operating subsidiaries, AAM and AHL. Furthermore, the ability of these operating subsidiaries to make distributions to us will depend on satisfying applicable law with respect to such distributions and making prior distributions on the AAM and AHL outstanding preferred stock, and the ability of AAM and AHL to receive distributions from their own respective subsidiaries will continue to depend on applicable law with respect to such distributions. There can be no guarantee that our stockholders will receive or be entitled to dividends commensurate with the historical dividends of AAM.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESOur principal executive offices are located in leased office space at 9 West 57th Street, New York, New York 10019.

Apollo does not own any real property. In our retirement services business, Athene owns its headquarters for U.S. operations, which is located in West Des Moines, Iowa and leases its head office for Bermuda operations, which is located in Hamilton, Bermuda. The retirement services business includes Athene’s Iowa and Bermuda offices. The Company considers these facilities to be suitable and adequate for the management and operation of its businesses.54Table of ContentsITEM 3.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESOur common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “APO.”The number of holders of record of our common stock as of February 24, 2023 was 291. This does not include the number of stockholders that hold stock in “street name” through banks or broker-dealers. Stock Performance GraphThe following graph depicts the total return to holders of our common stock from the closing price on December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2022, relative to the performance of the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Asset Managers Index. The graph assumes $100 invested on December 31, 2017 and dividends received reinvested in the security or index.The performance graph is not intended to be indicative of future performance. The performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of the Company’s filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.Cash Dividend PolicyThe quarterly cash dividend previously paid to our common stockholders can be found in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. We have also declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock in respect to the fourth quarter of 2022 which will be paid on February 28, 2023 to holders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2023.Our current intention is to pay an annual cash dividend of $1.72 per share of common stock. The declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, which may change the dividend policy at any time, including, without limitation, to eliminate the dividend entirely, and will depend upon many factors, including general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our businesses and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and obligations, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, restrictions and other implications on the payment of dividends by us or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. Because AGM is a holding company, the primary source of 56Table of Contentsfunds for AGM’s dividends are distributions from its operating subsidiaries, AAM and AHL. Furthermore, the ability of these operating subsidiaries to make distributions to AGM will depend on satisfying applicable law with respect to such distributions and making prior distributions on the AAM and AHL outstanding preferred stock, and the ability of AAM and AHL to receive distributions from their own respective subsidiaries will continue to depend on applicable law with respect to such distributions. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Common Shares—Declaration, payment and amounts of dividends, if any, to holders of our shares will be uncertain.”Under the DGCL we may only pay dividends to our stockholders out of (i) our surplus, as defined and computed under the provisions of the DGCL or (ii) our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Subject to the rights of the holders of preferred shares, if any, and applicable law, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, declare, make and pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Instruments governing indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries incur in the future may contain restrictions on our or our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other cash distributions to equity holders.Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation PlansSee the table under “Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans” set forth in “Item 12.

These equity-based awards are granted under the Company's Equity Plan. To prevent dilution on account of these awards, Apollo may, in its discretion, repurchase shares of common stock on the open market and retire them. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 40,456 shares of common stock at an average price paid per share of $63.40 in open-market transactions not pursuant to a publicly-announced repurchase plan or program on account of these awards. 2 Represents repurchases of shares of common stock in order to offset the dilutive impact of share issuances under the Equity Plan, including reductions of shares of common stock that otherwise would have been issued to participants under the Company’s Equity Plan in order to satisfy associated tax obligations.3 Pursuant to a share repurchase program that was publicly announced on January 3, 2022, the Company is authorized to repurchase (i) up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion of shares of its common stock in order to opportunistically reduce its share count and (ii) up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion of shares of its common stock in order to offset the dilutive impact of share issuances under the its equity incentive plans, in each case with the timing and amount of repurchases to depend on a variety of factors, including price, economic and market conditions as well as expected capital needs, evolution in Company’s capital structure, legal requirements and other factors. Under the share repurchase program, repurchases may be of outstanding shares of common stock occurring from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise, as well as through reductions of shares that otherwise would have been issued to participants under the Company’s Equity Plan in order to satisfy associated tax obligations. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at any specific time. The program is effective until the aggregate repurchase amount that has been approved by the AGM board of directors has been expended. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. ITEM 6. [RESERVED]58Table of ContentsITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Apollo Global Management, Inc.’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those included in the section of this report entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” The highlights listed below have had significant effects on many items within our consolidated financial statements and affect the comparison of the current period’s activity with those of prior periods. Target returns included in this report are presented gross and do not account for fees, expenses and taxes, which will reduce returns. Target returns are neither guarantees nor predictions or projections of future performance. There can be no assurance that target returns will be achieved or that Apollo will be successful in implementing the applicable strategy. Actual gross and net returns for funds managed by Apollo, and individual investors participating directly or indirectly in funds managed by Apollo, may vary significantly from the target returns set forth herein.GeneralOur BusinessesFounded in 1990, Apollo is a high-growth, global alternative asset manager and a retirement services provider. Apollo conducts its business primarily in the United States through the following three reportable segments: Asset Management, Retirement Services and Principal Investing. These business segments are differentiated based on the investment services they provide as well as varying investing strategies. As of December 31, 2022, Apollo had a team of 2,540 employees and Athene had 1,718 employees.Asset ManagementOur Asset Management segment focuses on three investing strategies: yield, hybrid and equity. We have a flexible mandate in many of the funds we manage which enables the funds to invest opportunistically across a company’s capital structure. We raise, invest and manage funds, accounts and other vehicles on behalf of some of the world’s most prominent pension, endowment and sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies, as well as other institutional and individual investors. As of December 31, 2022, we had total AUM of $547.6 billion. The yield, hybrid and equity investing strategies of our Asset Management segment reflect the range of investment capabilities across our platform based on relative risk and return. As an asset manager, we earn fees for providing investment management services and expertise to our client base. The amount of fees charged for managing these assets depends on the underlying investment strategy, liquidity profile, and, ultimately, our ability to generate returns for our clients. We also earn capital solutions fees as part of our growing capital solutions business and as part of monitoring and deployment activity alongside our sizeable private equity franchise. After expenses, we call the resulting earnings stream “Fee Related Earnings” or “FRE”, which represents the primary performance measure for the Asset Management segment.YieldYield is our largest asset management strategy with $392.5 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2022. Our yield strategy focuses on generating excess returns through high-quality credit underwriting and origination. Beyond participation in the traditional issuance and secondary credit markets, through our origination platforms and corporate solutions capabilities we seek to originate attractive and safe-yielding assets for the investors in the funds we manage. Within our yield strategy, we target 4% to 10% returns for our clients. Since inception, the total return yield fund has generated a 5% gross Return on Equity (“ROE”) and 4% net ROE annualized through December 31, 2022.HybridOur hybrid strategy, with $56.4 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2022, brings together our capabilities across debt and equity to seek to offer a differentiated risk-adjusted return with an emphasis on structured downside protected opportunities across asset classes. We target 8% to 15% returns within our hybrid strategy by pursuing investments in all market environments, deploying capital during both periods of dislocation and market strength, and focusing on different investing 59Table of Contentsstrategies and asset classes. The flagship hybrid credit hedge fund we manage has generated an 11% gross ROE and a 7% net ROE annualized and the hybrid value funds we manage have generated a 21% gross IRR and a 16% net IRR from inception through December 31, 2022. EquityOur equity strategy manages $98.8 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2022. Our equity strategy emphasizes flexibility, complexity, and purchase price discipline to drive opportunistic-like returns for our clients throughout market cycles. Apollo’s equity team has experience across sectors, industries, and geographies in both private equity and real estate equity. Our control equity transactions are principally buyouts, corporate carveouts and distressed investments, while the real estate funds we manage generally transact in single asset, portfolio and platform acquisitions. Within our equity strategy, we target upwards of 15% returns in the funds we manage. We have consistently produced attractive long-term investment returns in the traditional private equity funds we manage, generating a 39% gross IRR and a 24% net IRR on a compound annual basis from inception through December 31, 2022.Retirement Services Our retirement services business is conducted by Athene, a leading financial services company that specializes in issuing, reinsuring and acquiring retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs. Athene’s primary product line is annuities, which include fixed, payout and group annuities issued in conjunction with pension group annuity transactions, as well as a newly launched variable annuity product without guarantees. Athene also offers funding agreements, which are comprised of funding agreements issued under its FABN and FABR programs, funding agreements issued to the FHLB and repurchase agreements with an original maturity exceeding one year. Our asset management business provides a full suite of services for Athene’s investment portfolio, including direct investment management, asset allocation, merger and acquisition asset diligence and certain operational support services, including investment compliance, tax, legal and risk management support. Our retirement services business focuses on generating spread income by combining the two core competencies of (1) sourcing long-term, persistent liabilities and (2) using the global scale and reach of our asset management business to actively source or originate assets with Athene’s preferred risk and return characteristics. Athene’s investment philosophy is to invest a portion of its assets in securities that earn an incremental yield by taking measured liquidity and complexity risk and capitalizing on its long-dated funding profile to prudently achieve higher net investment earned rates, rather than assuming incremental credit risk. A cornerstone of Athene’s investment philosophy is that given the operating leverage inherent in its business, modest investment outperformance can translate to outsized return performance. Because Athene maintains discipline in underwriting attractively priced liabilities, it has the ability to invest in a broad range of high-quality assets to generate attractive earnings.Principal Investing Our Principal Investing segment is comprised of our realized performance fee income, realized investment income from our balance sheet investments, and certain allocable expenses related to corporate functions supporting the entire company. The Principal Investing segment also includes our growth capital and liquidity resources at AGM. We expect to deploy capital into strategic investments over time that will help accelerate the growth of our Asset Management segment, by broadening our investment management and/or product distribution capabilities or increasing the efficiency of our operations. We believe these investments will translate into greater compounded annual growth of Fee Related Earnings.Given the cyclical nature of performance fees, earnings from our Principal Investing segment, or Principal Investing Income (“PII”), is inherently more volatile in nature than earnings from the Asset Management and Retirement Services segments. We earn fees based on the investment performance of the funds we manage and compensate our employees, primarily investment professionals, with a meaningful portion of these proceeds to align our team with the investors in the funds we manage and incentivize them to deliver strong investment performance over time. We expect to increase the proportion of performance fee income we pay to our employees over time, and as such proportion increases, we expect PII to represent a relatively smaller portion of our total company earnings. 60Table of ContentsThe diagram below depicts our current organizational structure:Note: The organizational structure chart above depicts a simplified version of the Apollo structure. It does not include all legal entities in the structure. (1)Includes direct and indirect ownership by AGM.Business Environment Economic and Market ConditionsOur asset management and retirement services businesses are affected by the condition of global financial markets and the economy. Price fluctuations within equity, credit, commodity, foreign exchange markets, as well as interest rates and global inflation, which may be volatile and mixed across geographies, can significantly impact the performance of our business, including, but not limited to, the valuation of investments, including those of the funds we manage, and related income we may recognize. We carefully monitor economic and market conditions that could potentially give rise to global market volatility and affect our business operations, investment portfolios and derivatives, which includes global inflation. Adverse economic conditions may result from domestic and global economic and political developments, including plateauing or decreasing economic growth and business activity, civil unrest, geopolitical tensions or military action, such as the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia and corresponding sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries, and new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements on business investment, hiring, migration, labor supply and global supply chains.U.S. inflation remained heightened during the fourth quarter of 2022, and the U.S. Federal Reserve continued its interest rate hiking cycle as a result. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the annual U.S. inflation rate decreased to 6.5% as of December 31, 2022, compared to 7.0% as of December 31, 2021, and 8.2% as of September 30, 2022, as action from the U.S. Federal Reserve is beginning to temper inflation. While beginning to decline, the heightened U.S. inflation rate remains persistent due to a combination of supply and demand factors. As a result, in December 2022, the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate to a target range of 4.25% to 4.50%, up from a target range of 0% to 0.25% in 2021, which marked the seventh consecutive interest rate hike in 2022. In the U.S., the S&P 500 Index decreased by 19.4% in 2022, following an increase of 26.9% in 2021. Global equity markets decreased similarly in 2022, with the MSCI All Country World ex USA Index decreasing 13.8%, following an increase of 13.2% in 2021. 61Table of ContentsConditions in the credit markets have a significant impact on our business. Credit markets were negative in 2022, with the BofAML HY Master II Index decreasing by 11.2%, while the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index decreased by 0.6%. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield ended the year at 3.9%. In terms of economic conditions in the U.S., the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.1% in 2022, following an increase of 5.9% in 2021. As of January 2023, the International Monetary Fund estimated that the U.S. economy will expand by 1.4% in 2023 and 1.0% in 2024. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 3.5% as of December 31, 2022.Foreign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments and those of the funds we manage as well as Athene’s liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar weakened in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the euro and the British pound as global central banks worked to combat the increasing yield disparity. Relative to the U.S. dollar, the euro depreciated 5.9% during 2022, after depreciating 6.9% in 2021, while the British pound depreciated 10.7% during 2022, after depreciating 1.0% in 2021. Oil moves also moderated, ending 2022 up 6.7%, after appreciating by 55.0% during 2021, amid a volatile year which included recession fears that counteracted constrained supply and oil export disruptions driven by the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.We are actively monitoring the developments in Ukraine resulting from the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the economic sanctions and restrictions imposed against Russia, Belarus, and certain Russian and Belarussian entities and individuals. The Company continues to (i) identify and assess any exposure to designated persons or entities across the Company’s business; (ii) ensure existing surveillance and controls are calibrated to the evolving sanctions; and (iii) ensure appropriate levels of communication across the Company, and with other relevant market participants, as appropriate.As of December 31, 2022, the funds we manage have no investments that would cause Apollo or any Apollo managed fund to be in violation of current international sanctions, and we believe the direct exposure of investment portfolios of the funds we manage to Russia and Ukraine is insignificant. The Company and the funds we manage do not intend to make any new material investments in Russia, and have appropriate controls in place to ensure review of any new exposure. Institutional investors continue to allocate capital towards alternative investment managers for more attractive risk-adjusted returns in a low interest rate environment, and we believe the business environment remains generally accommodative to raise larger successor funds, launch new products, and pursue attractive strategic growth opportunities. Interest Rate EnvironmentRates moved meaningfully higher than most predictions for 2022, and this trend continued in the fourth quarter with the U.S. 10-year Treasury reaching levels as high as 4.25% during the quarter. Given the Federal Reserve’s continued focus on curbing inflation and recessionary concerns, it is difficult to predict the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve.With respect to Retirement Services, Athene’s investment portfolio consists predominantly of fixed maturity investments. If prevailing interest rates were to rise, we believe the yield on Athene’s new investment purchases may also rise and Athene’s investment income from floating rate investments would increase, while the value of Athene’s existing investments may decline. If prevailing interest rates were to decline significantly, the yield on Athene’s new investment purchases may decline and Athene’s investment income from floating rate investments would decrease, while the value of Athene’s existing investments may increase. Athene addresses interest rate risk through managing the duration of the liabilities it sources with assets it acquires through asset liability management (“ALM”) modeling. As part of its investment strategy, Athene purchases floating rate investments, which are expected to perform well in a rising interest rate environment, as was experienced in 2022, and are expected to underperform in a declining rate environment. As of December 31, 2022, Athene’s net invested asset portfolio included $39.3 billion of floating rate investments, or 20% of its net invested assets and its net reserve liabilities included $14.2 billion of floating rate liabilities at notional, or 7% of its net invested assets, resulting in $25.1 billion of net floating rate assets, or 13% of its net invested assets. If prevailing interest rates were to rise, we believe Athene’s products would be more attractive to consumers and its sales would likely increase. If prevailing interest rates were to decline, it is likely that Athene’s products would be less attractive to consumers and Athene’s sales would likely decrease. In periods of prolonged low interest rates, the net investment spread may be negatively impacted by reduced investment income to the extent that Athene is unable to adequately reduce policyholder 62Table of Contentscrediting rates due to policyholder guarantees in the form of minimum crediting rates or otherwise due to market conditions. A significant majority of Athene’s deferred annuity products have crediting rates that it may reset annually upon renewal following the expiration of the current guaranteed period. While Athene has the contractual ability to lower these crediting rates to the guaranteed minimum levels, its willingness to do so may be limited by competitive pressures.See “Part II—Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” which includes a discussion regarding interest rate and other significant risks and Athene’s strategies for managing these risks.Overview of Results of OperationsFinancial Measures under U.S. GAAP - Asset ManagementThe following discussion of financial measures under U.S. GAAP is based on Apollo’s asset management business as of December 31, 2022.RevenuesManagement FeesThe significant growth of the assets we manage has had a positive effect on our revenues. Management fees are typically calculated based upon any of “net asset value,” “gross assets,” “adjusted par asset value,” “adjusted costs of all unrealized portfolio investments,” “capital commitments,” “invested capital,” “adjusted assets,” “capital contributions,” or “stockholders’ equity,” each as defined in the applicable limited partnership agreement and/or management agreement of the unconsolidated funds or accounts.Advisory and Transaction Fees, NetAs a result of providing advisory services with respect to actual and potential investments, we are entitled to receive fees for transactions related to the acquisition and, in certain instances, disposition and financing of companies, some of which are portfolio companies of the funds we manage, as well as fees for ongoing monitoring of portfolio company operations and directors’ fees. We also receive advisory fees for advisory services provided to certain funds. In addition, monitoring fees are generated on certain structured portfolio company investments. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreements for certain funds, the management fee payable by the funds may be subject to a reduction based on a certain percentage (up to 100%) of such advisory and transaction fees, net of applicable broken deal costs (“Management Fee Offset”). Such amounts are presented as a reduction to advisory and transaction fees, net, in the consolidated statements of operations (see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on advisory and transaction fees, net). Performance FeesThe general partners of the funds we manage are entitled to an incentive return of normally up to 20% of the total returns of a fund’s capital, depending upon performance of the underlying funds and subject to preferred returns and high water marks, as applicable. Performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, are accounted for as an equity method investment, and effectively, the performance fees for any period are based upon an assumed liquidation of the funds’ assets at the reporting date, and distribution of the net proceeds in accordance with the funds’ allocation provisions. Performance fees categorized as incentive fees, which are not accounted as an equity method investment, are deferred until fees are probable to not be significantly reversed. The majority of performance fees are comprised of performance allocations.As of December 31, 2022, approximately 45% of the value of the investments of the funds we manage, on a gross basis, was determined using market-based valuation methods (i.e., reliance on broker or listed exchange quotes) and the remaining 55% was determined primarily by comparable company and industry multiples or discounted cash flow models. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Asset Management Business—The performance of the funds we manage, and our performance, may be adversely affected by the financial performance of portfolio companies of the funds we manage and the industries in which the funds we manage invest” for discussion regarding certain industry-specific risks that could affect the fair value of certain of the portfolio company investments of the funds we manage.In certain funds we manage, generally in our equity strategy, the Company does not earn performance fees until the investors have achieved cumulative investment returns on invested capital (including management fees and expenses) in excess of an 8% 63Table of Contentshurdle rate. Additionally, certain of the yield and hybrid funds we manage have various performance fee rates and hurdle rates. Certain of the yield and hybrid funds we manage allocate performance fees to the general partner in a similar manner as the equity funds. In certain funds we manage, as long as the investors achieve their priority returns, there is a catch-up formula whereby the Company earns a priority return for a portion of the return until the Company’s performance fees equate to its incentive fee rate for that fund; thereafter, the Company participates in returns from the fund at the performance fee rate. Performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, are subject to reversal to the extent that the performance fees distributed exceed the amount due to the general partner based on a fund’s cumulative investment returns. The Company recognizes potential repayment of previously received performance fees as a general partner obligation representing all amounts previously distributed to the general partner that would need to be repaid to the Apollo funds if these funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds’ investments as of the reporting date. The actual general partner obligation, however, would not become payable or realized until the end of a fund’s life or as otherwise set forth in the respective limited partnership agreement of the fund.The table below presents an analysis of Apollo’s (i) performance fees receivable on an unconsolidated basis and (ii) realized and unrealized performance fees:As of December 31,Performance Fees for the Year Ended December 31, 2022Performance Fees for the Year Ended December 31, 2021Performance Fees for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 20222021(In millions)Performance Fees Receivable on an Unconsolidated BasisUnrealizedRealizedTotalUnrealizedRealizedTotalUnrealizedRealizedTotalAIOF I and II$10.7 $16.0 $(5.3)$26.8 $21.5 $3.2 $16.1 $19.3 $(5.4)$15.4 $10.0 ANRP I, II and III133.5 89.9 (66.0)2.7 (63.3)109.9 51.8 161.7 (21.4)0.3 (21.1)EPF Funds171.4 135.2 (79.0)47.5 (31.5)57.3 44.7 102.0 (148.8)35.0 (113.8)FCI Funds138.1 139.3 (1.2)— (1.2)66.6 — 66.6 (9.3)— (9.3)Fund IX1,261.8 768.2 493.6 200.3 693.9 614.4 389.1 1,003.5 153.8 — 153.8 Fund VIII369.2 726.2 (357.0)22.0 (335.0)(74.2)671.6 597.4 84.8 — 84.8 Fund VII239.8 77.3 (37.7)44.4 6.7 182.3 49.4 231.7 (7.4)0.5 (6.9)Fund VI17.7 16.3 (1.3)2.7 1.4 (1.6)— (1.6)— 0.7 0.7 Fund IV and Fund V1— — 0.3 — 0.3 (0.5)— (0.5)(0.6)— (0.6)HVF I43.8 106.1 (62.2)116.3 54.1 53.6 65.3 118.9 52.8 19.8 72.6 Real Estate Equity62.8 42.1 22.0 18.1 40.1 27.5 0.7 28.2 (28.2)12.4 (15.8)Corporate Credit19.4 18.3 3.6 19.4 23.0 4.4 15.8 20.2 1.4 8.8 10.2 Structured Finance and ABS85.5 98.8 (3.9)23.5 19.6 46.3 33.4 79.7 2.7 13.0 15.7 Direct Origination145.5 108.8 36.2 34.9 71.1 50.0 23.5 73.5 (10.2)11.0 0.8 Other1,3382.9 432.6 55.6 108.1 163.7 175.0 433.2 608.2 (27.0)173.9 146.9 Total$2,682.1 $2,775.1 $(2.3)$666.7 $664.4 $1,314.2 $1,794.6 $3,108.8 $37.2 $290.8 $328.0 Total, net of profit sharing payable4/expense$1,380.1 $1,431.0 $(17.4)$129.7 $112.3 $811.5 $807.8 $1,619.3 $1.4 $96.8 $98.2 1 As of December 31, 2022, certain funds had $106.5 million in general partner obligations to return previously distributed performance fees. The fair value gain on investments and income at the fund level needed to reverse the general partner obligations was $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. 2 As of December 31, 2022, the remaining investments and escrow cash of Fund VII was valued at 112% of the fund’s unreturned capital, which was below the required escrow ratio of 115%. As a result, the fund is required to place in escrow current and future performance fee distributions to the general partner until the specified return ratio of 115% is met (at the time of a future distribution) or upon liquidation. As of December 31, 2022, Fund VII had $85.5 million of gross performance fees or $48.7 million net of profit sharing, in escrow. With respect to Fund VII, realized performance fees currently distributed to the general partner are limited to potential tax distributions and interest on escrow balances per the fund’s partnership agreements. Performance fees receivable as of December 31, 2022 and realized performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2022 include interest earned on escrow balances that is not subject to contingent repayment. 3 Other includes certain SIAs. 4 There was a corresponding profit sharing payable of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, including profit sharing payable related to amounts in escrow and contingent consideration obligations of $55.0 million.The general partners of certain of the funds we manage accrue performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, when the fair value of investments exceeds the cost basis of the individual investors’ investments in the fund, including any allocable share of expenses incurred in connection with such investments, which we refer to as “high water marks.” These high water marks are applied on an individual investor basis. Certain of the funds we manage have investors with various high water marks, the achievement of which is subject to market conditions and investment performance.Performance fees from certain funds we manage are subject to contingent repayment by the general partner in the event of future losses to the extent that the cumulative performance fees distributed from inception to date exceeds the amount computed 64Table of Contentsas due to the general partner at the final distribution. These general partner obligations, if applicable, are included in due to related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition.The following table summarizes our performance fees since inception through December 31, 2022:Performance Fees Since Inception1 Undistributed by Fund and RecognizedDistributed by Fund and Recognized2Total Undistributed and Distributed by Fund and Recognized3General Partner Obligation3Maximum Performance Fees Subject to Potential Reversal4 (in millions)AIOF I and II$10.7 $58.4 $69.1 $— $38.3 ANRP I, II and III33.5 159.1 192.6 21.5 48.6 EPF Funds71.4 484.7 556.1 41.4 321.2 FCI Funds138.1 24.2 162.3 — 138.1 Fund IX1,261.8 589.5 1,851.3 — 1,640.6 Fund VIII369.2 1,660.8 2,030.0 — 1,425.0 Fund VII39.8 3,225.7 3,265.5 — 14.6 Fund VI17.7 1,663.9 1,681.6 — — Fund IV and Fund V— 2,053.1 2,053.1 31.4 — HVF I43.8 201.4 245.2 — 142.5 Real Estate Equity62.8 75.3 138.1 — 77.5 Corporate Credit19.4 926.2 945.6 — 10.0 Structured Finance and ABS85.5 52.2 137.7 — 61.7 Direct Origination145.5 73.3 218.8 — 134.2 Other5382.9 1,692.6 2,075.5 12.2 563.6 Total$2,682.1 $12,940.4 $15,622.5 $106.5 $4,615.9 1 Certain funds are denominated in euros and historical figures are translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of €1.00 to $1.07 as of December 31, 2022. Certain funds are denominated in pounds sterling and historical figures are translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of £1.00 to $1.21 as of December 31, 2022.2 Amounts in “Distributed by Fund and Recognized” for the Citi Property Investors (“CPI”), Gulf Stream Asset Management, LLC (“Gulf Stream”), Stone Tower Capital LLC and its related companies (“Stone Tower”) funds and SIAs are presented for activity subsequent to the respective acquisition dates. Amounts exclude certain performance fees from business development companies and Redding Ridge Holdings LP (“Redding Ridge Holdings”), an affiliate of Redding Ridge.3 Amounts were computed based on the fair value of fund investments on December 31, 2022. Performance fees have been allocated to and recognized by the general partner. Based on the amount allocated, a portion is subject to potential reversal or, to the extent applicable, has been reduced by the general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees at December 31, 2022. The actual determination and any required payment of any such general partner obligation would not take place until the final disposition of the fund’s investments based on contractual termination of the fund.4 Represents the amount of performance fees that would be reversed if remaining fund investments became worthless on December 31, 2022. Amounts subject to potential reversal of performance fees include amounts undistributed by a fund (i.e., the performance fees receivable), as well as a portion of the amounts that have been distributed by a fund, net of taxes and not subject to a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees, except for those funds that are gross of taxes as defined in the respective funds’ governing documents.5 Other includes certain SIAs.ExpensesCompensation and BenefitsThe most significant expense in our asset management business is compensation and benefits expense. This consists of fixed salary, discretionary and non-discretionary bonuses, profit sharing expense associated with the performance fees earned and compensation expense associated with the vesting of non-cash equity-based awards.Our compensation arrangements with certain employees contain a significant performance-based incentive component. Therefore, as our net revenues increase, our compensation costs rise. Our compensation costs also reflect the increased investment in people as we expand geographically and create new funds.In addition, certain professionals and selected other individuals have a profit sharing interest in the performance fees earned in order to better align their interests with our own and with those of the investors in the funds we manage. Profit sharing expense is part of our compensation and benefits expense and is generally based upon a fixed percentage of performance fees. Certain of 65Table of Contentsour performance-based incentive arrangements provide for compensation based on realized performance fees which includes fees earned by the general partners of the funds we manage under the applicable fund limited partnership agreements based upon transactions that have closed or other rights to incentive income cash that have become fixed in the applicable calendar year period. Profit sharing expense can reverse during periods when there is a decline in performance fees that were previously recognized. Profit sharing amounts are normally distributed to employees after the corresponding investment gains have been realized and generally before preferred returns are achieved for the investors. Therefore, changes in our unrealized performance fees have the same effect on our profit sharing expense. Profit sharing expense increases when unrealized performance fees increase. Realizations only impact profit sharing expense to the extent that the effects on investments have not been recognized previously. If losses on other investments within a fund are subsequently realized, the profit sharing amounts previously distributed are normally subject to a general partner obligation to return performance fees previously distributed back to the funds. This general partner obligation due to the funds would be realized only when the fund is liquidated, which generally occurs at the end of the fund’s term. However, indemnification obligations also exist for realized gains with respect to Fund IV, Fund V and Fund VI, which, although our Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners would remain personally liable, may indemnify our Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners for 17.5% to 100% of the previously distributed profits regardless of the fund’s future performance. See note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s indemnification liability.The Company grants equity awards to certain employees, including RSUs and restricted shares of common stock, that generally vest and become exercisable in quarterly installments or annual installments depending on the award terms. In some instances, vesting of an RSU is also subject to the Company’s receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods, sufficient to cover the associated equity-based compensation expense. See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of equity-based compensation.Other expensesThe balance of our other expenses includes interest, placement fees, and general, administrative and other operating expenses. Interest expense consists primarily of interest related to the 2024 Senior Notes, the 2026 Senior Notes, the 2029 Senior Notes, the 2030 Senior Notes, the 2048 Senior Notes and the 2050 Subordinated Notes as discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Placement fees are incurred in connection with our capital raising activities. In cases where the limited partners of the funds are determined to be the customer in an arrangement, placement fees may be capitalized as a cost to acquire a customer contract, and amortized over the life of the customer contract. General, administrative and other expenses includes occupancy expense, depreciation and amortization, professional fees and costs related to travel, information technology and administration. Occupancy expense represents charges related to office leases and associated expenses, such as utilities and maintenance fees. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets is normally calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to sixteen years, taking into consideration any residual value. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the expected term of the lease. Intangible assets are amortized based on the future cash flows over the expected useful lives of the assets.Other Income (Loss)Net Gains (Losses) from Investment ActivitiesNet gains (losses) from investment activities include both realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses in our investment portfolio between the opening reporting date and the closing reporting date. Net unrealized gains (losses) are a result of changes in the fair value of unrealized investments and reversal of unrealized gains (losses) due to dispositions of investments during the reporting period. Significant judgment and estimation goes into the assumptions that drive these models and the actual values realized with respect to investments could be materially different from values obtained based on the use of those models. The valuation methodologies applied impact the reported value of investment company holdings and their underlying portfolios in our consolidated financial statements.Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”)Changes in the fair value of the consolidated VIEs’ assets and liabilities and related interest, dividend and other income and expenses subsequent to consolidation are presented within net gains (losses) from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities and are attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated statements of operations.66Table of ContentsOther Income (Losses), NetOther income (losses), net includes gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement liability and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses.Financial Measures under U.S. GAAP - Retirement ServicesThe following discussion of financial measures under U.S. GAAP is based on the Company’s retirement services business which is operated by Athene as of December 31, 2022.RevenuesPremiumsPremiums for long-duration contracts, including products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. Insurance revenues are reported net of amounts ceded.Product chargesRevenues for universal life-type policies and investment contracts, including surrender and market value adjustments, costs of insurance, policy administration, GMDB, GLWB and no-lapse guarantee charges, are earned when assessed against policyholder account balances during the period.Net investment incomeNet investment income is a significant component of Athene’s total revenues. Athene recognizes investment income as it accrues or is legally due, net of investment management and custody fees. Investment income on fixed maturity securities includes coupon interest, as well as the amortization of any premium and the accretion of any discount. Investment income on equity securities represents dividend income and preferred coupon interest.Investment related gains (losses)Investment related gains (losses) primarily consist of (i) realized gains and losses on sales of investments, (ii) unrealized gains or losses relating to identified risks within AFS securities in fair value hedging relationships, (iii) gains and losses on trading securities, (iv) gains and losses on equity securities, (v) change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and derivatives not designated as a hedge, (vi) change in fair value of mortgage loan assets and (vii) allowance for expected credit losses recorded through the provision for credit losses.ExpensesInterest sensitive contract benefitsUniversal life-type policies and investment contracts include fixed indexed and traditional fixed annuities in the accumulation phase, funding agreements, universal life insurance, fixed indexed universal life insurance and immediate annuities without significant mortality risk (which includes pension group annuities without life contingencies). Liabilities for traditional fixed annuities, universal life insurance and funding agreements are carried at the account balances without reduction for potential surrender or withdrawal charges, except for a block of universal life business ceded to Global Atlantic which is carried at fair value. Fixed indexed annuities and fixed indexed universal life insurance contracts contain an embedded derivative. Benefits reserves for fixed indexed annuities and fixed indexed universal life insurance contracts are reported as the sum of the fair value of the embedded derivative and the host (or guaranteed) component of the contracts. Liabilities for immediate annuities without significant mortality risk are calculated as the present value of future liability cash flows and policy maintenance expenses discounted at contractual interest rates.Changes in the interest sensitive contract liabilities, excluding deposits and withdrawals, are recorded in interest sensitive contract benefits or product charges on the consolidated statements of operations. 67Table of ContentsFuture policy and other policy benefitsAthene issues contracts classified as long-duration, which includes term and whole life, accident and health, disability, and deferred and immediate annuities with life contingencies (which includes pension group annuities with life contingencies). Liabilities for non-participating long-duration contracts are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods which require the use of assumptions related to expenses, investment yields, mortality, morbidity and persistency at the date of issue or acquisition.Changes in future policy benefits other than the adjustment for the OCI effects of unrealized investment gains and losses on AFS securities, are recorded in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations.Amortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements, and value of business acquiredCosts related directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance or investment contracts are deferred to the extent they are recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. These costs consist of commissions and policy issuance costs, as well as sales inducements credited to policyholder account balances.Deferred costs related to investment contracts without significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are amortized using the effective interest method. Deferred costs related to universal life-type policies and investment contracts with significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are amortized over the lives of the policies, based upon the proportion of the present value of actual and expected deferred costs to the present value of actual and expected gross profits to be earned over the life of the policies. VOBA associated with acquired contracts is amortized in relation to applicable policyholder liabilities.Policy and other operating expensesPolicy and other operating expenses includes normal operating expenses, policy acquisition expenses, interest expense, dividends to policyholders, integration, restructuring and other non-operating expenses, and stock compensation expenses.Other Financial Measures under U.S. GAAP Income TaxesSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating income tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We recognize the income tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the positions. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. The Company’s income tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether or not we have uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition or de-recognition.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences, using currently enacted tax rates, of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.Non-Controlling InterestsFor entities that are consolidated, but not 100% owned, a portion of the income or loss and corresponding equity is allocated to owners other than Apollo. The aggregate of the income or loss and corresponding equity that is not owned by the Company is included in non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. Non-controlling interests primarily include limited partner interests in certain consolidated funds and VIEs. Prior to the Mergers on January 1, 2022, the non-controlling interests relating to Apollo Global Management, Inc. also included the ownership interest in the Apollo Operating Group held by the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners through their limited partner interests in AP Professional Holdings, L.P. and the non-controlling interest in the Apollo Operating Group held by Athene. 68Table of ContentsThe authoritative guidance for non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements requires reporting entities to present non-controlling interest as equity and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and non-controlling interests. According to the guidance, (1) non-controlling interests are presented as a separate component of stockholders’ equity on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition, (2) net income (loss) includes the net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest holders on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, (3) the primary components of non-controlling interest are separately presented in the Company’s consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity to clearly distinguish the interests in the Apollo Operating Group and other ownership interests in the consolidated entities and (4) profits and losses are allocated to non-controlling interests in proportion to their ownership interests regardless of their basis.Results of OperationsBelow is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Investment income (loss) decreased $2.9 billion in 2022 to $796 million compared to $3.7 billion in 2021. The decrease in investment income (loss) of $2.9 billion in 2022 was primarily driven by decreases in performance allocations.Significant drivers for performance allocations in 2021 were performance allocations earned from Fund IX, Fund VIII and Fund VII of $1.2 billion, $650 million and $232 million, respectively, primarily as a result of fund appreciation and realization activity. Significant drivers for performance allocations in 2022 were performance allocations primarily earned from Fund IX of $711 million, partially offset by performance allocation losses from Fund VIII of $349 million, as a result of continued equity market volatility in 2022.See below for details on the respective funds’ performance allocations in 2022.The performance allocations earned from Fund IX in 2022 were primarily driven by appreciation and realization of the fund’s investments in the consumer services, leisure and media, telecom and technology sectors.The performance allocation losses from Fund VIII in 2022 were primarily driven by depreciation in the value of the fund’s investments in the consumer services, leisure and media, telecom and technology sectors.Management fees decreased by $418 million to $1.5 billion in 2022 from $1.9 billion in 2021. The decrease for 2022 was primarily driven by the elimination of management fees between AAM and Athene subsidiaries upon consolidation, as a result of the Mergers. The decrease was partially offset by increases in management fees earned from Apollo Diversified Real Estate 70Table of ContentsFund and Apollo Diversified Credit Fund (collectively “ADREF and ADCF”) of $66 million, as a result of the management fee contribution from the Griffin Capital U.S. asset management business acquisition, and from MidCap of $35 million, driven by higher Fee-Generating AUM.The decreases in investment income (loss) and management fees were offset, in part, by an increase in advisory and transaction fees. Advisory and transaction fees increased by $141 million to $443 million in 2022 from $302 million in 2021. Advisory and transaction fees earned during 2022 were primarily attributable to advisory and transaction fees earned from companies in the consumer services, financial services, healthcare, energy, leisure, manufacturing and consumer and retail sectors, as well as structuring fees earned from companies in the financial services, entertainment and real estate sectors.ExpensesExpenses were $2.7 billion in 2022, a decrease of $1.4 billion from $4.1 billion in 2021 due to a decrease in profit sharing expense of $1.0 billion resulting from the corresponding lower investment income (loss) during 2022. In any period, the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance allocations in the period. Additionally, there was a decrease in equity-based compensation of $697 million as there were one-time equity-based awards granted in connection with the Company’s compensation reset in 2021. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in salary, bonus and benefits of $149 million due to accelerated headcount growth in 2022, including for certain senior level roles, as the Company strategically invests in talent that will seek to capture its next phase of growth. Equity-based compensation expense in 2022 is comprised of: i) performance grants which are tied to the Company’s receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods and are typically recognized on an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period to the extent the performance revenue metrics are met or deemed probable, and ii) the impact of the 2021 one-time grants awarded to the Co-Presidents, which vest on a cliff basis subject to continued employment over five years and the Company’s achievement of FRE and SRE per share metrics. General, administrative and other expenses were $682 million in 2022, an increase of $200 million from $482 million in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily driven by increases in the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the Company’s commitment asset and other depreciable assets, higher travel and entertainment expenses and the absorption of occupancy expense to support the Company’s increased headcount, including from the acquisition of Griffin Capital’s U.S. asset management business.Other Income (Loss)Other income (loss) was $697 million in 2022, a decrease of $2.3 billion from $3.0 billion in 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in net gains (losses) from investment activities, as a result of AAM no longer holding an interest in Athene Holding following the Mergers. Other income (loss) in 2022 was primarily attributable to net gains from investment activities of consolidated VIEs and income earned as a result of APSG I’s deconsolidation event. Other income (loss) in 2021 was primarily due to net gains from investment activities from the Company’s investment in Athene Holding during 2021. Retirement ServicesRevenuesRetirement Services revenues were $8.2 billion in 2022. Revenues were primarily driven by pension group annuity premiums, net investment income and product charges, partially offset by the adverse impact from investment related losses. Investment related losses of $12.7 billion were primarily driven by unfavorable changes in the fair value of reinsurance assets, FIA hedging derivatives, mortgage loans, trading and equity securities, realized losses on AFS securities and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by foreign exchange derivative gains. The losses on Retirement Services’ assets were primarily due to an increase in U.S. Treasury rates and credit spread widening in 2022. The change in fair value of FIA hedging derivatives decreased due to the unfavorable performance of the indices upon which Athene’s call options are based as the largest percentage of call options are based on the S&P 500 index, which decreased 19.4% in 2022. The unfavorable change in the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by unfavorable economics. The foreign exchange derivative gains were primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2022 for assets denominated in foreign currencies.71Table of ContentsExpensesRetirement Services expenses were $14.7 billion in 2022. Expenses were primarily driven by pension group annuity and payout annuity obligations, policy and other operating expenses, interest credited to policyholders, interest paid on funding agreements and the amortization of DAC and VOBA, partially offset by a decrease in the change in FIA fair value embedded derivatives and negative VOBA amortization. The change in FIA fair value embedded derivatives was primarily due to the performance of the equity indices to which Athene’s FIA policies are linked, primarily the S&P 500 index, which decreased 19.4% in 2022, as well as the favorable change in discount rates and favorable unlocking, partially offset by unfavorable economics impacting policyholder projected benefits. The FIA fair value embedded derivatives unlocking in 2022 was $41 million favorable due to changes to projected interest crediting, partially offset by the impact of higher rates on future account values.Income Tax (Provision) BenefitThe Company’s income tax (provision) benefit totaled $1.1 billion and $(594) million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change to the provision was primarily related to the decrease in pre-tax income and a tax benefit from the derecognition of a deferred tax liability related to the Mergers. The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign income taxes resulting in an effective income tax rate of 18.4% and 12.2% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The most significant reconciling items between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the effective income tax rate were due to the following: (i) a benefit realized from the derecognition of a deferred tax liability related to the Company’s historical holdings in Athene, (ii) foreign, state and local income taxes, including NYC UBT, (iii) income attributable to non-controlling interests and (iv) equity-based compensation net of the limiting provisions for executive compensation under IRC Section 162(m) (see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the Company’s income tax provision). Managing Business Performance - Key Segment and Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures We believe that the presentation of Adjusted Segment Income supplements a reader’s understanding of the economic operating performance of each of our segments.Adjusted Segment Income and Adjusted Net IncomeAdjusted Segment Income, or “ASI”, is the key performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of the Asset Management, Retirement Services, and Principal Investing segments. See note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of ASI and management’s consideration of ASI.We believe that ASI is helpful for an understanding of our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance. This measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed below in “—Overview of Results of Operations” that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted Net Income (“ANI”) represents Adjusted Segment Income less HoldCo interest and other financing costs and estimated income taxes. For purposes of calculating the Adjusted Net Income tax rate, Adjusted Segment Income is reduced by HoldCo interest and financing costs. Income taxes on FRE and PII represents the total current corporate, local, and non-U.S. taxes as well as the current payable under Apollo’s tax receivable agreement. Income taxes on FRE and PII excludes the impacts of deferred taxes and the remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement, which arise from changes in estimated future tax rates. Certain assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied FRE and PII income tax provision are similar to those used under U.S. GAAP. Specifically, certain deductions considered in the income tax provision under U.S. GAAP relating to transaction related charges, equity-based compensation, and tax deductible interest expense are taken into account for the implied tax provision. Income Taxes on SRE represent the total current and deferred tax expense or benefit on income before taxes adjusted to eliminate the impact of the tax expense or benefit associated with the non-operating adjustments. Management believes the methodologies used to compute income taxes on FRE, SRE, and PII are meaningful to each segment and increases comparability of income taxes between periods.Fee Related Earnings, Spread Related Earnings and Principal Investing IncomeFee Related Earnings, or “FRE”, is a component of ASI that is used as a supplemental performance measure to assess the performance of the Asset Management segment.72Table of ContentsSpread Related Earnings, or “SRE”, is a component of ASI that is used as a supplemental performance measure to assess the performance of the Retirement Services segment, excluding certain market volatility and certain expenses related to integration, restructuring, equity-based compensation, and other expenses.Principal Investing Income, or “PII”, is a component of ASI that is used as a supplemental performance measure to assess the performance of the Principal Investing segment. See note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of FRE, SRE, and PII.We use ASI, ANI, FRE, SRE and PII as measures of operating performance, not as measures of liquidity. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The use of these measures without consideration of their related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described above.Net Invested AssetsIn managing its business, Athene analyzes net invested assets, which does not correspond to total Athene investments, including investments in related parties, as disclosed in the consolidated statements of financial condition and notes thereto. Net invested assets represent the investments that directly back its net reserve liabilities as well as surplus assets. Net invested assets is used in the computation of net investment earned rate, which is used to analyze the profitability of Athene’s investment portfolio. Net invested assets includes (a) total investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition with AFS securities at cost or amortized cost, excluding derivatives, (b) cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, (c) investments in related parties, (d) accrued investment income, (e) VIE and VOE assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest adjustments, (f) net investment payables and receivables, (g) policy loans ceded (which offset the direct policy loans in total investments) and (h) an adjustment for the allowance for credit losses. Net invested assets also excludes assets associated with funds withheld liabilities related to business exited through reinsurance agreements and derivative collateral (offsetting the related cash positions). Athene includes the underlying investments supporting its assumed funds withheld and modco agreements in its net invested assets calculation in order to match the assets with the income received. Athene believes the adjustments for reinsurance provide a view of the assets for which it has economic exposure. Net invested assets includes Athene’s proportionate share of ACRA investments, based on its economic ownership, but does not include the proportionate share of investments associated with the non-controlling interest. Net invested assets are averaged over the number of quarters in the relevant period to compute a net investment earned rate for such period. While Athene believes net invested assets is a meaningful financial metric and enhances the understanding of the underlying drivers of its investment portfolio, it should not be used as a substitute for Athene’s total investments, including related parties, presented under U.S. GAAP. 73Table of ContentsSegment Analysis Discussed below are our results of operations for each of our reportable segments.

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021FRE was $1.4 billion in 2022, an increase of $143 million compared to $1.3 billion in 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to the continued growth in management fees, and record capital solutions fees and other, net. The increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from Athene of $172 million and ADREF and ADCF of $66 million, as a result of higher fee-generating AUM and the management fee contribution from the Griffin Capital U.S. asset management business acquisition, respectively. Capital solutions fees earned in 2022 were primarily attributable to fees earned from companies in the consumer services, financial services, healthcare, energy, leisure, manufacturing, consumer and retail, business services, entertainment and real estate sectors. The growth in revenues was offset, in part, by increases in fee-related compensation expense associated with the re-basing of cost structure to support the Company’s next phase of growth, as well as costs associated with Griffin Capital’s U.S. asset management business.Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020FRE was $1.3 billion in 2021, an increase of $165 million compared to $1.1 billion in 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to the growth in management fees of $230 million in 2022. The increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from Athene and Athora of $160 million and $49 million, respectively. The growth in revenues was offset, in part, by higher fee-related compensation expense due to an increase in headcount and increases in depreciation and amortization expenses, occupancy costs and recruiting fees, as we continued to expand our global team in 2021.Asset Management Operating MetricsWe monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the alternative asset management industry and directly impact the performance of our Asset Management segment.

The Company, through ISG, also provides sub-allocation services with respect to a portion of the assets in the Athene Accounts. Apollo, through its asset management business, managed or advised $236.0 billion and $212.6 billion of AUM on behalf of Athene as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Apollo, through ISGI, provides investment advisory services with respect to certain assets in certain portfolio companies of Apollo funds and sub-advises the Athora Accounts and broadly refers to “Athora Sub-Advised” assets as those assets in the Athora Accounts which the Company explicitly sub-advises as well as those assets in the Athora Accounts which are invested 76Table of Contentsdirectly in funds and investment vehicles Apollo manages.

The net increase was primarily due to growth of our retirement services assets, subscriptions across the platform, increased leverage, and the acquisition of Griffin Capital’s U.S. asset management business; partially offset by distributions driven by a one-time release of unfunded commitments, and market activity across our yield strategy due to foreign exchange depreciation and market related changes.

The net increase was primarily due to growth of our retirement services assets, deployment and fee commencement, fundraising, and the acquisition of Griffin Capital’s U.S. asset management business. This increase was partially offset by market activity across our yield strategy due to foreign exchange depreciation, market related changes and realizations.

Gross Capital Deployment is not reduced or netted down by sales or refinancings, and takes into account leverage used by the funds and accounts we manage in gaining exposure to the various investments that they have made.Uncalled commitments, by contrast, represent unfunded capital commitments that certain of Apollo’s funds have received from fund investors to fund future or current fund investments and expenses.Gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments are indicative of the pace and magnitude of fund capital that is deployed or will be deployed, and which therefore could result in future revenues that include management fees, transaction fees and performance fees to the extent they are fee-generating. Gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments can also give rise to future costs that are related to the hiring of additional resources to manage and account for the additional capital that is deployed or will be deployed. Management uses gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments as key operating metrics since we believe the results are measures of investment activities of the funds we manage.The following presents gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments (in billions): As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Apollo had $51 billion and $47 billion of dry powder, respectively, which represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment subject to the provisions of the applicable limited partnership agreements or other governing agreements of the funds, partnerships and accounts we manage. These amounts exclude uncalled commitments which can only be called for fund fees and expenses and commitments from perpetual capital vehicles.79Table of ContentsRetirement ServicesThe following table presents Spread Related Earnings, the performance measure of our Retirement Services segment.

SRE for the year ended December 31, 2022 was mainly attributed to fixed income and other investment income and strong alternative investment income, partially offset by cost of funds, other operating expenses and interest and other financing costs. Fixed income and other investment income benefited from strong growth in organic inflows as well as floating rate income driven by the increase in rates. As a result of purchase accounting, the book value of Athene’s investment portfolio was marked up to fair value resulting in an adverse impact to fixed income and other investment income. Alternative investment income benefited from the deployment of inflows into alternative investments as well as strong performance on real estate funds, yield funds, Athora and MidCap, partially offset by unfavorable economics. Cost of funds was primarily driven by interest credited and option costs on annuity products, pension group annuity and payout annuity obligations, interest on funding agreement issuances, income rider reserve and DAC and VOBA amortization as well as other liability costs. As a result of purchase accounting, Athene marked its reserve liabilities to fair value resulting in a favorable impact to cost of funds. Additionally, cost of funds was favorably impacted by actuarial experience and unlocking. Unlocking, net of noncontrolling interests, was favorable $6 million primarily related to the impact of higher rates on future account values, partially offset by changes to projected interest crediting.

The fixed income earned rate was adversely impacted by unfavorable purchase accounting impacts, partially offset by floating rate income due to the increase in rates. The alternative investment earned rate was driven by strong performance on real estate funds, yield funds, Athora and MidCap, partially offset by unfavorable economics.Strategic capital management fees of 0.03% for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of the management fees received by Athene for business managed for others, primarily the non-controlling interest portion of Athene’s business ceded to ACRA. 80Table of ContentsCost of funds of 2.06% for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by interest credited and option costs on annuity products, pension group annuity and payout annuity obligations, interest on funding agreement issuances, income rider reserve and DAC and VOBA amortization as well as other liability costs. As a result of purchase accounting, Athene marked its reserve liabilities to fair value resulting in a favorable impact to cost of funds. Additionally, cost of funds was favorably impacted by actuarial experience and unlocking.Investment PortfolioAthene had investments, including related parties and VIEs, of $212.1 billion as of December 31, 2022. Athene’s investment strategy seeks to achieve sustainable risk-adjusted returns through the disciplined management of its investment portfolio against its long-duration liabilities, coupled with the diversification of risk. The investment strategies focus primarily on a buy and hold asset allocation strategy that may be adjusted periodically in response to changing market conditions and the nature of Athene’s liability profile. Athene takes advantage of its generally persistent liability profile by identifying investment opportunities with an emphasis on earning incremental yield by taking liquidity and complexity risk rather than assuming incremental credit risk. Athene has selected a diverse array of primarily high-grade fixed income assets, including corporate bonds, structured securities and commercial and residential real estate loans, among others. Athene also maintains holdings in floating rate and less rate-sensitive instruments, including CLOs, non-agency RMBS and various types of structured products. In addition to its fixed income portfolio, Athene opportunistically allocates approximately 5% to 6% of its portfolio to alternative investments where it primarily focuses on fixed income-like, cash flow-based investments.The following table presents the carrying values of Athene’s total investments, including related parties and VIEs:December 31, 2022(In millions, except percentages)Carrying ValuePercent of TotalAFS securitiesU.S. government and agencies$2,577 1.2 %U.S. state, municipal and political subdivisions927 0.4 %Foreign governments907 0.4 %Corporate60,901 28.7 %CLO16,493 7.8 %ABS10,527 5.0 %CMBS4,158 2.0 %RMBS5,914 2.8 %Total AFS securities, at fair value102,404 48.3 %Trading securities, at fair value1,595 0.8 %Equity securities1,487 0.7 %Mortgage loans, at fair value27,454 12.9 %Investment funds79 — %Policy loans347 0.2 %Funds withheld at interest32,880 15.5 %Derivative assets3,309 1.6 %Short-term investments2,160 1.0 %Other investments773 0.4 %Total investments172,488 81.4 %Investments in related partiesAFS securitiesCorporate982 0.5 %CLO3,079 1.4 %ABS5,760 2.7 %Total AFS securities, at fair value9,821 4.6 %Trading securities, at fair value878 0.4 %Equity securities, at fair value279 0.1 %Mortgage loans, at fair value1,302 0.6 %Investment funds1,569 0.7 %Funds withheld at interest9,808 4.6 %Other investments303 0.2 %Total related party investments23,960 11.2 %81Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2022(In millions, except percentages)Carrying ValuePercent of TotalTotal investments, including related parties196,448 92.6 %Investments owned by consolidated VIEsTrading securities, at fair value1,063 0.5 %Mortgage loans, at fair value2,055 1.0 %Investment funds, at fair value12,480 5.9 %Other investments, at fair value101 — %Total investments owned by consolidated VIEs15,699 7.4 %Total investments, including related parties and VIEs$212,147 100.0 %Athene’s investment portfolio consists largely of high quality fixed maturity securities, loans and short-term investments, as well as additional opportunistic holdings in investment funds and other instruments, including equity holdings. Fixed maturity securities and loans include publicly issued corporate bonds, government and other sovereign bonds, privately placed corporate bonds and loans, mortgage loans, CMBS, RMBS, CLOs and ABS. A significant majority of Athene’s AFS portfolio, 95.8% as of December 31, 2022, was invested in assets considered investment grade with a NAIC designation of 1 or 2.Athene invests a portion of its investment portfolio in mortgage loans, which are generally comprised of high quality commercial first lien and mezzanine real estate loans. Athene has acquired mortgage loans through acquisitions and reinsurance arrangements, as well as through an active program to invest in new mortgage loans. It invests in CMLs on income producing properties, including hotels, apartments, retail and office buildings, and other commercial and industrial properties. Athene’s RML portfolio primarily consists of first lien RMLs collateralized by properties located in the U.S. Funds withheld at interest represent a receivable for amounts contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with modco and funds withheld reinsurance agreements in which Athene acts as the reinsurer. Generally, assets equal to statutory reserves are withheld and legally owned by the ceding company.While the substantial majority of Athene’s investment portfolio has been allocated to corporate bonds and structured credit products, a key component of Athene’s investment strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of investment funds with attractive risk and return profiles. Athene’s investment fund portfolio consists of funds that employ various strategies, including equity, hybrid and yield funds. Athene has a strong preference for assets that have some or all of the following characteristics, among others: (1) investments that constitute a direct investment or an investment in a fund with a high degree of co-investment; (2) investments with credit- or debt-like characteristics (for example, a stipulated maturity and par value), or alternatively, investments with reduced volatility when compared to pure equity; or (3) investments that Athene believes have less downside risk.Athene holds derivatives for economic hedging purposes to reduce its exposure to the cash flow variability of assets and liabilities, equity market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk. Athene’s primary use of derivative instruments relates to providing the income needed to fund the annual indexed credits on its FIA products. Athene primarily uses fixed indexed options to economically hedge indexed annuity products that guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on a percentage of the gain in a specific market index.82Table of ContentsNet Invested AssetsThe following summarizes Athene’s net invested assets:December 31, 2022(In millions, except percentages)Net Invested Asset Value1Percent of TotalCorporate$80,800 41.1 %CLO19,881 10.1 %Credit100,681 51.2 %CML23,750 12.1 %RML11,147 5.7 %RMBS7,363 3.7 %CMBS4,495 2.3 %Real estate46,755 23.8 %ABS20,680 10.5 %Alternative investments12,079 6.1 %State, municipal, political subdivisions and foreign government2,715 1.4 %Equity securities1,737 0.9 %Short-term investments1,930 1.0 %U.S. government and agencies2,691 1.4 %Other investments41,832 21.3 %Cash and equivalents5,481 2.8 %Policy loans and other1,702 0.9 %Net invested assets196,451 100.0 %1 See Managing Business Performance - Key Segment and Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures for the definition of net invested assets.Athene’s net invested assets were $196.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. In managing its business, Athene utilizes net invested assets as presented in the above table. Net invested assets do not correspond to Athene’s total investments, including related parties, on the consolidated statements of financial condition, as discussed previously in Managing Business Performance - Key Segment and Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures. Net invested assets represent Athene’s investments that directly back the net reserve liabilities and surplus assets. Athene believes this view of its portfolio provides a view of the assets for which it has economic exposure. Athene adjusts the presentation for funds withheld and modco transactions to include or exclude the underlying investments based upon the contractual transfer of economic exposure to such underlying investments. Athene also adjusts for VIEs to show the net investment in the funds, which are included in the alternative investments line above, as well as adjusting for the allowance for credit losses. Net invested assets includes its proportionate share of ACRA investments, based on its economic ownership, but excludes the proportionate share of investments associated with the non-controlling interest.Net invested assets is utilized by management to evaluate Athene’s investment portfolio. Net invested assets is used in the computation of net investment earned rate, which allows Athene to analyze the profitability of its investment portfolio. Net invested assets is also used in Athene’s risk management processes for asset purchases, product design and underwriting, stress scenarios, liquidity, and ALM.83Table of ContentsPrincipal InvestingThe following table presents Principal Investing Income, the performance measure of our Principal Investing segment.Years ended December 31,Total ChangePercentage ChangeYears ended December 31,Total ChangePercentage Change 2022202120212020 (In millions)(In millions)Principal Investing:Realized performance fees$595.3 $1,589.1 $(993.8)(62.5)%$1,589.1 $280.9 $1,308.2 465.7%Realized investment income330.1 437.3 (107.2)(24.5)437.3 29.3 408.0 NMPrincipal investing compensation(585.1)(876.4)291.3 (33.2)(876.4)(222.4)(654.0)(294.1)Other operating expenses(55.8)(42.4)(13.4)31.6(42.4)(52.6)10.2 19.4Principal Investing Income (PII)$284.5 $1,107.6 $(823.1)(74.3)%$1,107.6 $35.2 $1,072.4 NMAs described in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—General”, earnings from our Principal Investing segment are inherently more volatile in nature than earnings from our Asset Management segment due to the intrinsic cyclical nature of performance fees, one of the key drivers of PII performance. In this section, references to 2022 refer to the year ended December 31, 2022, references to 2021 refer to the year ended December 31, 2021, and references to 2020 refer to the year ended December 31, 2020.Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021PII was $285 million in 2022, a decrease of $823 million, as compared to $1.1 billion in 2021. This decrease was primarily attributable to reduced realized performance fees as market volatility delayed monetization activity in 2022, offset, in part, by a corresponding decrease in principal investing compensation. In any period, the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance allocations in the period. Additionally, included in principal investing compensation are expenses related to the Incentive Pool, a compensation program through which certain employees are allocated discretionary compensation based on realized performance fees in a given year. The Incentive Pool is separate from the fund related profit sharing expense and may result in greater variability in compensation and have a variable impact on the blended profit sharing percentage during a particular period.Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020PII was $1.1 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.1 billion, as compared to $35 million in 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in realized performance fees and realized investment income, partially offset by an increase in principal investing compensation. Realized performance fees increased to $1.6 billion in 2021 from $281 million in 2020 driven by an increase in performance fees generated from Fund VIII and Fund IX of $700 million and $401 million, respectively. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in response caused severe disruption to the global economy and financial markets. In line with public equity and credit indices, the Company experienced significant unrealized mark-to-market losses in underlying funds which significantly delayed monetization activity. The increase in realized investment income in 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in realizations from the sale of a platform investment to certain funds we manage and Athora and an increase in realizations from Apollo’s equity ownership in Fund VIII. Principal investing compensation increased as a result of a corresponding increase in realized performance fees as described above.The Historical Investment Performance of Our FundsBelow we present information relating to the historical performance of the funds we manage, including certain legacy Apollo funds that do not have a meaningful amount of unrealized investments, and in respect of which the general partner interest has not been contributed to us.When considering the data presented below, you should note that the historical results of funds we manage are not indicative of the future results that you should expect from such funds, from any future funds we may raise or from your investment in our common shares.An investment in our common stock is not an investment in any of the Apollo funds, and the assets and revenues of our funds are not directly available to us. The historical and potential future returns of the funds we manage are not directly linked to 84Table of Contentsreturns on our common stock. Therefore, you should not conclude that continued positive performance of the funds we manage will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our common stock. However, poor performance of the funds that we manage would cause a decline in our revenue from such funds, and would therefore have a negative effect on our performance and in all likelihood the value of our common stock.Moreover, the historical returns of funds we manage should not be considered indicative of the future results you should expect from such funds or from any future funds we may raise. There can be no assurance that any Apollo fund will continue to achieve the same results in the future.Finally, our private equity IRRs have historically varied greatly from fund to fund. For example, Fund VI generated a 12% gross IRR and a 9% net IRR since its inception through December 31, 2022, while Fund V generated a 61% gross IRR and a 44% net IRR since its inception through December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the IRR going forward for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical IRR generated by any particular fund, or for our private equity funds as a whole.

Based on management’s experience, we believe that the Company’s current liquidity position, together with the cash generated from revenues will be sufficient to meet the Company’s anticipated expenses and other working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. For the longer-term liquidity needs of the asset management business, we expect to continue to fund the asset management business’ operations through management fees and performance fees received. The principal sources of liquidity for the retirement services business, in the ordinary course of business, are operating cash flows and holdings of cash, cash equivalents and other readily marketable assets.AGM is a holding company whose primary source of cash flow is distributions from its subsidiaries, which are expected to be sufficient to fund cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations. AGM’s primary liquidity needs include the cash-flow requirements relating to its corporate activities, including its day-to-day operations, common stock dividend payments and strategic transactions, such as acquisitions.At December 31, 2022, the Company had $9.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $0.7 billion of U.S. Treasury securities as well as $4.8 billion of available funds from the 2022 AMH credit facility, AHL credit facility, and AHL liquidity facility. 89Table of ContentsPrimary Uses of Cash Over the next 12 months, we expect the Company’s primary liquidity needs will be to:•support the future growth of Apollo’s businesses through strategic corporate investments;•pay the Company’s operating expenses, including, compensation, general, administrative, and other expense;•make payments to policyholders for surrenders, withdrawals and payout benefits;•make interest and principal payments on funding agreements;•make payments to satisfy pension group annuity obligations and policy acquisition costs;•pay taxes and tax related payments; •pay cash dividends;•make payments related to the AOG Unit Payment;•repurchase common stock; and•make payments under the tax receivable agreement.Over the long term, we believe we will be able to (i) grow Apollo’s Assets Under Management and generate positive investment performance in the funds we manage, which we expect will allow us to grow the Company’s management fees and performance fees and (ii) grow the investment portfolio of retirement services, in each case in amounts sufficient to cover our long-term liquidity requirements, which may include:•supporting the future growth of our businesses;•creating new or enhancing existing products and investment platforms;•making payments to policyholders;•pursuing new strategic corporate investment opportunities;•paying interest and principal on the Company’s financing arrangements;•repurchasing common stock;•making payments under the tax receivable agreement;•making payments related to the AOG Unit Payment; and•paying cash dividends.Cash Flow AnalysisThe section below discusses in more detail the Company’s primary sources and uses of cash and the primary drivers of cash flows within the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows:Years ended December 31,(In millions)202220212020Operating Activities$3,789 $1,064 $(1,616)Investing Activities(23,444)(1,552)(838)Financing Activities28,710 109 3,300 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(15)— — Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Cash and Cash Equivalents Held at Consolidated Variable Interest Entities$9,040 $(379)$846 The assets of our consolidated funds and VIEs, on a gross basis, could have a substantial effect on the accompanying statement of cash flows.

Net cash provided by financing activities also reflects proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Senior Notes, partially offset by dividends to common shareholders, distributions to non-controlling interest holders, and repurchases of common stock.Contractual Obligations, Commitments and ContingenciesFor a summary and a description of the nature of the Company’s commitments, contingencies and contractual obligations, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements and “—Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies.” The Company’s commitments are primarily fulfilled through cash flows from operations and financing activities.Consolidated Funds and VIEsThe Company manages its liquidity needs by evaluating unconsolidated cash flows; however, the Company’s financial statements reflect the financial position of Apollo as well as Apollo’s consolidated funds and VIEs (including SPACs). The primary sources and uses of cash at Apollo’s consolidated funds and VIEs include: (a) raising capital from their investors, which have been reflected historically as non-controlling interests of the consolidated subsidiaries in our financial statements, (b) using capital to make investments, (c) generating cash flows from operations through distributions, interest and the realization of investments, (d) distributing cash flow to investors, (e) issuing debt to finance investments (CLOs) and (f) raising capital through SPAC vehicles for future acquisition of targeted entities.Dividends and DistributionsFor information regarding the quarterly dividends and distributions that were made to common stockholders and non-controlling interest holders in the Apollo Operating Group and participating securities, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Although the Company currently expects to pay dividends, we may not pay dividends if, among other things, we do not have the cash necessary to pay the dividends. To the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends, we 92Table of Contentsmay have to borrow funds to pay dividends, or we may determine not to pay dividends. The declaration, payment and determination of the amount of our dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors.Because AGM is a holding company, the primary source of funds for AGM’s dividends are distributions from its operating subsidiaries, AAM and AHL, which are expected to be adequate to fund AGM’s dividends and other cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations. The ability of these operating subsidiaries to make distributions to AGM will depend on satisfying applicable law with respect to such distributions, including surplus and minimum solvency requirements among others, as well as making prior distributions on the AAM and AHL outstanding preferred stock. Moreover, the ability of AAM and AHL to receive distributions from their own respective subsidiaries will continue to depend on applicable law with respect to such distributions. On February 9, 2023, AGM declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of its common stock, which will be paid on February 28, 2023 to holders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2023. Repurchase of SecuritiesShare Repurchase ProgramFor information regarding the Company’s share repurchase program, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.Repurchase of Other SecuritiesWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our other outstanding debt or equity securities through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not we repurchase any of our other securities and the size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined at our discretion.Asset Management LiquidityOur asset management business requires limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of the business. For the asset management business’ longer-term liquidity needs, we expect to continue to fund the asset management business’ operations through management fees and performance fees received. Liquidity needs are also met (to a limited extent) through proceeds from borrowings and equity issuances as described in notes 13 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively. From time to time, if the Company determines that market conditions are favorable after taking into account our liquidity requirements, we may seek to raise proceeds through the issuance of additional debt or equity instruments. At December 31, 2022, the asset management business had $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $0.7 billion of U.S. Treasury securities as well as $1.0 billion of available funds from the 2022 AMH credit facility. Future Debt ObligationsThe asset management business had long-term debt of $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022, which includes notes with maturities in 2024, 2026, 2029, 2030, 2048 and 2050. See note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the asset management business’ debt arrangements.Future Cash FlowsOur ability to execute our business strategy, particularly our ability to increase our AUM, depends on our ability to establish new funds and to raise additional investor capital within such funds. Our liquidity will depend on a number of factors, such as our ability to project our financial performance, which is highly dependent on the funds we manage and our ability to manage our projected costs, fund performance, access to credit facilities, compliance with existing credit agreements, as well as industry and market trends. Also during economic downturns the funds we manage might experience cash flow issues or liquidate entirely. In these situations we might be asked to reduce or eliminate the management fee and performance fees we charge, which could adversely impact our cash flow in the future.93Table of ContentsAn increase in the fair value of the investments of the funds we manage, by contrast, could favorably impact our liquidity through higher management fees where the management fees are calculated based on the net asset value, gross assets or adjusted assets. Additionally, higher performance fees not yet realized would generally result when investments appreciate over their cost basis which would not have an impact on the asset management business’ cash flow until realized.Consideration of Financing Arrangements As noted above, in limited circumstances, the asset management business may issue debt or equity to supplement its liquidity. The decision to enter into a particular financing arrangement is made after careful consideration of various factors, including the asset management business’ cash flows from operations, future cash needs, current sources of liquidity, demand for the asset management business’ debt or equity, and prevailing interest rates.Revolver FacilityUnder the 2022 AMH credit facility, AMH may borrow in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.0 billion and may incur incremental facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250 million plus additional amounts so long as AMH is in compliance with a net leverage ratio not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00. Borrowings under the 2022 AMH credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including without limitation, permitted acquisitions. The 2022 AMH credit facility has a final maturity date of October 12, 2027.Tax Receivable AgreementThe tax receivable agreement provides for the payment to the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes that AGM and its subsidiaries realizes subject to the agreement. For more information regarding the tax receivable agreement, see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.AOG Unit PaymentOn December 31, 2021, holders of AOG Units (other than Athene and Apollo) sold and transferred a portion of such AOG Units to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for an amount equal to $3.66 multiplied by the total number of AOG Units held by such holders immediately prior to such transaction (such payment, the “AOG Unit Payment”). The remainder of the AOG Units held by such holders were exchanged for shares of AGM common stock concurrently with the consummation of the Mergers on January 1, 2022.As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding AOG Unit Payment amount was $351 million, payable in equal installments through December 31, 2024. See note 17 for more information.AthoraAthora is a strategic liabilities platform that acquires and reinsures traditional closed life insurance policies and provides capital and reinsurance solutions to insurers in Europe. In 2017, Apollo made a €125 million commitment to Athora, which was fully drawn as of April 2020. Apollo committed an incremental €58 million in 2020 to purchase new equity interests. Additionally, in 2021, Apollo acquired approximately €21.9 million of new equity interests in Athora.In December 2021, Apollo committed an additional €250 million to purchase new equity interests to support Athora’s ongoing growth initiatives, of which €180 million was drawn as of December 31, 2022.Apollo Asset Management and Athene are minority investors in Athora with a long-term strategic relationship. Through its share ownership, Apollo Asset Management has approximately 19.9% of the total voting power in Athora, and Athene holds shares in Athora representing 10% of the total voting power in Athora. In addition, Athora shares held by funds and other accounts managed by Apollo represent, in the aggregate, approximately 15.1% of the total voting power in Athora.Fund EscrowAs of December 31, 2022, the remaining investments and escrow cash of Fund VII was valued at 112% of the fund’s unreturned capital which was below the required escrow ratio of 115%. As a result, the fund is required to place in escrow 94Table of Contentscurrent and future performance fee distributions to the general partner until the specified return ratio of 115% is met (at the time of a future distribution) or upon liquidation. Realized performance fees currently distributed to the general partner are limited to potential tax distributions and interest on escrow balances per the fund’s partnership agreement.ClawbackPerformance fees from certain of the funds we manage are subject to contingent repayment by the general partner in the event of future losses to the extent that the cumulative performance fees distributed from inception to date exceeds the amount computed as due to the general partner at the final distribution. See “—Overview of Results of Operations—Performance Fees” for the maximum performance fees subject to potential reversal by each fund.Indemnification LiabilityThe asset management business recorded an indemnification liability in the event that the Former Managing Partners, Contributing Partners and certain investment professionals are required to pay amounts in connection with a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the asset management business’ indemnification liability. Retirement Services LiquidityThere are two forms of liquidity relevant to our retirement services business, funding liquidity and balance sheet liquidity. Funding liquidity relates to the ability to fund operations. Balance sheet liquidity relates to the ability to liquidate or rebalance Athene’s balance sheet without incurring significant costs from fees, bid-offer spreads, or market impact. Athene manages its liquidity position by matching projected cash demands with adequate sources of cash and other liquid assets. The principal sources of liquidity for our retirement services business, in the ordinary course of business, are operating cash flows and holdings of cash, cash equivalents and other readily marketable assets.Athene’s investment portfolio is structured to ensure a strong liquidity position over time in order to permit timely payment of policy and contract benefits without requiring asset sales at inopportune times or at depressed prices. In general, liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, highly rated corporate bonds, unaffiliated preferred stock and public common stock, all of which generally have liquid markets with a large number of buyers. Assets included in modified coinsurance and funds withheld portfolios are available to fund the benefits for the associated obligations but are restricted from other uses. Although the investment portfolio of our retirement services business does contain assets that are generally considered illiquid for liquidity monitoring purposes (primarily mortgage loans, policy loans, real estate, investment funds, and affiliated common stock), there is some ability to raise cash from these assets if needed. Athene has access to additional liquidity through the $1.25 billion AHL credit facility, with potential increases up to $1.75 billion, the AHL liquidity facility with a borrowing capacity of $2.5 billion, with potential increases up to $3.0 billion, and $2.0 billion of committed repurchase facilities. The AHL credit facility was undrawn as of December 31, 2022. On February 7, 2023, Athene borrowed $1.0 billion from the AHL liquidity facility for short-term cash flow needs. Athene also has a registration statement on Form S-3 to provide it with access to the capital markets, subject to market conditions and other factors. Athene is also the counterparty to repurchase agreements with several different financial institutions, pursuant to which it may obtain short-term liquidity, to the extent available. In addition, through Athene’s membership in the FHLB, it is eligible to borrow under variable rate short-term federal funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity.Athene proactively manages its liquidity position to meet cash needs while minimizing adverse impacts on investment returns. Athene analyzes its cash-flow liquidity over the upcoming 12 months by modeling potential demands on liquidity under a variety of scenarios, taking into account the provisions of its policies and contracts in force, its cash flow position, and the volume of cash and readily marketable securities in its portfolio. Liquidity risk is monitored, managed and mitigated through a number of stress tests and analyses to assess Athene’s ability to meet its cash flow requirements, as well as the ability of its reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to meet their collateral obligations, under various stress scenarios. Athene further seeks to mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining access to alternative, external sources of liquidity.95Table of ContentsInsurance Subsidiaries’ Operating LiquidityThe primary cash flow sources for Athene’s insurance subsidiaries include retirement services product inflows (premiums and deposits), investment income, principal repayments on its investments, net transfers from separate accounts and financial product inflows. Uses of cash include investment purchases, payments to policyholders for surrenders, withdrawals and payout benefits, interest and principal payments on funding agreements, payments to satisfy pension group annuity obligations, policy acquisition costs and general operating costs.Athene’s policyholder obligations are generally long-term in nature. However, policyholders may elect to withdraw some, or all, of their account value in amounts that exceed our estimates and assumptions over the life of an annuity contract. Athene includes provisions within its annuity policies, such as surrender charges and MVAs, which are intended to protect it from early withdrawals. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 76% of Athene’s deferred annuity liabilities were subject to penalty upon surrender. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 60% of policies contained MVAs that may also have the effect of limiting early withdrawals if interest rates increase, but may encourage early withdrawals by effectively subsidizing a portion of surrender charges when interest rates decrease. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 29% of Athene’s net reserve liabilities were generally non-surrenderable, including funding agreements, group annuities and payout annuities, while 53% were subject to penalty upon surrender.Membership in Federal Home Loan BankThrough its membership in the FHLB, Athene is eligible to borrow under variable rate short-term federal funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity. The borrowings must be secured by eligible collateral such as mortgage loans, eligible CMBS or RMBS, government or agency securities and guaranteed loans. As of December 31, 2022, Athene had no outstanding borrowings under these arrangements.Athene has issued funding agreements to the FHLB. These funding agreements were issued in an investment spread strategy, consistent with other investment spread operations. As of December 31, 2022, Athene had funding agreements outstanding with the FHLB in the aggregate principal amount of $3.7 billion.The maximum FHLB indebtedness by a member is determined by the amount of collateral pledged and cannot exceed a specified percentage of the member’s total statutory assets dependent on the internal credit rating assigned to the member by the FHLB. As of December 31, 2022, the total maximum borrowing capacity under the FHLB facilities was limited to $52.4 billion. However, Athene’s ability to borrow under the facilities is constrained by the availability of assets that qualify as eligible collateral under the facilities and certain other limitations. Considering these limitations, as of December 31, 2022 Athene had the ability to draw up to an estimated $5.8 billion, inclusive of borrowings then outstanding. This estimate is based on Athene’s internal analysis and assumptions and may not accurately measure collateral which is ultimately acceptable to the FHLB.Securities Repurchase AgreementsAthene engages in repurchase transactions whereby it sells fixed income securities to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms or commercial banks, with a concurrent agreement to repurchase such securities at a determined future date. Athene requires that, at all times during the term of the repurchase agreements, it maintains sufficient cash or other liquid assets sufficient to allow it to fund substantially all of the repurchase price. Proceeds received from the sale of securities pursuant to these arrangements are generally invested in short-term investments, with the offsetting obligation to repurchase the security included within payables for collateral on derivatives and securities to repurchase on the consolidated statements of financial condition. As per the terms of the repurchase agreements, Athene monitors the market value of the securities sold and may be required to deliver additional collateral (which may be in the form of cash or additional securities) to the extent that the value of the securities sold decreases prior to the repurchase date.As of December 31, 2022, the payables for repurchase agreements were $4.7 billion, while the fair value of securities and collateral held by counterparties backing the repurchase agreements was $5.0 billion. As of December 31, 2022, payables for repurchase agreements were comprised of $1.9 billion of short-term and $2.9 billion of long-term repurchase agreements. 96Table of ContentsDividends from Insurance SubsidiariesAHL is a holding company whose primary liquidity needs include the cash-flow requirements relating to its corporate activities, including its day-to-day operations, debt servicing, preferred and common stock dividend payments and strategic transactions, such as acquisitions. The primary source of AHL’s cash flow is dividends from its subsidiaries, which are expected to be adequate to fund cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations.The ability of AHL’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is limited by applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where the subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as agreements entered into with regulators. These laws and regulations require, among other things, the insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay.Subject to these limitations and prior notification to the appropriate regulatory agency, Athene’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay ordinary dividends based on calculations specified under insurance laws of the relevant state of domicile. Any distributions above the amount permitted by statute in any twelve month period are considered to be extraordinary dividends, and require the approval of the appropriate regulator prior to payment. AHL does not currently plan on having the U.S. subsidiaries pay any dividends to their parents. Dividends from AHL’s subsidiaries are projected to be the primary source of AHL’s liquidity. Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, each of Athene’s Bermuda insurance subsidiaries is prohibited from paying a dividend in an amount exceeding 25% of the prior year’s statutory capital and surplus, unless at least two members of the board of directors of the Bermuda insurance subsidiary and its principal representative in Bermuda sign and submit to the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”) an affidavit attesting that a dividend in excess of this amount would not cause the Bermuda insurance subsidiary to fail to meet its relevant margins. In certain instances, the Bermuda insurance subsidiary would also be required to provide prior notice to the BMA in advance of the payment of dividends. In the event that such an affidavit is submitted to the BMA in accordance with the Bermuda Insurance Act, and further subject to the Bermuda insurance subsidiary meeting its relevant margins, the Bermuda insurance subsidiary is permitted to distribute up to the sum of 100% of statutory surplus and an amount less than 15% of its total statutory capital. Distributions in excess of this amount require the approval of the BMA.The maximum distribution permitted by law or contract is not necessarily indicative of the insurance subsidiaries’ actual ability to pay such distributions, which may be further restricted by business and other considerations, such as the impact of such distributions on surplus, which could affect Athene’s ratings or competitive position and the amount of premiums that can be written. Specifically, the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from rating agencies, including S&P, A.M. Best, Fitch and Moody’s, is of particular concern when determining the amount of capital available for distributions. AHL believes its insurance subsidiaries have sufficient statutory capital and surplus, combined with additional capital available to be provided by AHL, to meet their financial strength ratings objectives. Finally, state insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory surplus of Athene’s insurance subsidiaries following any dividend or distribution must be reasonable in relation to their outstanding liabilities and adequate for the insurance subsidiaries’ financial needs.Other Sources of FundingAthene may seek to secure additional funding at the AHL level by means other than dividends from subsidiaries, such as by drawing on the undrawn $1.25 billion AHL credit facility, drawing on the remaining $1.5 billion of the AHL liquidity facility or by pursuing future issuances of debt or preference shares to third-party investors. The AHL credit facility contains various standard covenants with which Athene must comply, including maintaining a Consolidated Debt to Capitalization Ratio (as such term is defined in the AHL credit facility) of not greater than 35% at the end of any quarter, maintaining a minimum Consolidated Net Worth (as such term is defined in the AHL credit facility) of no less than $7.3 billion, and restrictions on the ability to incur debt and liens, in each case with certain exceptions. The AHL liquidity facility also contains various standard covenants with which Athene must comply, including maintaining an ALRe minimum Consolidated Net Worth (as such term is defined in the AHL liquidity facility) of no less than $9.3 billion and restrictions on the ability to incur debt and liens, in each case with certain exceptions.97Table of ContentsFuture Debt ObligationsAthene had long-term debt of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022, which includes notes with maturities in 2028, 2030, 2031, 2033, 2051, and 2052. See note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding Athene’s debt arrangements.CapitalAthene believes it has a strong capital position and that it is well positioned to meet policyholder and other obligations. Athene measures capital sufficiency using an internal capital model which reflects management’s view on the various risks inherent to its business, the amount of capital required to support its core operating strategies and the amount of capital necessary to maintain its current ratings in a recessionary environment. The amount of capital required to support Athene’s core operating strategies is determined based upon internal modeling and analysis of economic risk, as well as inputs from rating agency capital models and consideration of both NAIC RBC and Bermuda capital requirements. Capital in excess of this required amount is considered excess equity capital, which is available to deploy. As of December 31, 2022, Athene’s U.S. RBC ratio was 387%, its Bermuda RBC ratio was 407% and its consolidated RBC ratio was 416%. The formulas for determining the amount of RBC specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk.ACRAACRA provides Athene with access to on-demand capital to support its growth strategies and capital deployment opportunities. ACRA provides a capital source to fund both Athene’s inorganic and organic channels, including pension group annuity, funding agreement and retail channels. This strategic capital solution allows Athene the flexibility to simultaneously deploy capital across multiple accretive avenues, while maintaining a strong financial position. Critical Accounting Estimates and PoliciesThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of our accounting policies that are affected most by judgments, estimates and assumptions.Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies - OverallConsolidationWe consolidate entities on a variable interest or voting interest model or, if applicable, apply specialized accounting guidance for investment companies. Significant judgment may be required for the application of the VIE guidance and to determine whether entities qualify as investment companies.The assessment of whether an entity is a variable interest entity and the determination of whether Apollo should consolidate requires judgment. Those judgments include, but are not limited to: (i) determining whether the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (ii) evaluating whether the holders of equity investment at risk, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the success of the entity, (iii) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive the expected residual returns from an entity and (iv) evaluating the nature of the relationship and activities of those related parties with shared power or under common control for purposes of determining which party within the related-party group is most closely associated with the VIE. Judgments are also made in determining whether a member in the equity group has a controlling financial interest, including power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and rights to receive benefits or obligations to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to the VIE. This analysis considers all relevant economic interests, including proportionate interests held through related parties. 98Table of ContentsAdditionally, evaluating an entity to determine whether it meets the characteristics of an investment company is qualitative in nature and may involve significant judgment. The Company has retained this specialized accounting for investment companies in consolidation. Equity-Based Compensation Equity-based compensation is generally measured based on the grant date fair value of the award. Certain RSUs granted by the Company vest subject to continued employment and the Company’s receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods, sufficient to cover the associated equity-based compensation expense. Equity-based compensation expense for such awards, if and when granted, will be recognized on an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period to the extent the performance fee metrics are met or deemed probable. The addition of these performance measures helps to promote the interests of our shareholders and fund investors by making RSU vesting contingent on the realization and distribution of profits on our funds. For more information regarding Apollo’s equity-based compensation awards, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. The Company’s assumptions made to determine the fair value on grant date are embodied in the calculations of compensation expense.A significant part of our compensation expense is derived from amortization of RSUs. The fair value of all RSU grants after March 29, 2011 is based on the grant date fair value, which considers the public share price of AGM. The Company has three types of RSU grants, which we refer to as Plan Grants, Bonus Grants, and Performance Grants. Plan Grants may or may not provide the right to receive dividend equivalents until the RSUs vest and, for grants made after 2011, the underlying shares are generally issued by March 15th after the year in which they vest. For Plan Grants, the grant date fair value is based on the public share price of the Company, and is discounted for transfer restrictions and lack of dividends until vested if applicable. Bonus Grants provide the right to receive dividend equivalents on both vested and unvested RSUs and Performance Grants provide the right to receive dividend equivalents on vested RSUs and may also provide the right to receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs. Both Bonus Grants and Performance Grants are generally issued by March 15th of the year following the year in which they vest. For Bonus Grants and Performance Grants, the grant date fair value for the periods presented is based on the public share price of AGM, and is discounted for transfer restrictions.We utilized the present value of a growing annuity formula to calculate a discount for the lack of pre-vesting dividends on certain Plan Grant and Performance Grant RSUs. The weighted average for the inputs utilized for the shares granted are presented in the table below for Plan Grants and Performance Grants: For the Years Ended December 31, 202220212020Plan Grants:Dividend Yield13.0%3.0%5.0%Cost of Equity Capital Rate312.3%11.7%11.6%Performance Grants:Dividend Yield22.9%2.2%5.1%Cost of Equity Capital Rate312.3%12.0%10.9%1 Calculated based on the historical dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the price of the Company’s common stock as of the measurement date of the grant on a weighted average basis.2 Calculated based on the historical dividends paid during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the price of the Company’s common stock as of the measurement date of the grant on a weighted average basis.3 Assumes a discount rate that was equivalent to the opportunity cost of foregoing distributions on unvested Plan Grant and Performance Grant RSUs as of the valuation date, based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”). CAPM is a commonly used mathematical model for developing expected returns.We utilize the Finnerty Model to calculate a marketability discount on the Plan Grant, Bonus Grant and Performance Grant RSUs to account for the lag between vesting and issuance. The Finnerty Model provides for a valuation discount reflecting the holding period restriction embedded in a restricted security preventing its sale over a certain period of time. The Finnerty Model proposes to estimate a discount for lack of marketability such as transfer restrictions by using an option pricing theory. This model has gained recognition through its ability to address the magnitude of the discount by considering the volatility of a company’s stock price and the length of restriction. The concept underpinning the Finnerty Model is that a restricted security cannot be sold over a certain period of time. Further simplified, a restricted share of equity in a company can be viewed as having forfeited a put on the average price of the marketable equity over the restriction period (also known as an 99Table of Contents“Asian Put Option”). If we price an Asian Put Option and compare this value to that of the assumed fully marketable underlying security, we can effectively estimate the marketability discount. The inputs utilized in the Finnerty Model are (i) length of holding period, (ii) volatility and (iii) dividend yield. The weighted average for the inputs utilized for the shares granted are presented in the table below for Plan Grants, Bonus Grants and Performance Grants: For the Years Ended December 31,202220212020Plan Grants:Holding Period Restriction (in years)1.24.60.6Volatility144.8%32.8%58.8%Dividend Yield23.0%3.0%5.0%Bonus Grants:Holding Period Restriction (in years)0.20.20.2Volatility134.5%34.9%29.2%Dividend Yield22.9%3.9%5.0%Performance Grants:Holding Period Restriction (in years)0.90.61.0Volatility137.4%27.0%47.6%Dividend Yield22.9%2.2%5.1%1 The Company determined the expected volatility based on the volatility of the Company’s common stock price as of the grant date with consideration to comparable companies.2 Calculated based on the historical dividends paid during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the Company’s common stock price as of the measurement date of the grant on a weighted average basis.Income TaxesSignificant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions when the position is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. The Company’s tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether the Company has uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period during which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies - Asset ManagementInvestments, at Fair Value On a quarterly basis, Apollo utilizes valuation committees consisting of members from senior management, to review and approve the valuation results related to the investments of the funds it manages. For certain publicly traded vehicles managed by Apollo, a review is performed by an independent board of directors. The Company also retains external valuation firms to provide third-party valuation consulting services to Apollo, which consist of certain limited procedures that management identifies and requests them to perform. The limited procedures provided by the external valuation firms assist management with validating their valuation results or determining fair value. The Company performs various back-testing procedures to validate their valuation approaches, including comparisons between expected and observed outcomes, forecast evaluations and 100Table of Contentsvariance analyses. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material.The fair values of the investments in the funds we manage can be impacted by changes to the assumptions used in the underlying valuation models. For further discussion on the impact of changes to valuation assumptions see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Sensitivity” in this report. There have been no material changes to the valuation approaches utilized during the periods that our financial results are presented in this report.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsExcept for the Company’s debt obligations (each as defined in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements), Apollo’s financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts whose carrying values approximate fair value. See “—Investments, at Fair Value” above. While Apollo’s valuations of portfolio investments are based on assumptions that Apollo believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the actual realized gains or losses will depend on, among other factors, future operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may ultimately differ significantly from the assumptions on which the valuations were based. Financial instruments’ carrying values generally approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of those instruments or variable interest rates related to the borrowings. Revenue RecognitionPerformance FeesApollo earns performance fees from funds we manage as a result of such funds achieving specified performance criteria. Such performance fees generally are earned based upon a fixed percentage of realized and unrealized gains of various funds after meeting any applicable hurdle rate or threshold minimum. Performance allocations are performance fees that are generally structured from a legal standpoint as an allocation of capital to the Company. Performance allocations from certain of the funds that we manage are subject to contingent repayment and are generally paid to us as particular investments made by the funds are realized. If, however, upon liquidation of a fund, the aggregate amount paid to us as performance fees exceeds the amount actually due to us based upon the aggregate performance of the fund, the excess (in certain cases net of taxes) is required to be returned by us to that fund. We account for performance allocations as an equity method investment, and accordingly, we accrue performance allocations quarterly based on fair value of the underlying investments and separately assess if contingent repayment is necessary. The determination of performance allocations and contingent repayment considers both the terms of the respective partnership agreements and the current fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used. See “Investments, at Fair Value” below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments in our credit, private equity and real assets funds.Incentive fees are performance fees structured as a contractual fee arrangement rather than a capital allocation. Incentive fees are generally received from the management of CLOs, managed accounts and MFIC. For a majority of our incentive fees, once the quarterly or annual incentive fees have been determined, there is no look-back to prior periods for a potential contingent repayment, however, certain other incentive fees can be subject to contingent repayment at the end of the life of the entity. In accordance with the revenue recognition standard, certain incentive fees are considered a form of variable consideration and therefore are deferred until fees are probable to not be significantly reversed. There is significant judgment involved in determining if the incentive fees are probable to not be significantly reversed, but generally the Company will defer the revenue until the fees are crystallized or are no longer subject to clawback or reversal. Management FeesManagement fees related to the yield funds we manage can be based on net asset value, gross assets, adjusted cost of all unrealized portfolio investments, capital commitments, adjusted assets, capital contributions, or stockholders’ equity, all as defined in the respective partnership agreements. The management fee calculations for the yield funds we manage that consider net asset value, gross assets, adjusted cost of all unrealized portfolio investments and adjusted assets are normally based on the terms of the respective partnership agreements and the current fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could 101Table of Contentsvary depending on the valuation methodology that is used. The management fees related to equity funds we manage, by contrast, are generally based on a fixed percentage of the committed capital or invested capital. The corresponding fee calculations that consider committed capital or invested capital are both objective in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or assumptions. The management fees related to the hybrid funds we manage are generally based on net asset value, gross assets, or committed or invested capital. See “Investments, at Fair Value” below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments in the yield, hybrid and equity funds.Profit Sharing Expense Profit sharing expense is primarily a result of agreements with employees to compensate them based on the ownership interest they have in the general partners of the Apollo funds. Therefore, changes in the fair value of the underlying investments in the funds we manage and advise affect profit sharing expense. Employees are generally allocated approximately 30% to 61%, of the total performance fees which is driven primarily by changes in fair value of the underlying fund’s investments and is treated as compensation expense. Additionally, profit sharing expenses paid may be subject to clawback from employees and former employees to the extent not indemnified. When applicable, the accrual for potential clawback of previously distributed profit sharing amounts, which is a component of due from related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition, represents all amounts previously distributed to employees and former employees that would need to be returned to the general partner if the Apollo funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds’ investments as of the reporting date. The actual general partner receivable, however, would not become realized until the end of a fund’s life.Several of the Company’s employee remuneration programs are dependent upon performance fee realizations, including the Incentive Pool, and dedicated performance fee rights and certain RSU awards for which vesting is contingent, in part, on the realization of performance fees in a specified period. The Company established these programs to attract and retain, and provide incentive to, partners and employees of the Company and to more closely align the overall compensation of partners and employees with the overall realized performance of the Company. Dedicated performance fee rights entitle their holders to payments arising from performance fee realizations. The Incentive Pool enables certain employees to earn discretionary compensation based on realized performance fees in a given year, which amounts are reflected in profit sharing expense in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Amounts earned by participants as a result of their performance fee rights (whether dedicated or Incentive Pool) will vary year-to-year depending on the overall realized performance of the Company (and, in the case of the Incentive Pool, on their individual performance). There is no assurance that the Company will continue to compensate individuals through the same types of arrangements in the future and there may be periods when the Company determines that allocations of realized performance fees are not sufficient to compensate individuals, which may result in an increase in salary, bonus and benefits, the modification of existing programs or the use of new remuneration programs. Reductions in performance fee revenues could also make it harder to retain employees and cause employees to seek other employment opportunities.Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies - Retirement ServicesInvestmentsThe Company is responsible for the fair value measurement of investments presented in the consolidated financial statements. The Company performs regular analysis and review of its valuation techniques, assumptions and inputs used in determining fair value to evaluate if the valuation approaches are appropriate and consistently applied, and the various assumptions are reasonable. The Company also performs quantitative and qualitative analysis and review of the information and prices received from commercial pricing services and broker-dealers, to verify it represents a reasonable estimate of the fair value of each investment. In addition, the Company uses both internally-developed and commercially-available cash flow models to analyze the reasonableness of fair values using credit spreads and other market assumptions, where appropriate. For investment funds, the Company typically recognizes its investment, including those for which it has elected the fair value option, based on net asset value information provided by the general partner or related asset manager. For a discussion of investment funds for which it has elected the fair value option, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.102Table of ContentsValuation of Fixed Maturity Securities, Equity Securities and Mortgage LoansThe following table presents the fair value of fixed maturity securities, equity securities and mortgage loans, including those with related parties and those held by consolidated VIEs, by pricing source and fair value hierarchy:December 31, 2022(In millions)TotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3Fixed maturity securitiesAFS securitiesPriced via commercial pricing services$78,335 $2,570 $75,758 $7 Priced via independent broker-dealer quotations23,166 — 20,475 2,691 Priced via models or other methods10,724 — — 10,724 Trading securitiesPriced via commercial pricing services1,087 21 1,066 — Priced via independent broker-dealer quotations506 2 453 51 Priced via models or other methods880 — — 880 Trading securities of consolidated VIEs1,063 5 436 622 Total fixed maturity securities, including related parties and VIEs115,761 2,598 98,188 14,975 Equity securitiesPriced via commercial pricing services995 150 845 — Priced via independent broker-dealer quotations15 — — 15 Priced via models or other methods356 — — 356 Total equity securities, including related parties and VIEs1,366 150 845 371 Mortgage loansPriced via commercial pricing services27,644 — — 27,644 Priced via models or other methods1,112 — — 1,112 Mortgage loans of consolidated VIEs2,055 — — 2,055 Total mortgage loans, including related parties and VIEs30,811 — — 30,811 Total fixed maturity securities, equity securities and mortgage loans, including related parties and consolidated VIEs$147,938 $2,748 $99,033 $46,157 Percent of total100.0 %1.9 %66.9 %31.2 %The Company measures the fair value of its securities based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the assets, which may include inherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset, or nonperformance risk. The estimate of fair value is the price that would be received to sell a security in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market, or the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market, for that security. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange while not under duress. The valuation of securities involves judgment, is subject to considerable variability and is revised as additional information becomes available. As such, changes in, or deviations from, the assumptions used in such valuations can significantly affect the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in security values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. The Company’s ability to sell securities, or the price ultimately realized upon the sale of securities, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain securities. Accordingly, estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.For fixed maturity securities, the Company obtains the fair values, when available, based on quoted prices in active markets that are regularly and readily obtainable. Generally, these are liquid securities and the valuation does not require significant management judgment. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is based on market standard valuation techniques, giving priority to observable inputs. The Company obtains the fair value for most marketable bonds without an active market from several commercial pricing services. The pricing services incorporate a variety of market observable information in their valuation techniques, including benchmark yields, broker-dealer quotes, credit quality, issuer spreads, bids, offers, and other reference data. For certain fixed maturity securities without an active market, an internally-developed discounted cash flow or other approach is utilized to calculate the fair value. A discount rate is used, which adjusts a market 103Table of Contentscomparable base rate for securities with similar characteristics for credit spread, market illiquidity or other adjustments. The fair value of privately placed fixed maturity securities are based on the credit quality and duration of comparable marketable securities, which may be securities of another issuer with similar characteristics. In some instances, the Company uses a matrix-based pricing model, which considers the current level of risk-free interest rates, corporate spreads, credit quality of the issuer, and cash flow characteristics of the security. The Company also considers additional factors, such as net worth of the borrower, value of collateral, capital structure of the borrower, presence of guarantees and its evaluation of the borrower’s ability to compete in its relevant market.For equity securities, the Company obtains the fair value, when available, based on quoted market prices. Other equity securities, typically private equities or equity securities not traded on an exchange, are valued based on other sources, such as commercial pricing services or brokers.The Company has elected the fair value option on its mortgage loan portfolio. The Company uses independent commercial pricing services to value its mortgage loan portfolio. Discounted cash flow analysis is performed through which the loans’ contractual cash flows are modeled and an appropriate discount rate is determined to discount the cash flows to arrive at a present value. Financial factors, credit factors, collateral characteristics and current market conditions are all taken into consideration when performing the discounted cash flow analysis. The Company performs vendor due diligence exercises annually to review vendor processes, models and assumptions. Additionally, the Company reviews price movements on a quarterly basis to ensure reasonableness.Future Policy BenefitsThe future policy benefit liabilities associated with long duration contracts include term and whole-life products, accident and health, disability, and deferred and immediate annuities with life contingencies. Liabilities for non-participating long duration contracts are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods which require Athene to make certain assumptions regarding expenses, investment yields, mortality, morbidity, and persistency, with a provision for adverse deviation, at the date of issue or acquisition. As of December 31, 2022, the reserve investment yield assumptions for non-participating contracts range from 2.3% to 6.6% and are specific to Athene’s expected earned rate on the asset portfolio supporting the reserves. Athene bases other key assumptions, such as mortality and morbidity, on industry standard data adjusted to align with actual company experience, if necessary. Premium deficiency tests are performed periodically using current assumptions, without provisions for adverse deviation, to test the appropriateness of the established reserves. If the reserves using current assumptions are greater than the existing reserves, the excess is recorded and the initial assumptions are revised.Liabilities for Guaranteed Living Withdrawal Benefits and Guaranteed Minimum Death BenefitsAthene issues and reinsures deferred annuity contracts which contain GLWB and GMDB riders. It establishes future policy benefits for GLWB and GMDB by estimating the expected value of withdrawal and death benefits in excess of the projected account balance. Athene recognizes the excess proportionally over the accumulation period based on total actual and expected assessments. The methods used to estimate the liabilities have assumptions about policyholder behavior, which includes lapses, withdrawals and utilization of the benefit riders, mortality, and market conditions affecting the account balance.Projected policyholder lapse and withdrawal behavior assumptions are set in one of two ways. For certain blocks of business, this behavior is a function of Athene’s predictive analytics model which considers various observable inputs. For the remaining blocks of business, these assumptions are set at the product level by grouping individual policies sharing similar features and guarantees and reviewed periodically against experience. Base lapse rates consider the level of surrender charges and are dynamically adjusted based on the level of current interest rates relative to the guaranteed rates and the amount by which any rider guarantees are in a net positive position. Rider utilization assumptions consider the number and timing of policyholders electing the riders. Athene tracks and updates this assumption as experience emerges. Mortality assumptions are set at the product level and generally based on standard industry tables, adjusted for historical experience and a provision for mortality improvement. Projected guaranteed benefit amounts in excess of the underlying account balances are considered over a range of scenarios in order to capture Athene’s exposure to the guaranteed withdrawal and death benefits.The assessments used to accrue liabilities are based on interest margins, rider charges, surrender charges and realized gains (losses). As such, future reserve changes can be sensitive to changes in investment results and the impacts of shadow adjustments, which represent the impact of assuming unrealized gains (losses) are realized in future periods. As of December 31, 2022, the GLWB and GMDB liability balance, including the impacts of shadow adjustments, totaled $5.3 billion. The relative sensitivity of the GLWB and GMDB liability balance from changes to these assumptions, including the impacts of 104Table of Contentsshadow adjustments from hypothetical changes in projected assessments, changes in the discount rate and annual equity growth, has decreased and are not significant following the business combination and purchase accounting election described in note 3. DerivativesValuation of Embedded Derivatives on Indexed AnnuitiesAthene issues and reinsures products, primarily indexed annuity products, or purchases investments that contain embedded derivatives. If Athene determines the embedded derivative has economic characteristics not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for separately, unless the fair value option is elected on the host contract.Indexed annuities and indexed universal life insurance contracts allow the policyholder to elect a fixed interest rate return or an equity market component for which interest credited is based on the performance of certain equity market indices. The equity market option is an embedded derivative, similar to a call option. The benefit reserve is equal to the sum of the fair value of the embedded derivative and the host (or guaranteed) component of the contracts. The fair value of the embedded derivatives represents the present value of cash flows attributable to the indexed strategies. The embedded derivative cash flows are based on assumptions for future policy growth, which include assumptions for expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date, future equity option costs, volatility, interest rates, and policyholder behavior. The embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects Athene’s credit rating. The host contract is established at contract inception as the initial account value less the initial fair value of the embedded derivative and accreted over the policy’s life. Contracts acquired through a business combination which contain an embedded derivative are re-bifurcated as of the acquisition date.In general, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives will not directly correspond to the change in fair value of the hedging derivative assets. The derivatives are intended to hedge the index credits expected to be granted at the end of the current term. The options valued in the embedded derivatives represent the rights of the policyholder to receive index credits over the period indexed strategies are made available to the policyholder, which is typically longer than the current term of the options. From an economic basis, Athene believes it is suitable to hedge with options that align with index terms of our indexed annuity products because policyholder accounts are credited with index performance at the end of each index term. However, because the value of an embedded derivative in an indexed annuity contract is longer-dated, there is a duration mismatch which may lead to differences in the recognition of income and expense for accounting purposes.A significant assumption in determining policy liabilities for indexed annuities is the vector of rates used to discount indexed strategy cash flows. The change in risk free rates is expected to drive most of the movement in the discount rates between periods. Changes to credit spreads for a given credit rating as well as any change to Athene’s credit rating requiring a revised level of nonperformance risk would also be factors in the changes to the discount rate. If the discount rates used to discount the indexed strategy cash flows were to fluctuate, there would be a resulting change in reserves for indexed annuities recorded through the consolidated statements of operations.As of December 31, 2022, Athene had embedded derivative liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy of $5.8 billion. The increase (decrease) to the embedded derivatives on indexed annuity products from hypothetical changes in discount rates is summarized as follows:(In millions)December 31, 2022+100 bps discount rate$(299)–100 bps discount rate331 However, these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables, such as equity price levels and market volatility, which can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values. Therefore, the quantitative impact presented in the table above does not necessarily correspond to the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statements. In determining the ranges, Athene has considered current market conditions, as well as the market level of discount rates that can reasonably be anticipated over the near-term. For additional information regarding sensitivities to interest rate risk and public equity risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Sensitivity”.105Table of ContentsDeferred Acquisition Costs, Deferred Sales Inducements, and Value of Business AcquiredCosts related directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance or investment contracts are deferred to the extent they are recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. These costs consist of commissions and policy issuance costs, as well as sales inducements credited to policyholder account balances. Athene performs periodic tests, including at issuance, to determine if the deferred costs are recoverable. If it is determined that the deferred costs are not recoverable, Athene records a cumulative charge to the current period.Deferred costs related to universal life-type policies and investment contracts with significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are amortized over the lives of the policies, based upon the proportion of the present value of actual and expected deferred costs to the present value of actual and expected gross profits to be earned over the life of the policies. Gross profits include investment spread margins, surrender charge income, policy administration, changes in the GLWB and GMDB reserves, and realized gains (losses) on investments. Current period gross profits for indexed annuities also include the change in fair value of both freestanding and embedded derivatives.The estimates of expected gross profits and margins are based on assumptions using accepted actuarial methods related to policyholder behavior, including lapses and the utilization of benefit riders, mortality, yields on investments supporting the liabilities, future interest credited amounts (including indexed related credited amounts on fixed indexed annuity products), and other policy changes as applicable, and the level of expenses necessary to maintain the policies over their expected lives. Each reporting period, Athene updates estimated gross profits with actual gross profits as part of the amortization process. Athene also periodically revises the key assumptions used in the amortization calculation which results in revisions to the estimated future gross profits. The effects of changes in assumptions are recorded as unlocking in the period in which the changes are made.Athene establishes VOBA for blocks of insurance contracts acquired through the acquisition of insurance entities. The fair value of the liabilities purchased is determined using market participant assumptions at the time of acquisition and represents the amount an acquirer would expect to be compensated to assume the contracts. Athene records the fair value of the liabilities assumed in two components: reserves and VOBA. Reserves are established using best estimate assumptions, plus a provision for adverse deviation where applicable, as of the business combination date. VOBA is the difference between the fair value of the liabilities and the reserves. VOBA can be either positive or negative. Any negative VOBA is recorded to the same financial statement line on the consolidated statements of financial condition as the associated reserves. Positive VOBA is recorded in DAC, DSI and VOBA on the consolidated statements of financial condition.VOBA and negative VOBA are amortized in relation to applicable policyholder liabilities. Significant assumptions which impact VOBA and negative VOBA amortization are consistent with those which impact the measurement of policyholder liabilities.Estimated future gross profits vary based on a number of factors but are typically most sensitive to changes in investment spread margins, which are the most significant component of gross profits. If estimated gross profits for all future years on business in force were to change, including the impacts of shadow adjustments, there would be a resulting increase or decrease to the balances of DAC and DSI recorded as an increase or decrease to amortization of DAC and DSI on the consolidated statements of operations or AOCI.Actual gross profits will depend on actual margins, including the changes in the value of embedded derivatives. The most sensitive assumption in determining the value of the embedded derivative is the vector of rates used to discount the embedded derivative cash flows. If the discount rates used to discount the embedded derivative cash flows were to change, there would be a resulting increase or decrease to the balances of DAC and DSI recorded as an increase or decrease in amortization of DAC and DSI on the consolidated statements of operations.Following the business combination and application of purchase accounting described in note 3, DAC and DSI balances exhibit less sensitivity to hypothetical changes in estimated future gross profits and changes in the embedded derivative discount rate as they are relatively less material following the business combination. VOBA balances do not amortize based on estimated gross profits, and accordingly, are not sensitive to changes to actual or estimated gross profits. 106Table of ContentsRecent Accounting PronouncementsA list of recent accounting pronouncements that are relevant to Apollo and its industries is included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.Contractual Obligations, Commitments and ContingenciesFixed and determinable payments due in connection with the Company’s material contractual obligations are as follows as of December 31, 2022:20232024 - 20252026 - 20272028 and ThereafterTotal (In millions)Asset ManagementOperating lease obligations1$70 $152 $147 $545 $914 Other long-term obligations214 1 — — 15 2022 AMH credit facility31 2 1 — 4 Debt obligations3136 723 662 2,482 4,003 AOG Unit payment 4175 175 — — 350 396 1,053 810 3,027 5,286 Retirement ServicesInterest sensitive contract liabilities20,431 40,875 33,971 78,376 173,653 Future policy benefits2,168 4,115 4,070 44,975 55,328 Other policy claims and benefits129 — — — 129 Dividends payable to policyholders5 9 9 73 96 Debt3153 306 306 4,592 5,357 Securities to repurchase52,036 1,360 1,919 — 5,315 24,922 46,665 40,275 128,016 239,878 Obligations$25,318 $47,718 $41,085 $131,043 $245,164 1 Operating lease obligations excludes $225 million of other operating expenses associated with operating leases. 2 Includes (i) payments on management service agreements related to certain assets and (ii) payments with respect to certain consulting agreements entered into by the Company. Note that a significant portion of these costs are reimbursable by funds.3 The obligations for debt payments include contractual maturities of principal and estimated future interest payments based on the terms of the debt agreements. See note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these debt obligations.4 On December 31, 2021, each holder of AOG Units (other than those held by the Company and Athene) sold a portion of their limited partnership interests to the Company in exchange for the AOG Unit Payment. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.5 The obligations for securities for repurchase payments include contractual maturities of principal and estimated future interest payments based on the terms of the agreements. Future interest payments on floating rate repurchase agreements were calculated using the December 31, 2022 interest rate.Note: Due to the fact that the timing of certain amounts to be paid cannot be determined or for other reasons discussed below, the following contractual commitments have not been presented in the table above.(i)As noted previously, the tax receivable agreement requires us to pay to our Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners 85% of any tax savings received by AGM and its subsidiaries from our step-up in tax basis. The tax savings achieved may not ensure that we have sufficient cash available to pay this liability and we might be required to incur additional debt to satisfy this liability.(ii)Debt amounts related to the consolidated VIEs are not presented in the table above as the Company is not a guarantor of these non-recourse liabilities.(iii)In connection with the Stone Tower acquisition, Apollo agreed to pay the former owners of Stone Tower a specified percentage of any future performance fees earned from certain of the Stone Tower funds, CLOs and strategic investment accounts. In connection with the acquisition of Griffin Capital’s U.S. asset management business on May 3, 2022, Apollo agreed to pay the former owners certain share-based consideration contingent on specified AUM and capital raising thresholds. These contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured to fair value at each reporting period until the obligations are satisfied. See note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the contingent consideration liabilities. (iv)Commitments from certain of our subsidiaries to contribute to the funds we manage and certain related parties.Atlas Securitized Products Holdings LPOn February 8, 2023, the Company and CS undertook the first close of their previously announced transaction whereby certain subsidiaries of Atlas acquired certain assets of the CS Securitized Products Group (the “Transaction”). A subsequent closing was held on February 23, 2023. Under the terms of the Transaction, Atlas has agreed to pay CS $3.3 billion, $0.4 billion of which is deferred until February 8, 2026, and $2.9 billion of which is deferred until February 8, 2028. This deferred purchase price is an obligation first of Atlas, second of AAA, third of AAM, fourth of AHL and fifth of AARe. Each of AARe and AHL has issued an assurance letter to CS for the full deferred purchase obligation amount of $3.3 billion. In exchange for the 107Table of Contentspurchase price, Atlas expects to receive, by the Transaction’s final close, approximately $0.4 billion in cash and a portfolio of senior secured warehouse assets, subject to debt, with approximately $1 billion of tangible equity value (to the extent that the warehouse assets received by Atlas constitute less than $1 billion of tangible equity value, the amount of cash is expected to increase by an offsetting amount). These warehouse assets are senior secured assets at industry standard loan-to-value ratios, structured to investment grade-equivalent criteria, and were approved by Atlas in connection with this Transaction. In addition, Atlas has received an investment management contract to manage certain unrelated assets on behalf of CS, providing for quarterly payments expected to total approximately $1.1 billion net to Atlas over 5 years. Finally, Atlas shall also benefit generally from the net spread earned on its assets in excess of its cost of financing. As a result, the fair value of the liability related to the Company’s assurance letter is not material to the consolidated financial statements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk is the risk of incurring losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. Included in market risk are potential losses in value due to credit and counterparty risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk, equity price risk and inflation risk. In our asset management business, our predominant exposure to market risk is related to our role as investment manager and general partner for the funds we manage and the sensitivity to movements in the fair value of their investments and resulting impact on performance fees and management fee revenues. Our direct investments in the funds we manage also expose us to market risk whereby movements in the fair values of the underlying investments will increase or decrease both net gains (losses) from investment activities and income (loss) from equity method investments.Our retirement services business is exposed to market risk through its investment portfolio, its counterparty exposures, and its hedging and reinsurance activities. Athene’s primary market risk exposures are to credit risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, currency risk and inflation risk. Risk Management FrameworkThe Company’s risk management frameworks are designed to identify, assess and prioritize risks to ensure that senior management understands and can manage our risk profile. Governance over risk exists at both the board level and management level for both the asset management and retirement services businesses. The audit committee of the board of directors of AGM is tasked with reviewing major financial risk exposures of the Company and management’s risk assessment and risk management policies. Asset ManagementIn our asset management business, risks are analyzed across strategies from both a “bottom up” and “top down” perspective. We gather and analyze data, monitor investments and markets in detail, and constantly strive to better quantify, qualify and circumscribe relevant risks.Each risk management process is subject to our overall risk tolerance and philosophy and our asset management enterprise risk management framework. This framework governs all business units within the asset management business and (1) conveys our risk culture; (2) outlines our risk management methodology; (3) identifies key roles and responsibilities, and (4) summarizes our core risk areas including, but not limited to, market, credit and operational risks.Each fund runs its own investment and risk management process subject to our overall risk tolerance and philosophy:•With respect to the yield and hybrid funds we manage, we continuously monitor a variety of markets for attractive trading opportunities, applying a number of traditional and customized risk management metrics to analyze risk related to specific assets or portfolios, as well as, fund-wide risks.•The investment process of the equity funds, we manage involves a detailed analysis of potential acquisitions, and investment management teams assigned to monitor the strategic development, financing and capital deployment decisions of each portfolio investment.The Apollo Global Risk Committee (“AGRC”) is tasked with assisting AAM in monitoring and managing enterprise risk for the asset management business. The AGRC is chaired by a Co-President of AAM and includes other members of senior 108Table of Contentsmanagement of Apollo’s asset management business. Managing risk is the responsibility of all AAM employees. Businesses and investment professionals are responsible for all the risk taken on and managed in their business areas and risk management groups are accountable for providing an objective challenge to, and oversight of, the business’ risk management.Risk management groups, such as the market risk group and credit risk team, of the Company’s asset management business provide summary analysis of fund level market and credit risk to the portfolio managers of the funds managed by Apollo and the heads of the various business units. On a periodic basis, risk owners also provide analyses of select market and credit risk components to various members of senior management. In addition, the business and risk leaders of the Company’s asset management business review specific investments from the perspective of risk mitigation and discusses such analysis with the AGRC or other members of senior management when needed.Retirement ServicesThe processes supporting risk management for our retirement services business are designed to ensure that Athene’s risk profile is consistent with its stated risk appetite and that it maintains sufficient capital and liquidity to support its corporate plan, while meeting the requirements imposed by its policyholders, regulators and other stakeholders. The risk management function at Athene strives to maximize the value of its existing business platform to the Company’s shareholders, preserve the ability to realize business and market opportunities under stressed market conditions, and to withstand the impact of severely adverse events.AHL’s risk management framework includes a governance committee structure that supports accountability in current risk-based decision making and effective risk management. Governance committees are established at three levels: the AHL board of directors, AHL management, and subsidiary management. AHL utilizes a host of assessment tools to monitor and assess its risk profile, results of which are shared with senior management periodically at management level committees, such as the management risk committee (“MRC”) and the management investment and asset liability committee (“MIALC”), and with the AHL board of directors quarterly. Business management retains the primary responsibility for day-to-day management of risk.The risk management team at Athene consists of eight teams: Business and Operational Risk, ALM, Regulatory and Risk Analytics, Derivative Governance & Risk Policy, Derivatives and Structured Solutions, Asset Risk Management, Strategic & Emerging Risk and Risk Operations & Change Management. The risk management team is led by AHL’s Chief Risk Officer, who reports to the chair of the AHL Risk Committee. AHL’s risk management team is comprised of more than 50 dedicated, full-time employees.Asset and Liability ManagementAsset and liability risk management is a joint effort that spans business management and the entire risk management team. Processes established to analyze and manage the risks of Athene’s assets and liabilities include but are not limited to:•analyzing AHL’s liabilities to ascertain their sensitivity to behavioral variations and changes in market conditions and actuarial assumptions;•analyzing interest rate risk, cash flow mismatch, and liquidity risk;•performing scenario and stress analyses to examine their impacts on capital and earnings;•performing cash flow testing and capital modeling;•modeling the values of the derivatives embedded in its policy liabilities so that they can be effectively hedged;•hedging unwanted risks, including from embedded derivatives, interest rate exposures and currency risks;•reviewing its corporate plan and strategic objectives, and identifying prospective risks to those objectives under normal and stressed economic, behavioral and actuarial conditions; and•providing appropriate risk reports that show consolidated risk exposures from assets and liabilities as well as the economic consequences of stress events and scenarios.Market Risk and Management of Market Risk ExposuresAsset ManagementImpact on Management FeesOur management fees are based on one of the following:109Table of Contents•capital commitments to an Apollo fund;•capital invested in an Apollo fund;•the gross, net or adjusted asset value of an Apollo fund, as defined; or•as otherwise defined in the respective agreements.Management fees could be impacted by changes in market risk factors, including (i) changes in invested capital or in market values to below cost, due to which management could consider an investment permanently impaired, in the case of certain funds or (ii) changes in gross or net asset value, for the yield funds. The proportion of our management fees that are based on NAV is dependent on the number and types of funds in existence and the current stage of each fund’s life cycle.Impact on Advisory and Transaction Fees—We earn transaction fees relating to certain yield, hybrid and equity transactions and may obtain reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred. Subsequently, on a quarterly or annual basis, ongoing advisory fees, and additional transaction fees in connection with additional purchases, dispositions, or follow-on transactions, may be earned. Management Fee Offsets and any broken deal costs, if applicable, are reflected as a reduction to advisory and transaction fees. Advisory and transaction fees will be impacted by changes in market risk factors to the extent that they limit our opportunities to engage in yield, hybrid, and equity transactions or impair our ability to consummate such transactions. The impact of changes in market risk factors on advisory and transaction fees is not readily predicted or estimated.Impact on Performance FeesWe earn performance fees from the funds we manage as a result of such funds achieving specified performance criteria. Our performance fees will be impacted by changes in market risk factors. However, several major factors will influence the degree of impact:•the performance criteria for each individual fund in relation to how that fund’s results of operations are impacted by changes in market risk factors;•whether such performance criteria are annual or over the life of the fund;•to the extent applicable, the previous performance of each fund in relation to its performance criteria; and•whether each fund’s performance fee distributions are subject to contingent repayment.As a result, the impact of changes in market risk factors on performance fees will vary widely from fund to fund. The impact is heavily dependent on the prior and future performance of each fund, and therefore is not readily predicted or estimated.Market RiskWe are directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of investments will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk is inherent in each of the investments of the funds we manage, including equity investments, loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, hedging instruments, credit default swaps and derivatives. Just a few of the market conditions that may shift from time to time, thereby exposing us to market risk, include fluctuations in interest, currency exchange rates and credit spreads, equity prices, changes in the implied volatility of interest rates and price deterioration. Volatility in debt and equity markets can impact our pace of capital deployment, the timing of receipt of transaction fee revenues and the timing of realizations. These market conditions could have an impact on the value of fund investments and rates of return. Accordingly, depending on the instruments or activities impacted, market risks can have wide ranging, complex adverse effects on our results from operations and our overall financial condition. We monitor market risk using certain strategies and methodologies which management evaluates periodically for appropriateness. We intend to continue to monitor this risk going forward and continue to monitor our exposure to all market factors.The Company is subject to a concentration risk related to the investors in the funds it manages. There are more than 1,000 investors in Apollo’s active yield, hybrid, and equity funds, and no individual investor accounts for more than 10% of the total committed capital to Apollo’s active funds.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk represents exposure we and the funds we manage have to instruments whose values vary with the change in interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, borrowings, investments in interest bearing securities and 110Table of Contentsderivative instruments. We may seek to mitigate risks associated with the exposures by having the funds take offsetting positions in derivative contracts. Hedging instruments allow us to seek to mitigate risks by reducing the effect of movements in the level of interest rates, changes in the shape of the yield curve, as well as, changes in interest rate volatility. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks may include related derivatives such as options, futures and swaps.Credit RiskCredit risk represents exposure we and the funds we manage have to investments or other activity whose value varies with the change in credit spreads, the change in the probability of default by the borrow or the actual default and failure to repay a loan or contractual obligation. Certain of the funds we manage are subject to certain inherent risks through their investments.Certain entities we manage invest substantially all of their excess cash in open-end money market funds and money market demand accounts, which are included in cash and cash equivalents. The money market funds invest primarily in government securities and other short-term, highly liquid instruments with a low risk of loss. We continually monitor the funds’ performance in order to manage any risk associated with these investments.Certain funds we manage hold derivative instruments that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of such agreements. We seek to minimize risk exposure by limiting the counterparties with which the funds enter into contracts to banks and investment banks who meet established credit and capital guidelines. Counterparty risk may be further mitigated by the exchange of collateral with a counterparty as a form of credit support for derivative transactions. As of December 31, 2022, we do not expect any counterparty to default on its obligations and therefore do not expect to incur any loss due to counterparty default.Certain investments of the funds we manage include lower-rated and comparable quality unrated distressed investments and other instruments. Investments in such debt instruments are accompanied by a greater degree of risk of loss due to default by the issuer because such debt instruments are generally unsecured and subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. These issuers generally have high levels of indebtedness and can be more sensitive to adverse market conditions, such as a recession or increasing interest rates, as compared to higher rated issuers. We seek to minimize risk exposure by subjecting each prospective investment to rigorous credit analysis and by making investment decisions based upon objectives that include capital preservation and appreciation, and industry and issuer diversification.Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange risk represents exposures the funds we manage have to changes in the values of current fund holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies and investments in non-U.S. companies. The types of investments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans, foreign currency-denominated transactions, and various foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates or foreign interest rates. Instruments used to mitigate this risk are foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures and forwards. These instruments may be used to help insulate the funds we manage against losses that may arise due to volatile movements in foreign exchange rates and/or interest rates.In our capacity as investment manager of the funds we manage, we continuously monitor a variety of markets for attractive opportunities for managing risk. For example, certain of the funds we manage may put in place foreign exchange hedges or borrowings with respect to certain foreign currency denominated investments to provide a hedge against foreign exchange exposure.Non-U.S. OperationsWe have offices and conduct business throughout the world and are continuing to expand into foreign markets. Our fund investments and our revenues are primarily derived from our U.S. operations. With respect to our non-U.S. operations, we are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments and changes in legislation relating to non-U.S. ownership. The funds we manage also invest in the securities of companies which are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions. As we continue to expand globally, we will continue to focus on monitoring and managing these risk factors as they relate to specific non-U.S. investments.111Table of ContentsRetirement ServicesCredit Risk and Counterparty RiskTo operate Athene’s business model, which is based on generating spread related earnings, it must bear credit risk. However, as Athene assumes credit risk through its investment, reinsurance and hedging activities, it endeavors to ensure that risk exposures remain diversified, that it is adequately compensated for the risks it assumes and that the level of risk is consistent with its risk appetite and objectives.Credit risk is a key risk taken in the asset portfolio, as the credit spread on Athene’s investments is what drives its spread related earnings. Athene manages credit risk by avoiding idiosyncratic risk concentrations, understanding and managing its systematic exposure to economic and market conditions through stress testing, monitoring investment activity daily and distinguishing between price and default risk from credit exposures. Concentration and portfolio limits are designed to ensure that exposure to default and impairment risk is sufficiently modest to not represent a solvency risk, even in severe economic conditions.The approach to taking credit risk in our retirement services business is formulated based on:•a fundamental view on existing and potential opportunities at the security level;•an assessment of the current risk/reward proposition for each market segment;•identification of downside risks and assigning a probability for those risks; and•establishing a plan for best execution of the investment action.A dedicated set of AHL risk managers monitor the asset risks to ensure that such risks are consistent with Athene’s risk appetite, standards for committing capital, and overall strategic objectives. Athene’s risk management team is also a key contributor to the credit impairment evaluation process.In addition to credit-risk exposures from its investment portfolio, Athene is also exposed to credit risk from its counterparty exposures from its derivative hedging and reinsurance activities. Derivative counterparty risk is managed by trading on a collateralized basis with counterparties under International Swaps and Derivatives Association documents with a credit support annex having low or zero-dollar collateral thresholds.Athene utilizes reinsurance to mitigate risks that are inconsistent with its strategy or objectives. For example, Athene has reinsured much of the mortality risk it would otherwise have accumulated through its various acquisitions, allowing it to focus on its core annuity business. These reinsurance agreements expose Athene to the credit risk of its counterparties. Athene manages this risk to avoid counterparty risk concentrations through various mechanisms: utilization of reinsurance structures such as funds withheld or modco to retain ownership of the assets and limit counterparty risk to the cost of replacing the counterparty; diversification across counterparties; and when possible, novating policies to eliminate counterparty risk altogether.Interest Rate Risk—Significant interest rate risk may arise from mismatches in the timing of cash flows from Athene’s assets and liabilities. Management of interest rate risk at the company-wide level, and at the various operating company levels, is one of the main risk management activities in which AHL senior management engages.Depending upon the materiality of the risk and an assessment of how Athene would perform across a spectrum of interest rate environments, it may seek to mitigate interest rate risk using on-balance-sheet strategies (portfolio management) or off-balance-sheet strategies (derivative hedges such as interest rate swaps and futures). Athene monitors ALM metrics (such as key-rate durations and convexity) and employs quarterly cash flow testing requirements across all of its insurance companies to assure the asset and liability portfolios are managed to maintain net interest rate exposures at levels that are consistent with its risk appetite. Athene has established a set of exposure and stress limits to communicate its risk tolerance and to ensure adherence to those risk tolerance levels. Risk management personnel and the MRC and/or MIALC (together, management committees) are notified in the event that risk tolerance levels are exceeded. Depending on the specific risk threshold that is exceeded, the appropriate management committee then makes a decision as to what actions, if any, should be undertaken.Active portfolio management is performed by our asset management business, with direction from the management committees. ALM risk is also managed by the management committees. The performance of Athene’s investment portfolio is reviewed periodically by the AHL management committees and board of directors. The management committees strive to improve returns to shareholders and protect policyholders, while dynamically managing the risk within Athene’s expectations.112Table of ContentsEquity Risk—Athene’s FIAs require it to make payments to policyholders that are dependent on the performance of equity market indices. Athene seeks to minimize the equity risk from its liabilities by economically defeasing this equity exposure with granular, policy-level-based hedging. In addition, Athene’s investment portfolio can be invested in strategies involving public and private equity positions, though in general, it has limited appetite for passive, public equity investments.The equity index hedging framework implemented is one of static and dynamic replication. Unique policy-level liability options are matched with static OTC options and residual risk arising from policyholder behavior and other trading constraints (for example minimum trade size) are managed dynamically by decomposing the risk of the portfolio (asset and liability positions) into market risk measures which are managed to pre-established risk limits. The portfolio risks are measured overnight and rebalanced daily to ensure that the risk profile remains within risk appetite. Valuation is done at the position level, and risks are aggregated and shown at the level of each underlying index. Risk measures that have term structure sensitivity, such as index volatility risk and interest rate risk, are monitored and risk managed along the term structure.Athene is also exposed to equity risk in its alternative investment portfolio. The form of those investments is typically a limited partnership interest in a fund. Athene currently targets fund investments that have characteristics resembling fixed income investments versus those resembling pure equity investments, but as holders of partnership positions, Athene’s investments are generally held as equity positions. Alternative investments are comprised of several categories, including at the most liquid end of the spectrum “liquid strategies”, (which is mostly exposure to publicly traded equities), followed by “differentiated investments”, “yield”, “equity” and “hybrid” strategies. Athene’s alternatives portfolio also includes strategic equity investments in origination platforms, insurance platforms and others.Athene’s investment mandate in its alternative investment portfolio is inherently opportunistic. Each investment is examined and analyzed on its own merits to gain a full understanding of the risks present, and with a view toward determining likely return scenarios, including the ability to withstand stress in a downturn. Athene has a strong preference for alternative investments that have some or all of the following characteristics, among others: (1) investments that constitute a direct investment or an investment in a fund with a high degree of co-investment; (2) investments with credit- or debt-like characteristics (for example, a stipulated maturity and par value), or alternatively, investments with reduced volatility when compared to pure equity; or (3) investments that Athene believes have less downside risk.The alternative investment portfolio is monitored to ensure diversification across asset classes and strategy, and the portfolio's performance under stress scenarios is evaluated routinely as part of management and board reviews. Since alternative investments are marked-to-market on the balance sheet, risk analyses focus on potential changes in market value across a variety of market stresses.Currency Risk—Athene manages its currency risk to maintain minimal exposure to currency fluctuations. It attempts to hedge completely the currency risk arising in its investment portfolio, funding agreements or indexed annuity liabilities. In general, Athene matches currency exposure of assets and liabilities. When the currency denominations of the assets and liabilities do not match, Athene generally undertakes hedging activities to eliminate or mitigate currency mismatch risk.Inflation Risk—Athene manages its inflation risk to maintain minimal exposure to changes in purchasing power. In general, it attempts to match inflation exposure of assets and liabilities. When the inflation exposure profiles of assets and liabilities do not match, Athene generally undertakes hedging activities to eliminate or mitigate inflation mismatch risk. Athene attempts to hedge the majority of inflation risk arising from the pension group annuity business that it reinsures.Scenario Analysis— Athene evaluates exposure to credit risk by analyzing its portfolio’s performance during simulated periods of economic stress. Athene manages business, capital and liquidity needs to withstand stress scenarios and target capital it believes will maintain its current ratings in a moderate recession scenario and maintain investment grade ratings under a deep recession scenario, a substantially severe financial crisis akin to the Lehman scenario in 2008. In the recession scenario, Athene calibrates recessionary shocks to several key risk factors (including but not limited to default rates, recoveries, credit spreads and U.S. Treasury yields) using data from the 1991, 2001, and 2008 recessions, and estimate impacts to the various sectors in its portfolio. In the deep recession scenario, Athene uses default probabilities from the 2008-2009 period, along with recovery and ratings migration rates, to estimate impairment impacts, and uses credit spread and interest rate movements from the 2008–2009 period to estimate mark to market changes. Management reviews the impacts of its stress test analyses on a quarterly basis.113Table of ContentsSensitivitiesAsset ManagementInterest Rate RiskWe are primarily subject to interest rate risk through the investments of the funds we manage. For funds that pay management fees based on NAV or other bases that are sensitive to market value fluctuations, we anticipate our management fees would change consistent with the increase or decrease experienced by the underlying funds’ portfolios. In the event that interest rates were to increase by one percentage point, we estimate that management fees earned that were dependent upon estimated fair value would decrease by approximately $9 million and $41 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Credit RiskSimilar to interest rate risk, we are also subject to credit risk through the investments of the funds we manage. In the event that credit spreads were to increase by one percentage point, we estimate that management fees earned that were dependent upon estimated fair value would decrease by approximately $18 million and $51 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Foreign Exchange RiskWe estimate for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, a 10% decline in the rate of exchange of all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would result in the following declines in management fees and investment income (loss):Years ended December 31,(In millions)20222021Management fees$21 $20 Investment income (loss)9 19 Net Gains from Investment Activities and Principal Investment IncomeOur assets and unrealized gains, and our related equity and net income are sensitive to changes in the valuations of the underlying investments of the funds we manage and could vary materially as a result of changes in our valuation assumptions and estimates. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies—Investments, at Fair Value” for details related to the valuation methods that are used and the key assumptions and estimates employed by such methods. We also quantify the Level 3 investments that are included on our consolidated statements of financial condition by valuation methodology in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. We employ a variety of valuation methods. Furthermore, the investments that we manage but are not on our consolidated statements of financial condition, and therefore impact performance fees, also employ a variety of valuation methods of which no single methodology is used more than any other. Management FeesManagement fees are primarily based on the net asset value of the relevant fund, gross assets, adjusted equity, capital commitments, invested capital, or as defined in the respective fund’s management agreements. Changes in the fair values of the investments that earn management fees based on net asset value, gross assets or adjusted equity will have a direct impact on the amount of management fees that are earned. Management fees earned that were dependent upon estimated fair value during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 would decrease by approximately $51 million and $112 million, respectively, if the fair values of the investments held by such funds were 10% lower during the same respective periods.Management fees for equity and certain hybrid funds we manage are generally charged on either (a) a fixed percentage of committed capital over a stated investment period or (b) a fixed percentage of invested capital of unrealized portfolio investments. Changes in values of investments could indirectly affect future management fees from such funds by, among other things, reducing the funds’ access to capital or liquidity and their ability to currently pay the management fees or if such change resulted in a write-down of investments below their associated invested capital.114Table of ContentsInvestment Income (Loss)Performance Fees—Performance fees from the funds we manage generally are earned based on achieving specified performance criteria and is impacted directly by changes in the fair value of the funds’ investments. We anticipate that a 10% decline in the fair values of investments held by all of the funds we manage would decrease performance fees by approximately $1.1 billion at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Principal Investment Income—For select funds managed by Apollo, our share of income from equity method investments as a general partner in such funds is derived from unrealized gains or losses on investments in funds included in the consolidated financial statements. For funds in which we have an interest, but are not consolidated, our share of investment income is limited to our direct investments in the funds.We anticipate that a 10% decline in the fair value of investments at December 31, 2022 and 2021 would result in an approximate $235 million and $203 million decrease in principal investment income in our consolidated financial statements, respectively.Retirement ServicesInterest Rate RiskAthene assesses interest rate exposure for financial assets and liabilities using hypothetical stress tests and exposure analyses. Assuming all other factors are constant, if there was an immediate parallel increase in interest rates of 25 basis points from levels as of December 31, 2022, Athene estimates a net decrease to its point-in-time pre-tax income from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of $707 million. The net change in fair value for these financial instruments would directly impact the current period gross profits and assessments used in the calculations of DAC and DSI amortization and changes to rider reserves, resulting in an offsetting increase to Athene’s pre-tax income of $23 million. If there was a similar parallel increase in interest rates from levels as of December 31, 2021, Athene estimates a net decrease to its point-in-time pre-tax income from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of $511 million with an offsetting increase to pre-tax income of $17 million from DAC, DSI and VOBA amortization and changes in rider reserves. The increase in sensitivity to point-in-time pre-tax income from changes in the fair value of financial instruments in the estimated outcome as of December 31, 2022, when compared to December 31, 2021, was primarily due to the election of the fair value accounting option for Athene’s mortgage loan portfolio. The financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. These financial instruments include derivative instruments, embedded derivatives and certain fixed maturity securities. The sensitivity analysis excludes those financial instruments carried at fair value for which changes in fair value are recognized in equity, such as AFS fixed maturity securities. Assuming a 25 basis point increase in interest rates that persists for a 12-month period, the estimated impact to spread related earnings would be an increase of approximately $30 – $40 million, and a 25 basis point decrease would generally result in a similar decrease. This is driven by a change in investment income from floating rate assets and liabilities, offset by DAC and DSI amortization and rider reserve change, all calculated without regard to future changes to assumptions. Athene is unable to make forward-looking estimates regarding the impact on net income (loss) of changes in interest rates that persist for a period of time as a result of an inability to determine how such changes will affect certain of the items that Athene characterizes as “adjustments to income (loss) before income taxes” in its reconciliation between net income (loss) available to AHL common shareholder and spread related earnings. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures” for the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to AGM common stockholders to adjusted net income, of which spread related earnings is a component. The impact of changing rates on these adjustments is likely to be significant. See above for a discussion regarding the estimated impact on net income (loss) of an immediate, parallel increase in interest rates of 25 basis points from levels as of December 31, 2022, which discussion encompasses the impact of such an increase on certain of the adjustment items. The models used to estimate the impact of a 25 basis point change in market interest rates incorporate numerous assumptions, require significant estimates and assume an immediate change in interest rates without any discretionary management action to counteract such a change. Consequently, potential changes in Athene’s valuations indicated by these simulations will likely be different from the actual changes experienced under any given interest rate scenarios and these differences may be material. Because Athene actively manages its assets and liabilities, the net exposure to interest rates can vary over time. However, any such decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, unless related to credit concerns of the issuer requiring recognition 115Table of Contentsof credit losses, would generally be realized only if Athene were required to sell such securities at losses to meet liquidity needs.Public Equity RiskAthene assesses public equity market risk for financial assets and liabilities using hypothetical stress tests and exposure analyses. Assuming all other factors are constant, if there was a decline in public equity market prices of 10% as of December 31, 2022, Athene estimates a net decrease to its pre-tax income from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of $269 million. The net change in fair value for these financial instruments would directly impact the current period gross profits and assessments used in the calculations of DAC and DSI amortization and changes in rider reserves, resulting in an offsetting increase to its pre-tax income of $20 million. As of December 31, 2021, Athene estimates that a decline in public equity market prices of 10% would cause a net decrease to its pre-tax income from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of $392 million with an offsetting increase to its pre-tax income of $131 million from DAC, DSI and VOBA amortization and changes in rider reserves. The decline in the DAC, DSI and VOBA amortization as of December 31, 2022, when compared to that as of December 31, 2021, is driven by the decline in the market value of the equity options. The financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. These financial instruments include public equity investments, derivative instruments and the FIA embedded derivative.116Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:42:25.215258
