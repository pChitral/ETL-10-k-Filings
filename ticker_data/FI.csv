798354,FI,FISERV INC,2017,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows: •Overview. This section contains background information on our company and the services and products that we provide, our enterprise priorities and the trends affecting our industry in order to provide context for management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations.•Critical accounting policies and estimates. This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.•Results of operations. This section contains an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2016 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2015 and by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2015 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2014.•Liquidity and capital resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2016.16Table of ContentsOverview Company BackgroundWe are a leading global provider of financial services technology. We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve over 12,000 clients worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants, mutual savings banks, and building societies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature.Our operations are principally located in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment and the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, person-to-person payment services, debit and credit card processing and services, and other electronic payments software and services. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts, credit unions, and leasing and finance companies with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Corporate and Other primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses including share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance.During the first quarter of 2016, we acquired two businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $265 million. We acquired the Convenience Pay Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, which enables providers to accept electronic payments from their consumers through multiple channels, thereby expanding our biller solution offerings. We also completed our purchase of the Community Financial Services business of ACI Worldwide, Inc., further enhancing our suite of digital banking and payments solutions.During 2016, StoneRiver Group, L.P. (“StoneRiver”), a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest, and in 2015 and 2014, recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses. Our pre-tax share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was $146 million in 2016, $29 million in 2015 and $87 million in 2014, with related tax expenses of $54 million, $13 million and $36 million, respectively. In addition, we received cash dividends of $151 million, $36 million and $110 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, from StoneRiver, which were funded from the sale transactions.Enterprise PrioritiesWe continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2017 are: (i) to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and (iii) to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.Industry TrendsThe market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly. The financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment, deposit, lending, investment and risk management products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, regulatory conditions and cybersecurity scrutiny have continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. For example, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and may continue to generate, new regulations impacting the financial industry. These conditions, along with mild economic improvement, have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as “digital channels.”This increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial 17Table of Contentsinstitutions. We expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes amidst an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. Based on these market conditions, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth. Furthermore, we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients.In addition to the trends described above, the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. An acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system, or elects to move to one of our systems, and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected. Financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts, which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi-year contract is acquired by another financial institution. These fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. Our revenue is diversified, and our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model, and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25% of our annual revenue. In addition, we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates.AcquisitionsFrom time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible AssetsWe review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test, the extent 18Table of Contentsto which a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry, and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test.The first step in the quantitative test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets, goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the quantitative test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions.Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2016 determined that our goodwill was not impaired. The estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values, except for a single reporting unit that exceeded the carrying value to a lesser magnitude given the short passage of time between the recent acquisition date and when we performed our most recent annual impairment assessment.We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionThe majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. At times, however, judgment is exercised in evaluating revenue recognition, such as when a contract arrangement includes multiple product and service deliverables. Due to the quantity, size and nature of our multiple element arrangements, the judgments we make in this regard are not likely to have a material impact on revenue recognition for any individual element. Additionally, given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Results of OperationsComponents of Revenue and ExpensesThe following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue, which in 2016 represented 84% of our total revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses.ProductProduct revenue, which in 2016 represented 16% of our total revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales which represented less than 4% of our total revenue. Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue.19Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses.Financial ResultsThe following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year.

The increase in total revenue during 2016 was due to 8% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 1% revenue growth in our Financial segment as compared to 2015. The increase in total revenue during 2015 was attributable to 4% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 3% revenue growth in our Financial segment as compared to 2014. Revenue in our Payments segment increased $228 million, or 8%, in 2016 and increased $115 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to the prior years. Payments segment revenue growth during 2016 and 2015 was driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $175 million, or 8%, and increased $129 million, or 6%, respectively, over the prior years. The growth in both years was primarily due to new client additions and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services, electronic payments and digital channels businesses, as well as our biller solutions business in 2015. In 2016, Payments segment revenue growth was positively impacted by revenue from acquired businesses totaling $86 million and an increase in product revenue of $53 million, or 8%, compared to 2015, primarily due to increased volumes in our output solutions business, including a higher level of card manufacturing and personalization. The revenue growth in 2015 was partially offset by lower software license revenue as compared to 2014.Revenue in our Financial segment increased $34 million, or 1%, in 2016 and increased $76 million, or 3% in 2015 compared to the prior years. In both 2016 and 2015, Financial segment revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased processing and services revenue in our account processing and lending businesses, including higher contract termination fee revenue in 2015, as compared to the prior years. This growth was partially offset by lower revenue in our international business in 2016 and by negative foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 70 basis points in 2015.21Table of ContentsTotal ExpensesTotal expenses increased $117 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $87 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 73.8%, 75.1% and 76.1% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 47.8% in 2016 compared to 49.4% in 2015 and 51.3% in 2014. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2016 and 2015 by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, as well as by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that have benefited our overall cost structure. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue in 2016 was also favorably impacted by lower amortization related to certain fully amortized acquisition-related intangible assets.Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 84.9% in 2016 compared to 86.7% in 2015 and 84.7% in 2014. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was favorably impacted in 2016 by an increase in higher-margin software license revenue and negatively impacted in 2015 by increased expenses in our output solutions business associated with additional investments to expand our card manufacturing and personalization capacity. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 20.0%, 19.7% and 19.2% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was primarily due to acquisition and related integration costs in 2016 as compared to 2015 and increased share-based compensation and incremental costs associated with data center and real estate consolidation activities in 2015 as compared to 2014.Operating Income and Operating MarginTotal operating income increased $134 million, or 10%, in 2016 and increased $101 million, or 8%, in 2015 compared to the prior years. Total operating margin increased to 26.2% in 2016 from 24.9% in 2015 and 23.9% in 2014. Operating income and operating margin improvements in 2016 and 2015 were driven by revenue growth and operational effectiveness initiatives.Operating income in our Payments segment increased $103 million, or 12%, and increased $72 million, or 9%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 30.5%, 29.3% and 28.0% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, improving 120 basis points in 2016 and 130 basis points in 2015. The increases in operating income and operating margin in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in a number of our businesses, along with increased volumes and product mix in our output solutions business in 2016. Payments segment operating margin improvement was partially offset in 2016 by the dilutive margin impact from acquisitions and in 2015 by increased expenses associated with additional investments in our biller and output solutions businesses, along with a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue compared to the prior year.Operating income in our Financial segment was generally consistent in 2016 and increased $53 million, or 7%, in 2015 compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 33.2%, 33.8% and 32.6% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, decreasing 60 basis points in 2016 and improving 120 basis points in 2015. Operating income and operating margin in 2016 were negatively impacted by product mix, lower international revenue and increased expenses associated with incremental investments in innovation-based solutions. Operating income and operating margin were positively impacted in 2015 by revenue growth, including higher contract termination fee revenue, along with operational effectiveness initiatives and scale efficiencies primarily in our account processing businesses.The operating loss in Corporate and Other decreased $34 million in 2016 and increased $24 million in 2015 compared to the prior years. The operating loss improvement in 2016 was primarily due to lower amortization related to certain fully amortized acquisition-related intangible assets, partially offset by acquisition and related integration costs, including a $10 million non-cash impairment charge associated with the decision to replace existing software with an acquired solution. The operating loss increase in 2015 was attributable to increased costs incurred in conjunction with the achievement of our operational effectiveness objectives, including incremental costs related to data center and real estate consolidation activities, as compared to the prior year.Interest ExpenseInterest expense decreased $7 million in 2016 and increased $6 million in 2015 compared to the prior years. The higher interest expense in 2015 was primarily due to the reclassification of $7 million to interest expense for unamortized losses on settled cash flow hedges related to the early extinguishment of debt.Interest and Investment (Loss) Income The net interest and investment loss in 2016 was attributable to a non-cash write-off of a $7 million cost-method investment.22Table of ContentsLoss on Early Debt ExtinguishmentIn May 2015, we redeemed our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in 2016 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.8% senior notes due in 2017, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $85 million related to make-whole payments and other costs associated with redemption.Income Tax ProvisionIncome tax provision as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate was 38.6% in 2016, 35.7% in 2015 and 36.6% in 2014. The higher rate in 2016 and lower rate in 2015 compared to the prior years were primarily due to the level of income tax expense associated with our share of the net gains on the sales by our unconsolidated affiliate, StoneRiver, of a business interest in 2016 and subsidiary businesses in 2015.Income from Investment in Unconsolidated AffiliateOur share of the income of StoneRiver was $147 million, $32 million and $91 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During 2016, StoneRiver recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest, and in 2015 and 2014, recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses. Our pre-tax share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was $146 million in 2016, $29 million in 2015 and $87 million in 2014.Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing OperationsNet income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $4.15 in 2016 and $2.99 in both 2015 and 2014. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted from our share of net investments gains, primarily from StoneRiver capital transactions, of $0.39, $0.07 and $0.20 per share in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and was negatively impacted in 2016 by merger and integration costs of $0.17 per share and in 2015 by debt extinguishment and refinancing costs of $0.25 per share. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.46, $0.53 and $0.52 per share in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralOur primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $300 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

This increase was primarily due to improved operating results and an increase in cash dividends 23Table of Contentsreceived from our StoneRiver joint venture, partially offset by lower cash inflow from net working capital changes primarily related to timing of receivable collections.Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 5% and 7% of our total revenue in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2015 include $70 million related to our Atlanta facility consolidation, consisting primarily of leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment, of which $25 million is offset by landlord reimbursements included in net changes in working capital and other.In 2016 and 2015, we received cash dividends of $151 million and $36 million, respectively, from our StoneRiver joint venture. These dividends, in their entirety, represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities. In addition, we acquired the Convenience Pay Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and the Community Financial Services business of ACI Worldwide, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $265 million during 2016. We funded these acquisitions by utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility.Share RepurchasesWe purchased $1.20 billion and $1.47 billion of our common stock in 2016 and 2015, respectively. On each of November 18, 2015 and November 16, 2016, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 20.5 million shares remaining under these authorizations. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans.Indebtedness December 31,(In millions)2016 2015Revolving credit facility$647 $379Term loan629 6282.7% senior notes due 2020845 8434.625% senior notes due 2020448 4484.75% senior notes due 2021398 3973.5% senior notes due 2022695 6943.85% senior notes due 2025893 893Other borrowings7 11Long-term debt (including current maturities)$4,562 $4,293At December 31, 2016, our long-term debt consisted primarily of $3.3 billion of senior notes, $647 million of revolving credit facility borrowings and $629 million of term loan borrowings. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2016. Revolving Credit FacilityWe maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that matures in April 2020. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings was 1.81% at December 31, 2016. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to: (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended.Term LoanWe maintain a term loan with a syndicate of banks that matures in October 2018 and bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 2.02% at December 31, 2016. A scheduled principal payment of $90 million is 24Table of Contentsdue on December 31, 2017, with the outstanding principal balance of $540 million due at maturity. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above. Senior NotesIn May 2015, we completed an offering of $1.75 billion of senior notes comprised of $850 million aggregate principal amount of 2.7% senior notes due in June 2020 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 3.85% senior notes due in June 2025. The notes pay interest at the stated rates semi-annually on June 1 and December 1, which commenced on December 1, 2015. Our 4.625% senior notes due in October 2020 and 3.5% senior notes due in October 2022 pay interest at the stated rates on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Our 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021 pay interest at the stated rate on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. In October 2015, we used our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility to repay the $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes.In May 2015, we used the net proceeds from the offering described above to redeem our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in June 2016 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017. We recorded a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $85 million related to make-whole payments and other costs associated with this redemption. In addition, we paid scheduled December 2015 and December 2016 principal payments on the term loan totaling $180 million and repaid, at that time, outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The remaining net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes.OtherAccess to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities.The interest rates payable on our senior notes, revolving credit facility and term loan are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing. The following table details our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016:(In millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsLong-term debt including interest (1) (2) $5,297 $241 $818 $2,513 $1,725Minimum operating lease payments (1) 424 107 159 63 95Purchase obligations (1) 411 226 163 22 —Income tax obligations 45 9 20 12 4Total $6,177 $583 $1,160 $2,610 $1,824(1)Interest, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis.(2)The calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, no additional refinancing or lending occurs, and the variable rates on the revolving credit facility and term loan are priced at the rate in effect as of December 31, 2016.25Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency. Our senior management actively monitors these risks.We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt. Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at December 31, 2016, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2017 by approximately $13 million.In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested into short-term, highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. Subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity. During 2016, the subscriber funds daily average balance approximated $1.2 billion. A 1% increase or decrease in applicable interest rates would not have a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations.We conduct business in the United States and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately $86 million as of December 31, 2016 to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. In 2016, approximately 5% of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2016, there would not have been a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position.26Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:20:18.566848

This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2017.15Table of ContentsOverview Company BackgroundWe are a leading global provider of financial services technology. We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve over 12,000 clients worldwide, including banks, savings banks, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, billers, retailers, merchants, and building societies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature.Our operations are principally located in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment and the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, account-to-account transfers, person-to-person payment services, debit and credit card processing and services, payments infrastructure services, and other electronic payments software and services. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, credit unions, and leasing and finance companies with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Corporate and Other primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses including share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance.Acquisitions and DispositionsWe frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of businesses to execute on our strategy. We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; an opportunity to change industry dynamics; a way to achieve business scale; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies.During 2017, we completed four acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $384 million, net of $33 million of acquired cash, along with earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $15 million. In January 2017, we completed our acquisition of Online Banking Solutions, Inc. (“OBS”), a provider of cash management and digital business banking solutions that complement and enrich our existing solutions. In July 2017, we acquired the assets of PCLender, LLC (“PCLender”), a leader in internet-based mortgage software and mortgage lending technology solutions. The OBS and PCLender acquisitions are included in the Financial segment as their products are integrated across a number of our account processing solutions and will enable our bank and credit union clients to better serve their commercial and mortgage customers. In August 2017, we acquired Dovetail Group Limited (“Dovetail”), a leading provider of bank payments and liquidity management solutions. In September 2017, we completed our acquisition of Monitise plc (“Monitise”), a provider of digital solutions that enables innovative digital banking experiences for leading financial institutions worldwide. The Dovetail and Monitise acquisitions are included in the Payments segment and will further enable us to help financial institutions around the world transform their payments infrastructure and to expand our digital leadership, respectively. In 2016, we acquired the Convenience Pay Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and completed our purchase of the Community Financial Services business of ACI Worldwide, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $265 million. These acquisitions expand our biller solution offerings and enhance our suite of digital banking and payments solutions, and are included in the Payments segment.In May 2017, we sold our Australian item processing business, which was reported within the Financial segment, for approximately $17 million, and, in January 2018, we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of Monitise for proceeds of £37 million ($50 million). In addition, in February 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell a 55% interest of our lending solutions business, which is reported within the Financial segment, retaining a 45% interest in the joint venture.During 2017 and 2015, StoneRiver Group, L.P. (“StoneRiver”), a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses, and in 2016, recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest. Our pre-tax share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was $26 million in 2017, $146 million in 2016 and $29 million in 2015, with related tax expenses of $9 million, $54 million and $13 million, respectively. In addition, we received cash dividends of $45 million, $151 million and $36 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from StoneRiver, which were funded from the sale transactions.16Table of ContentsEnterprise PrioritiesWe continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2018 are: (i) to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and (iii) to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.Industry TrendsThe market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly. The traditional financial industry and other market entrants regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, lending, investment and risk management products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, regulatory conditions and cybersecurity scrutiny have continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. For example, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and may continue to generate, new regulations impacting the financial industry. These conditions, along with mild economic improvement, have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as “digital channels.”This increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. We expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. Based on these market conditions, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth. Furthermore, we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients.In addition to the trends described above, the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. An acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system, or elects to move to one of our systems, and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected. Financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts, which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi-year contract is acquired by another financial institution. These fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. Our revenue is diversified, and our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model, and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25% of our annual revenue. In addition, we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions 17Table of Contentsthat we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates.AcquisitionsFrom time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible AssetsWe review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry, and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test.The quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2017 determined that our goodwill was not impaired. The estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values, except for recently acquired reporting units that approximated or exceeded the carrying values to a lesser magnitude given the short passage of time between the recent acquisition dates and when we performed our most recent annual impairment assessment.We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionThe majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. At times, however, judgment is exercised in evaluating revenue recognition, such as when a contract arrangement includes multiple product and service deliverables. Due to the quantity, size and nature of our multiple element arrangements, the judgments we make in this regard are not likely to have a material impact on revenue recognition for any individual element. Additionally, given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.18Table of ContentsResults of OperationsComponents of Revenue and ExpensesThe following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue, which in 2017 represented 85% of our total revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses.ProductProduct revenue, which in 2017 represented 15% of our total revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales which represented less than 4% of our total revenue. Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses.19Table of ContentsFinancial ResultsThe following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year.

The increase in total revenue during 2017 and 2016 was attributable to revenue growth in our Payments segment of 5% and 8%, respectively, and revenue growth in our Financial segment of 2% and 1%, respectively, compared to the prior years. Revenue in our Payments segment increased $144 million, or 5%, in 2017 and increased $228 million, or 8%, in 2016 compared to the prior years. Revenue growth at our card services business contributed approximately 2.5% in each of 2017 and 2016 to the Payments segment revenue growth largely due to increased transaction volumes. Increased volumes also drove revenue growth contributions of 1% in 2017 from our electronic payments business and 2% in 2016 from our output solutions business, which included a higher level of EMV chip card manufacturing and personalization, compared to the prior years. Revenue from in-year business acquisitions further contributed $22 million, or 1%, and $86 million, or 3%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, to Payments segment revenue growth.Revenue in our Financial segment increased $53 million, or 2%, in 2017 and increased $34 million, or 1%, in 2016 compared to the prior years. Our lending solutions business contributed approximately 2% and 1% to the Financial segment revenue growth in 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by increased volumes. In addition, our account processing business contributed approximately 1% to the Financial segment revenue growth in 2016. Financial segment revenue growth was partially offset by the Australian item processing business disposition in 2017 and lower revenue in our international business in 2016, which each negatively impacted Financial segment revenue growth by approximately 1% compared to the prior years.21Table of ContentsTotal ExpensesTotal expenses increased $104 million in 2017 and $117 million in 2016, or 3% in each year, compared to the prior years. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 73.1%, 73.8% and 75.1% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total expenses were favorably impacted by 20 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the gain on the sale of our Australian item processing business. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was 47.4%, 47.8% and 49.4% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2017 and 2016 by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue in 2016 was also favorably impacted by approximately 80 basis points from lower amortization related to certain fully amortized acquisition-related intangible assets compared to the prior year.Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was consistent in 2017 and 2016 at 84.9%, and decreased from 86.7% in 2015. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was negatively impacted in 2015 by increased expenses in our output solutions business associated with additional investments to expand our card manufacturing and personalization capacity. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 20.2%, 20.0% and 19.7% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to increased costs associated with acquisitions.Operating Income and Operating MarginTotal operating income increased $87 million, or 6%, in 2017 and increased $134 million, or 10%, in 2016 compared to the prior years. Total operating margin increased to 26.9% in 2017 from 26.2% in 2016 and 24.9% in 2015. Operating income in our Payments segment increased $91 million, or 10%, in 2017 and increased $103 million, or 12%, in 2016 compared to the prior years. Operating margin was 32.0%, 30.5% and 29.3% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, increasing 150 basis points in 2017 and 120 basis points in 2016. Our card services business contributed approximately 110 basis points in each of 2017 and 2016 to the Payments segment operating margin growth largely attributable to scalable revenue growth. In addition, Payments segment operating margin was positively impacted by approximately 90 basis points from our electronic payments business in 2017 and by approximately 70 basis points from our output solutions business in 2016, attributable to improved operating leverage and product mix, respectively. Payments segment operating margin improvement was partially offset by approximately 50 basis points in each of 2017 and 2016 as a result of in-year acquisitions.Operating income in our Financial segment increased $26 million, or 3%, in 2017 and was generally consistent in 2016 compared to the prior years. Operating margin was 33.5%, 33.2% and 33.8% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, increasing 30 basis points in 2017 and decreasing 60 basis points in 2016. Financial segment operating margin in 2017 was positively impacted by approximately 70 basis points from scalable revenue growth. Increased expenses associated with incremental investments in innovation-based solutions negatively impacted Financial operating margin by 30 basis points and 60 basis points in 2017 and 2016, respectively.The operating loss in Corporate and Other increased $30 million in 2017 and decreased $34 million in 2016 compared to the prior years. The operating loss increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to increased acquisition and related integration costs of $12 million and increased employee benefit expenses, including severance, of $20 million. These increased costs were partially offset by a $10 million gain on the sale of our Australian item processing business. The operating loss improvement in 2016 was primarily due to lower amortization related to certain fully amortized acquisition-related intangible assets compared to 2015.Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased $13 million, or 8%, in 2017 and decreased $7 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared to the prior years. Higher average variable interest rates and higher average outstanding debt contributed approximately $7 million and $6 million, respectively, to increased interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016. The lower interest expense in 2016 was primarily due to the reclassification of $7 million to interest expense for unamortized losses on settled cash flow hedges related to the early extinguishment of debt in 2015.Interest and Investment Income (Loss), net The net interest and investment loss in 2016 was attributable to a non-cash write-off of a $7 million cost-method investment.22Table of ContentsLoss on Early Debt ExtinguishmentIn May 2015, we redeemed our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in 2016 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.8% senior notes due in 2017, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $85 million related to make-whole payments and other costs associated with redemption.Income Tax ProvisionIncome tax provision as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate was 11.6%, 38.6% and 35.7% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The rate in 2017 decreased by 20.3% attributable to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as further described below, and by 3.6% attributable to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards recognized as a reduction in the income tax provision as a result of the 2017 adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The higher rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the level of income tax expense associated with our share of the net gains on sales transactions by our unconsolidated affiliate, StoneRiver.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Act makes broad changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning in 2018; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) requiring U.S. federal taxable income to include certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; and (5) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense. The provisions of the Tax Act decreased our 2017 effective tax rate by 20.3%, primarily due to the re-evaluation of the net deferred tax liability to reflect the lower federal tax rate of 21 percent. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from the reported amounts due to changes in interpretations and assumptions, as well as guidance that may be issued in the future.Income from Investment in Unconsolidated AffiliateDuring 2017 and 2015, StoneRiver recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses, and in 2016, recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest, resulting in our share of StoneRiver income of $32 million, $147 million and $32 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Income from Discontinued OperationsIncome from discontinued operations in 2017 included a litigation settlement related to a prior disposition of $19 million, net of income tax of $7 million, and earnings related to an acquired business held for sale.Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing OperationsNet income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $5.71, $4.15 and $2.99 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted by discrete income tax benefits associated with the Tax Act of $1.28 per share in 2017 and from our share of net investment gains, primarily from StoneRiver capital transactions, of $0.09, $0.39 and $0.07 per share in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted in 2017 and 2016 by merger and integration costs of $0.23 and $0.17 per share, respectively, and in 2015 by debt extinguishment and refinancing costs of $0.25 per share. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.49, $0.46 and $0.53 per share in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.23Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralOur primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $325 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $0.9 billion at December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

This increase was primarily due to improved operating results, partially offset by $106 million of lower cash dividends received from our StoneRiver joint venture and unfavorable timing of payables. In 2017 and 2016, we received cash dividends of $45 million and $151 million, respectively, from our StoneRiver joint venture. These dividends, in their entirety, represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions, and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 5% of our total revenue in both 2017 and 2016. Share RepurchasesWe purchased $1.17 billion and $1.20 billion of our common stock in 2017 and 2016, respectively. On November 16, 2016, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 10.7 million shares remaining under this authorization. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans.Acquisitions and DispositionsWe completed four acquisitions in 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $384 million, net of $33 million of acquired cash, and two acquisitions in 2016 for an aggregate purchase price of $265 million. We funded these acquisitions by utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility.In January 2018, we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of Monitise for proceeds of £37 million ($50 million). In addition, in February 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell a 55% interest of our lending solutions business, retaining a 45% interest in the joint venture.24Table of ContentsIndebtedness December 31,(In millions)2017 2016Revolving credit facility$1,068 $647Term loan540 6292.7% senior notes due 2020846 8454.625% senior notes due 2020449 4484.75% senior notes due 2021398 3983.5% senior notes due 2022696 6953.85% senior notes due 2025894 893Other borrowings9 7Total debt (including current maturities)$4,900 $4,562At December 31, 2017, our debt consisted primarily of $3.3 billion of senior notes, $1.1 billion of revolving credit facility borrowings and $540 million of term loan borrowings. Interest on our senior notes is paid semi-annually. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2017. Additional information about our debt structure and associated instruments is included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.Variable Rate DebtWe maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement and a term loan with a syndicate of banks. Both the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate was 2.59% on the revolving credit facility borrowings and 2.82% on the term loan borrowings at December 31, 2017. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements on the revolving credit facility, which matures in April 2020. The outstanding principal balance on the term loan of $540 million is due at maturity in October 2018. At December 31, 2017, the term loan was classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility and the term loan contain various, substantially similar restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to: (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended.OtherAccess to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities.The interest rates payable on our senior notes, revolving credit facility and term loan are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.25Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency. Our senior management actively monitors these risks.We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt. Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at December 31, 2017, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2018 by approximately $16 million.In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested into short-term, highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. Subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity. During 2017, the subscriber funds daily average balance approximated $1.2 billion. A 1% increase or decrease in applicable interest rates would not have a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations.We conduct business in the United States and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately $150 million as of December 31, 2017 to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. In 2017, approximately 5% of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2017, there would not have been a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position.26Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:20:17.744691

This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2018.22Table of ContentsOverviewCompany BackgroundWe are a leading global provider of financial services technology. We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve over 12,000 clients worldwide, including banks, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, billers, retailers, and merchants. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature.Our operations are principally located in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment and the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, account-to-account transfers, person-to-person payment services, debit and credit card processing and services, payments infrastructure services, and other electronic payments software and services. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides financial institutions with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Corporate and Other primarily consists of intercompany eliminations, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, unallocated corporate expenses and other activities that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance, such as gains on sales of businesses and associated transition services.On February 21, 2018, our board of directors declared a two-for-one stock split of our common stock and a proportionate increase in the number of our authorized shares of common stock. The additional shares were distributed on March 19, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 5, 2018. Our common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on March 20, 2018. All share and per share amounts are retroactively presented on a split-adjusted basis.Acquisitions and DispositionsWe frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of businesses to execute on our strategy. We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; an opportunity to change industry dynamics; a way to achieve business scale; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies.On January 16, 2019, we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire First Data in an all-stock transaction for an equity value of approximately $22 billion as of the announcement. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and shareholder approval for both companies. First Data is a global leader in commerce-enabling technology and solutions for merchants, financial institutions, and card issuers. On October 31, 2018, we acquired the debit card processing, ATM Managed Services, and Money Pass® surcharge-free network of Elan Financial Services, a unit of U.S. Bancorp, for approximately $660 million including estimated post-closing working capital adjustments, contingent consideration related to earn-out provisions and future payments under a transition services agreement in excess of fair value. This acquisition, included within the Payments segment, deepens our presence in debit card processing, broadens our client reach and scale, and provides new solutions to enhance the value proposition for our existing debit solution clients.During 2017, we completed four acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $384 million, net of acquired cash, along with earn-out provisions. In January 2017, we completed our acquisition of Online Banking Solutions, Inc. (“OBS”), a provider of cash management and digital business banking solutions that complement and enrich our existing solutions. In July 2017, we acquired the assets of PCLender, LLC (“PCLender”), a leader in internet-based mortgage software and mortgage lending technology solutions. The OBS and PCLender acquisitions are included in the Financial segment as their products are integrated across a number of our account processing solutions and will enable our bank and credit union clients to better serve their commercial and mortgage customers. In August 2017, we acquired Dovetail Group Limited (“Dovetail”), a leading provider of bank payments and liquidity management solutions. In September 2017, we completed our acquisition of Monitise plc (“Monitise”), a provider of digital solutions that enables innovative digital banking experiences for leading financial institutions worldwide. The Dovetail and Monitise acquisitions are included in the Payments segment and are expected to further enable us to help financial institutions around the world transform their payments infrastructure and to expand our digital leadership, respectively. 23Table of ContentsIn 2016, we acquired the Convenience Pay Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and completed our purchase of the Community Financial Services business of ACI Worldwide, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $265 million. These acquisitions expand our biller solution offerings and enhance our suite of digital banking and payments solutions, and are included in the Payments segment.In March 2018, we sold a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business, which was reported within the Financial segment, retaining 45% ownership interests in two joint ventures (the “Lending Joint Ventures”). In conjunction with this transaction, we entered into transition services agreements to provide, at fair value, various administration, business process outsourcing, technical and data center related services for defined periods to the Lending Joint Ventures. We received gross sale proceeds of $419 million from the transactions. In addition, in January 2018, we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of Monitise for proceeds of £37 million ($50 million), and in May 2017, we sold our Australian item processing business, which was reported within the Financial segment, for approximately $17 million.During 2017, StoneRiver Group, L.P. (“StoneRiver”), a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, recognized a net gain on the sale of a business, and in 2016, recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest. Our pre-tax share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was $26 million in 2017 and $146 million in 2016, with related tax expenses of $9 million and $54 million, respectively. In addition, we received cash dividends of $2 million, $45 million and $151 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, from StoneRiver, which were funded from the sale transactions.Enterprise PrioritiesWe continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to move money and information in a way that moves the world. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2019 are to: (i) continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and (iii) deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. We also expect to devote significant resources to completing the First Data merger and, subject to closing, to integrating First Data into our operations.Industry TrendsThe market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly. The traditional financial industry and other market entrants regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, risk management, lending, and investment products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, the evolving regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. For example, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and may continue to generate, new regulations impacting the financial industry. These conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include electronic payments and delivery methods such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as “digital channels.”The focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. We expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us.In addition to the trends described above, the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. If a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition, we receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. These fees can vary from period to period. Our revenue is diversified, and we have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model, with our 50 largest financial institution clients 24Table of Contentsrepresenting less than 25% of our annual revenue. Our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. Furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates.AcquisitionsFrom time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible AssetsWe review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry, and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test.The quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2018 determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values.We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.25Table of ContentsRevenue RecognitionWe generate revenue from the delivery of processing, service and product solutions. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer which may be at a point in time or over time. As a practical expedient, we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. Contracts with customers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue is generated from account- and transaction-based fees for data processing, transaction processing, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds transfer and debit processing services; consulting and professional services; and software maintenance for ongoing client support.We recognize processing and services revenues in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services in which revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services. Our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when and if needed basis (a stand-ready obligation) and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer. These services are typically provided under a fixed or declining (tier-based) price per unit based on volume of service; however, pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees. Fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis.ProductProduct revenue is generated from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales. For software license agreements that are distinct, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery, assuming a contract is deemed to exist. Revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization, modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended, such as labor hours, to measure progress towards completion. For arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer, a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software.Significant JudgmentsWe use the following methods, inputs, and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize. For multi-element arrangements, we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement, and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.Technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings. Whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers.The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. We include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price. To the extent that variable consideration is not constrained, we include an estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract. We may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted. The transaction price (including any discounts) is allocated between separate goods and services in a multi-element arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines. Significant judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service.26Table of ContentsContract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price (or both) of the contract or when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by us. When a contract modification occurs, it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as:(i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract. Further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract, including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation.Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included within Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.Results of OperationsComponents of Revenue and ExpensesThe following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue, which in 2018 represented 85% of our total revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses.ProductProduct revenue, which in 2018 represented 15% of our total revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales. Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses.27Table of ContentsFinancial ResultsThe following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year.

Revenue in our Payments segment increased $233 million, or 7%, in 2018 and increased $144 million, or 5%, in 2017 compared to the prior years. Revenue from acquired businesses contributed 2% and 1% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, to Payments segment revenue growth. Revenue growth at our card services business contributed approximately 2% and 2.5% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, to the Payments segment revenue growth largely due to increased transaction volumes. Increased volumes also drove revenue growth contributions of 1% in both 2018 and 2017 from our electronic payments business and 1% in 2018 from our biller solutions business. Revenue in our Financial segment decreased $135 million, or 5%, in 2018 and increased $53 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared to the prior years. Dispositions, including the Lending Solutions business, reduced Financial segment revenue growth by 9% in 2018 and 1% in 2017 compared to the prior years. Partially offsetting the decline in 2018, our account processing businesses contributed 2.5% of revenue growth to the Financial segment. Our lending solutions business contributed approximately 2% to the Financial segment revenue growth in 2017, driven by increased volumes.Revenue at Corporate and Other increased $29 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to transition services revenue from the Lending Joint Ventures. Revenue at Corporate and Other was relatively consistent in 2017 and 2016.29Table of ContentsTotal ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $94 million, or 2%, in 2018 and increased $104 million, or 3%, in 2017 compared to the prior years. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 69.9%, 73.1% and 73.8% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total expenses and total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were reduced by the $227 million gain on sale of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business in 2018 and by the $10 million gain on sale of our Australian item processing business in 2017.Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was 46.7%, 47.4% and 47.8% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted by operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses in both 2018 and 2017. In 2018, this included improvements of approximately 80 basis points from scalable revenue growth in our Payments segment, and approximately 60 basis points from our account processing businesses driven by product mix and expense management. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue improvement in 2018 was partially offset by approximately 50 basis points from client-focused incremental investments.Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 87.9% in 2018 and was consistent at 84.9% in 2017 and 2016. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2018 was largely impacted by additional expenses associated with product development, as well as by approximately 130 basis points due to a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 21.1%, 20.2% and 20.0% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The disposition of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business negatively impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2018 by approximately 50 basis points. Increased costs associated with acquisitions negatively impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue by approximately 30 basis points in 2018 and 40 basis points in 2017 compared to the prior years.The gain on sale of businesses of $227 million in 2018 and $10 million in 2017 resulted from the sales of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business and our Australian item processing business, respectively.Operating Income and Operating MarginTotal operating income increased $221 million, or 14%, in 2018 and increased $87 million, or 6%, in 2017 compared to the prior years. Total operating margin increased to 30.1% in 2018 from 26.9% in 2017 and 26.2% in 2016. Operating income in our Payments segment increased $88 million, or 9%, in 2018 and increased $91 million, or 10%, in 2017 compared to the prior years. Operating margin was 32.3%, 32.0% and 30.5% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, increasing 30 basis points in 2018 and 150 basis points in 2017. Scalable revenue growth positively impacted Payments segment operating margin by approximately 120 basis points and 200 basis points in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Payments segment operating margin improvement was partially offset by 30 basis points in 2018 and 50 basis points in 2017 as a result of acquisitions, and by approximately 50 basis points in 2018 from client-focused incremental investments.Operating income in our Financial segment decreased $51 million, or 6%, in 2018 and increased $26 million, or 3%, in 2017 compared to the prior years. Operating margin was 33.3%, 33.5% and 33.2% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, decreasing 20 basis points in 2018 and increasing 30 basis points in 2017. Financial segment operating margin in 2018 was reduced by approximately 130 basis points due to the disposition of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business and 20 basis points from client-focused incremental investments, partially offset by contributions of approximately 130 basis points from our account processing businesses related to product mix and expense management. Financial segment operating margin in 2017 was positively impacted by approximately 70 basis points from scalable revenue growth, partially offset by 30 basis points from increased expenses associated with incremental investments in innovation-based solutions.The operating loss in Corporate and Other decreased $184 million in 2018 and increased $30 million in 2017 compared to the prior years. Corporate and Other was favorably impacted by gains of $227 million and $10 million from the sales of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business in 2018 and our Australian item processing business in 2017, respectively. The operating loss in Corporate and Other in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily impacted by increased professional services expenses for data center consolidation and acquisition integration activities. The operating loss increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to increased acquisition and related integration costs of $12 million and increased employee benefit expenses, including severance, of $20 million.30Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseInterest expense increased $17 million, or 10%, in 2018 and increased $13 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared to the prior years. The interest expense increase in 2018 was primarily attributable to the issuance of $2.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes. Higher average variable interest rates and higher average outstanding debt contributed approximately $7 million and $6 million, respectively, to increased interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016. Loss on Early Debt ExtinguishmentIn 2018, we completed a cash tender offer for and redemption of our $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due October 2020, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $14 million.Non-Operating Income (Loss)Non-operating income in 2018 includes $4 million of interest income and $5 million related to the fulfillment of our stand-ready obligations to perform over the term of the Lending Joint Ventures debt guarantees and the associated release from risk. Non-operating income of $2 million in 2017 was primarily attributable to an unrealized gain on a foreign currency hedge related to our Monitise acquisition. The non-operating loss in 2016 was attributable to a non-cash write-off of a $7 million cost-method investment.Income Tax ProvisionIncome tax provision as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was 24.3%, 11.6% and 38.6% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The rate in 2018 was impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), as further described below, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The rate in 2017 decreased by 20.3% attributable to the Tax Act, and by 3.6% attributable to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards recognized as a reduction in the income tax provision as a result of the 2017 adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Act made broad changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning in 2018; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) requiring U.S. federal taxable income to include certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; and (5) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense. The provisions of the Tax Act decreased our 2017 effective tax rate by 20.3%, primarily due to the re-evaluation of the net deferred tax liability to reflect the lower federal tax rate of 21 percent. Income from Investments in Unconsolidated AffiliatesOur share of net income from the Lending Joint Ventures and StoneRiver is reported as income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates and the related tax expense is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates of $10 million in 2018 was primarily comprised of our share of earnings from the Lending Joint Ventures. During 2017, StoneRiver recognized a net gain on the sale of a business, and in 2016, recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest, resulting in our share of StoneRiver income of $32 million and $147 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.Income from Discontinued OperationsIncome from discontinued operations in 2017 included a litigation settlement related to a prior disposition of $19 million, net of income tax of $7 million, and earnings related to an acquired business held for sale.Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing OperationsNet income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $2.87, $2.86 and $2.08 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2018 was favorably impacted by a gain of $0.37 per share on the sale of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted by discrete income tax benefits associated with the Tax Act of $0.64 per share in 2017 and from our share of net investment gains, primarily from StoneRiver capital transactions, of $0.05 and $0.20 per share in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted in 2018, 2017 and 2016 by merger and integration costs of $0.17, $0.11 and $0.08 per share, respectively. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also 31Table of Contentsreduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.31, $0.25 and $0.23 per share in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralOur primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $415 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $850 million at December 31, 2018. See below under “First Data Acquisition Financing” for a description of our planned financing to fund the First Data acquisition. The following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

This increase was primarily due to improved operating results, partially offset by an approximate $30 million impact of accounts receivable timing, other working capital fluctuations including a $23 million tax payment resulting from new guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service regarding the Tax Act, and $43 million of lower cash dividends received from StoneRiver. The dividends received in 2018 and 2017 represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, for share repurchases (after the closing of the First Data acquisition), and acquisitions, and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 6% and 5% of our total revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Share RepurchasesWe purchased $1.91 billion and $1.17 billion of our common stock in 2018 and 2017, respectively. On each of November 16, 2016 and August 8, 2018, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 30.0 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 26.0 million shares remaining under these authorizations. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. We deferred share repurchases as of January 16, 2019 until the close of the First Data acquisition, as described below, which is expected to occur during the second half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and shareholder approval for both companies.Acquisitions and Dispositions On January 16, 2019, we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire First Data in an all-stock transaction for an equity value of approximately $22 billion as of the announcement. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and shareholder approval for both 32Table of Contentscompanies. First Data is a global leader in commerce-enabling technology and solutions for merchants, financial institutions, and card issuers.On October 31, 2018, we acquired the debit card processing, ATM Managed Services, and Money Pass® surcharge-free network of Elan Financial Services, a unit of U.S. Bancorp, for approximately $660 million including estimated post-closing working capital adjustments, contingent consideration related to earn-out provisions and future payments under a transition services agreement in excess of fair value. We funded this acquisition by utilizing existing availability under our revolving credit facility.We completed four acquisitions in 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $384 million, net of acquired cash, and two acquisitions in 2016 for an aggregate purchase price of $265 million. We funded these acquisitions by utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility.During 2018, we sold a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business, retaining 45% ownership interests in two joint ventures. We received gross sale proceeds of $419 million from the transactions. In addition, we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of Monitise for proceeds of £37 million ($50 million). In 2017, we sold our Australian item processing business for approximately $17 million.

Interest on our senior notes is paid semi-annually. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2018. Additional information about our debt structure and associated instruments is included in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.Revolving Credit FacilityIn September 2018, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement that restated our existing $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and extended its maturity from April 2020 to September 2023. Borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility continue to bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus in each case a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The amended and restated revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to (1) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times our consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and expenses and certain other adjustments (“EBITDA”) during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions, and (2) maintain EBITDA of at least three times our consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended. On February 6, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the amended and restated revolving credit facility to (1) amend the maximum leverage ratio covenant to permit us to elect to increase the permitted maximum leverage ratio from three and one-half times our EBITDA to either four times or four and one-half times our EBITDA for a specified period following certain acquisitions and (2) permit us to make drawings under the revolving credit facility on the closing date of our acquisition of First Data subject to only limited conditions.33Table of ContentsOn February 15, 2019, we entered into a second amendment to our existing revolving credit agreement in order to increase the aggregate commitments available thereunder by $1.5 billion and to make certain additional amendments to facilitate the operation of the combined business following the merger. The increased commitments and additional amendments will become effective upon the satisfaction or waiver of conditions that are substantially similar to the conditions to funding under the term loan facility described under “First Data Acquisition Financing” below.Senior NotesIn September 2018, we completed an offering of $2.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.8% senior notes due in October 2023 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.2% senior notes due in October 2028. The notes pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, commencing on April 1, 2019. The interest rate applicable to these notes is subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that the credit rating assigned to such notes is downgraded below investment grade. The indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (1) our ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (2) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (3) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions.We used the net proceeds from the offering described above to repay the outstanding principal balance of $540 million under our term loan and the outstanding borrowings under our amended and restated revolving credit facility totaling $1.1 billion. In addition, we commenced a cash tender offer in September 2018 for any and all of our outstanding $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due October 2020. Upon expiration of the tender offer on September 26, 2018, $246 million was tendered and $253 million was paid to all holders of such tendered notes in October 2018. In October 2018, we also retired the remaining outstanding $204 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes.Debt GuaranteesIn connection with the sale of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business in March 2018, we have guaranteed underlying debt of the Lending Joint Ventures and do not anticipate that the Lending Joint Ventures will fail to fulfill their debt obligations. This debt is comprised of variable-rate term loan facilities for an aggregate amount of $350 million in senior unsecured debt and variable-rate revolving credit facilities for an aggregate amount of $35 million with a syndicate of banks. These debt facilities mature in March 2023, and there are no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2018. We have not made any payments under the guarantees, nor have we been called upon to do so.First Data Acquisition FinancingIn connection with the definitive merger agreement to acquire First Data, on January 16, 2019, we entered into a bridge facility commitment letter pursuant to which a group of financial institutions committed to provide a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $17 billion for the purpose of refinancing certain indebtedness of First Data and its subsidiaries on the closing date of the merger, making cash payments in lieu of fractional shares as part of the merger consideration, and paying fees and expenses related to the merger, the refinancing and the related transactions.On February 15, 2019, we entered into a new term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions pursuant to which such financial institutions have committed to provide us with a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion, consisting of $1.5 billion in commitments to provide loans with a three-year maturity and $3.5 billion in commitments to provide loans with a five-year maturity. The aggregate principal amount of the commitments under the term loan credit agreement have replaced a corresponding amount of the commitments in respect of the bridge facility in accordance with the terms of the bridge facility commitment letter. As a result, there are now $12.0 billion in bridge facility commitments remaining. We expect to replace these remaining commitments with permanent financing in the form of the issuance of debt securities prior to the closing of the merger.The availability of loans under the term loan facility is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions that are substantially consistent with the conditions to the funding of the bridge facility, including (i) the closing of the merger substantially concurrently with the funding of such loans, (ii) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to First Data since January 16, 2019, (iii) the truth and accuracy in all material respects of certain representations and warranties, (iv) the receipt of certain certificates, and (v) the receipt of certain financial statements. Loans drawn under the term loan facility will be subject to amortization at an annual rate of 5% for the first two years and 7.5% thereafter (with loans outstanding under the five-year tranche subject to amortization at an annual rate of 10% after the fourth anniversary of the commencement of amortization), with accrued and unpaid amortization amounts required to be paid on the last business day in December of each year. Borrowings under the term loan facility will bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR or on a base rate plus, in each case, a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. We are also required to pay a ticking fee that will accrue on the aggregate undrawn commitments under the term loan facility at a per annum rate based upon our long-34Table of Contentsterm debt rating in effect from time to time. The term loan credit agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default, that are substantially the same as those set forth in our existing revolving credit facility, as amended as described above.OtherAccess to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. Such credit ratings were both affirmed in connection with our definitive merger agreement to acquire First Data.The interest rates payable on our senior notes and revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates on the senior notes are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing. The following table details our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018:(In millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsLong-term debt including interest (1) (2) $7,131 $224 $1,646 $3,127 $2,134Minimum operating lease payments (1) 430 94 137 91 108Purchase obligations (1) 500 239 127 11 123Income tax obligations 49 3 38 8 —Total $8,110 $560 $1,948 $3,237 $2,365(1)Interest, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis.(2)The calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, no additional refinancing or lending occurs, and the variable rate on the revolving credit facility is priced at the rate in effect as of December 31, 2018.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency. Our senior management actively monitors these risks.We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt. Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at December 31, 2018, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2019 by approximately $11 million.In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested into short-term, highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. Subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity. During 2018, the subscriber funds daily average balance approximated $1.3 billion. A 1% increase or decrease in applicable interest rates would not have a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations.We conduct business in the United States and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately 35Table of Contents$202 million as of December 31, 2018 to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. In 2018, approximately 6% of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2018, there would not have been a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position.",2023-12-30 20:20:22.408498

We provide account processing systems; electronic payments processing products and services; internet and mobile banking systems; merchant transaction processing and acquiring, including the Clover® line of payment solutions and related applications; prepaid and payroll services; and check verification. We serve clients around the globe, including banks, credit unions, other financial institutions and merchants.Our operations are comprised of the First Data segment, the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment and the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment. On July 29, 2019, we completed the acquisition of First Data Corporation (“First Data”), a global leader in commerce-enabling technology and solutions for merchants, financial institutions and card issuers. The First Data segment primarily provides merchant acquiring, e-commerce, mobile commerce, and other business solutions at the point-of-sale (“POS”) to businesses of all sizes and types; credit card and loan account processing, commercial payments, customer communications, plastics products and services, customer service, and other products to support issuers; and a range of network solutions and security, risk and fraud management products and services to business and financial institution clients, including U.S. debit card processing, our STAR® network, stored value commerce solutions (both closed-loop and open-loop), and our suite of security and fraud products and services. The businesses in the First Data segment are subject to a modest level of seasonality, with the first quarter experiencing the lowest level of revenue and the fourth quarter experiencing the highest level of revenue.The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, account-to-account transfers, person-to-person payment services, debit and credit card processing and services, payments infrastructure services, and other electronic payments software and services. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment primarily provides financial institutions with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Our Payments and Financial segment operations are principally located in the U.S. The majority of our revenue within these segments is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts with high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide within our segments are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature.Corporate and Other primarily consists of intercompany eliminations, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, unallocated corporate expenses of the combined company and other activities that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance, such as gains on sales of businesses and associated transition services. We expect to realign our business segments in the first quarter of 2020 when our new reporting structure and First Data integration plans are finalized.On February 21, 2018, our board of directors declared a two-for-one stock split of our common stock and a proportionate increase in the number of our authorized shares of common stock. The additional shares were distributed on March 19, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 5, 2018. Our common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on March 20, 2018. All share and per share amounts are retroactively presented on a split-adjusted basis.Acquisitions and DispositionsWe frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of businesses to execute on our strategy. We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; an opportunity to change industry dynamics; a way to achieve business scale; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies.AcquisitionsOn July 29, 2019, we completed the acquisition of First Data Corporation for a total purchase price of $46.5 billion by acquiring 100% of the First Data stock that was issued and outstanding as of the date of acquisition. As a result of the 27Table of Contentsacquisition, First Data stockholders received 286 million shares of common stock of Fiserv, Inc., at an exchange ratio of 0.303 shares of Fiserv, Inc. for each share of First Data common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. We also converted 15 million outstanding First Data equity awards into corresponding equity awards relating to common stock of Fiserv, Inc. in accordance with the exchange ratio. In addition, concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, we made a cash payment of $16.4 billion to repay existing First Data debt. We funded the transaction-related expenses and the repayment of First Data debt through a combination of available cash on-hand, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings. The acquisition of First Data increases our footprint as a global payments and financial technology provider by expanding the portfolio of services provided to financial institutions, corporate and merchant clients and consumers.In October 2018, we acquired the debit card processing, ATM Managed Services, and MoneyPass® surcharge-free network of Elan Financial Services, a unit of U.S. Bancorp, for approximately $659 million including post-closing working capital adjustments, estimated contingent consideration related to earn-out provisions and future payments under a transition services agreement in excess of estimated fair value. This acquisition, included within the Payments segment, deepens our presence in debit card processing, broadens our client reach and scale and provides new solutions to enhance the value proposition for our existing debit solution clients.During 2017, we completed four acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $384 million, net of acquired cash, along with earn-out provisions. In January 2017, we completed our acquisition of Online Banking Solutions, Inc. (“OBS”), a provider of cash management and digital business banking solutions that complement and enrich our existing solutions. In July 2017, we acquired the assets of PCLender, LLC (“PCLender”), a leader in internet-based mortgage software and mortgage lending technology solutions. The OBS and PCLender acquisitions are included in the Financial segment as their products are integrated across a number of our account processing solutions and enable our bank and credit union clients to better serve their commercial and mortgage customers. In August 2017, we acquired Dovetail Group Limited (“Dovetail”), a leading provider of bank payments and liquidity management solutions. In September 2017, we completed our acquisition of Monitise plc (“Monitise”), a provider of digital solutions that enables innovative digital banking experiences for leading financial institutions worldwide. The Dovetail and Monitise acquisitions are included in the Payments segment and further enable us to help financial institutions around the world transform their payments infrastructure and to expand our digital leadership, respectively. DispositionsOn December 4, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a 60% controlling interest of our Investment Services business, which is reported within the Payments segment. On February 18, 2020, we completed the sale of the 60% interest of this business to a group of investors for gross proceeds of $591 million, resulting in an estimated pre-tax gain, including the remeasurement of the Company’s retained interest, of approximately $430 million. Our 40% retained interest will be accounted for as an equity method investment.In connection with the acquisition of First Data, we acquired two businesses which we intended to sell. In October 2019, we completed the sales, at acquired fair value, of these two businesses for aggregate proceeds of $133 million. In March 2018, we sold a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business, which was reported within the Financial segment, retaining 45% ownership interests in two joint ventures (the “Lending Joint Ventures”). In conjunction with this transaction, we entered into transition services agreements to provide, at fair value, various administration, business process outsourcing and data center related services for defined periods to the Lending Joint Ventures. We received gross sale proceeds of $419 million from the transactions. In August 2019, the Sagent Auto, LLC joint venture, formerly known as Fiserv Automotive Solutions, LLC, completed a merger with a third-party, resulting in the dilution of our ownership interest to 31% in the new combined entity, defi SOLUTIONS Group, LLC (“defi SOLUTIONS”). In addition, in January 2018, we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of Monitise for proceeds of £37 million ($50 million), and in May 2017, we sold our Australian item processing business, which was reported within the Financial segment, for approximately $17 million.During 2017, StoneRiver Group, L.P. (“StoneRiver”), a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, recognized a gain on the sale of a business. Our pre-tax share of the gain was $26 million, with related tax expense of $9 million. In addition, we received cash distributions of $2 million and $45 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, from StoneRiver, which were funded from sale transactions.Enterprise PrioritiesWe continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to move money and information in a way that moves the world. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our 28Table of Contentsproducts and services through innovation. During 2019, our key enterprise priorities were to (i) deliver integration value from the First Data acquisition; (ii) continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (iii) enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and (iv) deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.Industry TrendsThe global payments landscape continues to evolve, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, e-commerce and innovation in real-time payments infrastructure. Because of this growth, competition also continues to evolve. Business and consumer expectations continue to rise, with a focus on convenience and security. To meet these expectations, payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology, utilizing data and enhancing the customer experience.Financial InstitutionsThe market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly. The traditional financial industry and other market entrants regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, risk management, lending and investment products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. These conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include electronic payments and delivery methods such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as “digital channels.”The focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. We expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. In addition to the trends described above, the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. If a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition, we receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. These fees can vary from period to period. Our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. Furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth.MerchantsThe rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and e-commerce, driven by consumers’ desire for simpler, more efficient shopping experiences, has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers in high-growth online and mobile settings, which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments. Merchants are demanding simpler, integrated and modern POS systems to help manage their everyday business operations. When combined with the ever-increasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services, merchants have sought modern POS systems to streamline this complexity. Furthermore, merchants can now search, discover, compare, purchase and even install a new POS system through direct, digital-only experiences. This direct, digital-only channel is quickly becoming a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities, especially with respect to smaller merchants. Additionally, there are numerous software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions in the industry, many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring within their software in a way to further monetize their client relationships. SaaS solutions that 29Table of Contentsintegrate payments are often referred to as Independent Software Vendors, or ISVs, and we believe there are thousands of these potential distribution partnership opportunities available to us.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates.AcquisitionsFrom time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. The determination of fair value requires estimates about discount rates, growth and retention rates, royalty rates, expected future cash flows and other future events that are judgmental in nature. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible AssetsWe review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry, and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test.The quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2019 determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values except for the reporting units related to the acquisition of First Data. An assessment of qualitative factors, including the proximity of the acquisition date to the year end reporting period, did not identify indicators of impairment in relation to the First Data goodwill. Goodwill recorded as a result of our acquisition of First Data is based on preliminary estimates and assumptions using information available at the reporting date, and therefore the potential for measurement period adjustments exists based on our continuing review of matters related to the acquisition. We have no accumulated goodwill impairment through December 31, 2019. See Note 8 for additional information.We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on 30Table of Contentsestimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionWe generate revenue from the delivery of processing, service and product solutions. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer which may be at a point in time or over time. As a practical expedient, we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. Contracts with customers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue is generated from account- and transaction-based fees for data processing, transaction processing, merchant acquiring and e-commerce, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds transfer and debit processing services; consulting and professional services; and software maintenance for ongoing client support.We recognize processing and services revenues in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services in which revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services. Our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when and if needed basis (a stand-ready obligation) and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer. These services are typically provided under a fixed or declining (tier-based) price per unit based on volume of service; however, pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees. Fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis.ProductProduct revenue is generated from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales. For software license agreements that are distinct, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery, assuming a contract is deemed to exist. Revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization, modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended, such as labor hours, to measure progress towards completion. For arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer, a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software.We also sell or lease hardware (POS devices) and other peripherals as part of our contracts with customers. Hardware typically consists of terminals or Clover® devices. We do not manufacture hardware, rather we purchase hardware from third-party vendors and hold such hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer. We account for sales of hardware as a separate performance obligation and recognize the revenue at its standalone selling price when the customer obtains control of the hardware.Significant JudgmentsWe use the following methods, inputs, and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize. For multi-element arrangements, we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement, and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.Technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings. Whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers.The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. We include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price. To the extent that variable consideration is not constrained, we include an estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within 31Table of Contentsthe total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract. We may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted. The transaction price (including any discounts) is allocated between distinct goods and services in a multi-element arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines. Significant judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service.Contract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price (or both) of the contract or when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by us. When a contract modification occurs, it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as (i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract. Further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract, including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation.Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included within Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires management’s judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, including our increased global footprint. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish a liability for known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions, and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. In establishing a liability for known tax exposures, assumptions are made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position will be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized reflects the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our liability for known tax exposures as appropriate.We, primarily through our First Data acquisition, maintain net operating loss carryforwards in various taxing jurisdictions, resulting in the establishment of deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, based upon the weight of all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We believe that a significant portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized because of the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the tax law; however, we have established valuation allowances for those deferred tax assets that in our judgment will not be realized. In making this determination, we have considered the relative impact of all of the available positive and negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income and available tax planning strategies. However, there could be a material impact to our effective tax rate if there is a significant change in our judgment. To the extent our judgment changes, the valuation allowances are then adjusted, generally through the provision for income taxes, in the period in which this determination is made.Results of OperationsComponents of Revenue and ExpensesThe following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue, which in 2019 represented 84% of our total revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; certain depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses.32Table of ContentsProductProduct revenue, which in 2019 represented 16% of our total revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales and hardware (POS devices) sales. Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses.33Table of ContentsFinancial ResultsThe following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year-to-year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The financial results presented below have been affected by the First Data and other acquisitions, dispositions, transactional gains recorded by our unconsolidated affiliates, debt financing activities, foreign currency fluctuations, and by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. In addition, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and its related amendments using the modified retrospective transition approach applied to all contracts. Under this transition approach, prior period amounts have not been restated.(In millions) Percentage of Revenue (1) Increase (Decrease)Year ended December 31,2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017Revenue: Processing and services$8,573 $4,975 $4,833 84.2 % 85.4 % 84.8 % $3,598 72 % $142 3 %Product1,614 848 863 15.8 % 14.6 % 15.2 % 766 90 % (15) (2)%Total revenue10,187 5,823 5,696 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 4,364 75 % 127 2 %Expenses: Cost of processing and services4,016 2,324 2,291 46.8 % 46.7 % 47.4 % 1,692 73 % 33 1 %Cost of product1,293 745 733 80.1 % 87.9 % 84.9 % 548 74 % 12 2 %Sub-total5,309 3,069 3,024 52.1 % 52.7 % 53.1 % 2,240 73 % 45 1 %Selling, general and administrative3,284 1,228 1,150 32.2 % 21.1 % 20.2 % 2,056 167 % 78 7 %Gain on sale of businesses(15) (227) (10) (0.1)% (3.9)% (0.2)% (212) n/m 217 n/mTotal expenses8,578 4,070 4,164 84.2 % 69.9 % 73.1 % 4,508 111 % (94) (2)%Operating income1,609 1,753 1,532 15.8 % 30.1 % 26.9 % (144) (8)% 221 14 %Interest expense, net(473) (189) (175) (4.6)% (3.2)% (3.1)% 284 150 % 14 8 %Debt financing activities(47) (14) — (0.5)% (0.2)% — % 33 236 % 14 n/mOther (expense) income(6) 5 1 (0.1)% 0.1 % — % (11) n/m 4 n/mIncome from continuing operations before income taxes and income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates1,083 1,555 1,358 10.6 % 26.7 % 23.8 % (472) (30)% 197 15 %Income tax provision(198) (378) (158) (1.9)% (6.5)% (2.8)% (180) (48)% 220 139 %Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates29 10 32 0.3 % 0.2 % 0.6 % 19 190 % (22) (69)%Income from continuing operations914 1,187 1,232 9.0 % 20.4 % 21.6 % $(273) (23)% $(45) (4)%Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes— — 14 — % — % 0.2 % — — % (14) n/mNet income914 1,187 1,246 9.0 % 20.4 % 21.9 % $(273) (23)% $(59) (5)%Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests21 — — 0.2 % — % — % 21 n/m — — %Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc.$893 $1,187 $1,246 8.8 % 20.4 % 21.9 % $(294) (25)% $(59) (5)%(1) Percentage of revenue is calculated as the relevant revenue, expense, income or loss amount divided by total revenue, except for cost of processing and services and cost of product amounts, which are divided by the related component of revenue.34Table of Contents(In millions) Year ended December 31,First Data Payments Financial Corporateand Other TotalTotal revenue: 2019$4,078 $3,744 $2,407 $(42) $10,187 2018— 3,467 2,395 (39) 5,823 2017— 3,234 2,530 (68) 5,696 Revenue growth: 2019$4,078 $277 $12 $(3) $4,364 2019 percentage 8% 1 % 75 % 2018$— $233 $(135) $29 $127 2018 percentage 7% (5)% 2 % Operating income: 2019$1,031 $1,252 $805 $(1,479) $1,609 2018— 1,122 798 (167) 1,753 2017— 1,034 849 (351) 1,532 Operating income growth: 2019$1,031 $130 $7 $(1,312) $(144) 2019 percentage 12% 1 % (8)% 2018$— $88 $(51) $184 $221 2018 percentage 9% (6)% 14 % Operating margin: 201925.3% 33.4% 33.5 % 15.8 % 2018—% 32.3% 33.3 % 30.1 % 2017—% 32.0% 33.5 % 26.9 % Operating margin growth: (1) 2019 110bps 20bps (1,430)bps2018 30bps (20)bps 320bps(1) Represents the basis point growth or decline in operating margin. Operating margin percentages are calculated using actual, unrounded amounts.Total RevenueTotal revenue increased $4,364 million, or 75%, in 2019 and increased $127 million, or 2%, in 2018 compared to the prior years. The increase in 2019 was primarily driven by the incremental revenue from the First Data acquisition, which contributed $4,078 million of revenue during the year.Revenue in our First Data segment was comprised of $2,520 million, $927 million, and $631 million from our Global Business Solutions, Global Financial Solutions, and Network & Security Solutions businesses, respectively, since the date of acquisition.Revenue in our Payments segment increased $277 million, or 8%, in 2019 and increased $233 million, or 7%, in 2018 compared to the prior years. Revenue from acquired businesses contributed 4% and 2% to Payments segment revenue growth in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The remaining revenue growth in our Payments segment was driven by growth in our recurring revenue businesses, with our card services and electronic payments businesses contributing 2% and 1%, respectively, in each of 2019 and 2018, and our biller solutions business contributing 1% in 2018.Revenue in our Financial segment increased $12 million, or 1%, in 2019 and decreased $135 million, or 5%, in 2018 compared to the prior years. Financial segment revenue growth in both 2019 and 2018 was driven by growth in our bank solutions business from new business, customer migrations from in-house technology to outsourced solutions and growth with existing customers across a range of products. Dispositions, including the Lending Solutions business, reduced Financial segment revenue growth by 2% and 9% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, compared to the prior years.35Table of ContentsRevenue at Corporate and Other was relatively consistent in 2019 and 2018. Revenue at Corporate and Other increased $29 million from 2017 to 2018, primarily due to transition services revenue from the Lending Joint Ventures, which commenced in late March 2018. Total ExpensesTotal expenses increased $4,508 million, or 111%, and decreased $94 million, or 2%, in 2019 and 2018, respectively, compared to the prior years. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 84.2%, 69.9% and 73.1% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total expenses in 2019 include the expenses for First Data since the acquisition date, resulting in the overall significant increase in expenses compared to prior years. Total expenses and total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were reduced by the $227 million gain on sale of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business in 2018.Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was 46.8%, 46.7% and 47.4% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted by operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses in both 2019 and 2018. This included improvements of approximately 50 basis points and 80 basis points from scalable revenue growth in our Payments segment in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and approximately 60 basis points in 2018 from our account processing businesses, driven by product mix and expense management. Offsetting this reduction, cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue increased in 2019 by approximately 70 basis points from expenses shifting from cost of product to cost of processing as financial institutions continue to move from in-house technology to outsourced solutions, and by approximately 60 basis points from a non-cash impairment charge related to an international core processing platform. Client-focused, incremental investments in 2018 increased cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue by approximately 50 basis points compared to 2019 and 2017.Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 80.1%, 87.9% and 84.9% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The reduction in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2019 was driven by approximately 700 basis points from the First Data acquisition and by approximately 400 basis points due to expenses shifting from cost of product to cost of processing and services as financial institutions continue to move from in-house technology to outsourced solutions. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue increased by approximately 300 basis points and 130 basis points in 2019 and 2018, respectively, from a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue. The remaining increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was related to additional expenses associated with product development.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 32.2%, 21.1% and 20.2% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2019 was due to increased costs, including acquisition, integration and acquired intangible asset amortization, associated with the First Data acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased in 2018 compared to the prior year by approximately 50 basis points from the disposition of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business and by approximately 30 basis points from increased costs associated with acquisitions.The gains on sale of businesses of $15 million, $227 million and $10 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily resulted from the sale of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business, including contingent consideration received in 2019. Operating Income and Operating MarginTotal operating income decreased $144 million, or 8%, in 2019 and increased $221 million, or 14%, in 2018 compared to the prior years. Operating income in our First Data segment of $1,031 million, at an operating margin of 25.3%, in 2019 was incremental to our results due to the acquisition closing on July 29, 2019. Total operating margin decreased to 15.8% in 2019 from 30.1% in 2018 and 26.9% in 2017.Operating income in our Payments segment increased $130 million, or 12%, in 2019 and increased $88 million, or 9%, in 2018 compared to the prior years. Operating margin was 33.4%, 32.3% and 32.0% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, increasing 110 basis points in 2019 and 30 basis points in 2018 compared to the prior years. Scalable revenue growth in our recurring revenue businesses positively impacted Payments segment operating margin by approximately 100 basis points and 120 basis points in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Payments segment operating margin improvement was partially offset by approximately 50 basis points in 2019 and 30 basis points in 2018 as a result of acquisitions, and by approximately 50 basis points in 2018 from client-focused incremental investments.Operating income in our Financial segment increased $7 million, or 1%, in 2019 and decreased $51 million, or 6%, in 2018 compared to the prior years. Operating margin was 33.5%, 33.3% and 33.5% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, increasing 20 basis points in 2019 and decreasing 20 basis points in 2018 compared to the prior years. Financial segment operating margin improvement in 2019 was primarily due to expense reduction efforts in our international business of approximately 100 basis 36Table of Contentspoints, largely offset by approximately 80 basis points from a reduction in higher-margin software license revenue. Financial segment operating margin in 2018 was reduced by approximately 130 basis points due to the disposition of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business and 20 basis points from client-focused incremental investments, partially offset by contributions of approximately 130 basis points from our account processing businesses related to product mix and expense management. The operating loss in Corporate and Other increased $1,312 million and decreased $184 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, compared to the prior years. The increase in Corporate and Other operating loss in 2019 was due to the acquisition of First Data, including amortization of acquired intangible assets of $633 million, acquisition and integration related costs of $242 million, and other First Data related corporate expenses since the date of acquisition. Corporate and Other was favorably impacted by gains of $15 million, $227 million and $10 million from sales of businesses in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and negatively impacted in 2019 by a $48 million non-cash impairment charge related to an international core processing platform. The remaining operating loss in Corporate and Other in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily impacted by increased professional services expenses for data center consolidation and acquisition integration activities.Interest Expense, NetInterest expense, net increased $284 million, or 150%, in 2019 and increased $14 million, or 8%, in 2018 compared to the prior years due to the June 2019 issuance of $9.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes, the July 2019 issuance of €1.5 billion and £1.05 billion of fixed-rate senior notes and the $5.0 billion of term loan borrowings that were incurred for the purpose of funding the repayment of certain indebtedness of First Data and its subsidiaries on the closing date of the acquisition, as well as the September 2018 issuance of $2.0 billion of fixed-rate notes. See below under “Indebtedness” for a description of our financing related to the First Data acquisition.Debt Financing ActivitiesIn connection with the definitive merger agreement entered into on January 16, 2019 to acquire First Data, we entered into a bridge facility commitment letter providing for a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $17.0 billion for the purpose of refinancing certain indebtedness of First Data on the closing date of the acquisition. We recorded $98 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 associated with the bridge term loan facility and other refinancing and related activities in connection with the acquisition of First Data. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $50 million of net foreign currency transaction gains related to our foreign currency-denominated debt. See below under “Indebtedness” for a description of our financing related to the First Data acquisition. In 2018, we completed a cash tender offer for and redemption of our then-outstanding $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due October 2020, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $14 million.Income Tax ProvisionIncome tax provision as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was 18.3%, 24.3% and 11.6% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily related to equity compensation-related tax benefits, as well as discrete benefits due to a loss from subsidiary restructuring. The effective tax rate in 2018 includes $77 million of income tax expense associated with the $227 million gain on the sale of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business. The rate in 2018 was also impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) which, as further described below, reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Act made broad changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (i) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning in 2018; (ii) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (iii) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (iv) requiring U.S. federal taxable income to include certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; and (v) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense. The provisions of the Tax Act decreased our 2017 effective tax rate by 20.3%, primarily due to the re-evaluation of the net deferred tax liability to reflect the lower federal tax rate of 21 percent. Income from Investments in Unconsolidated AffiliatesOur share of net income from affiliates accounted for using the equity method of accounting, including the Lending Joint Ventures and affiliates under the merchant bank alliance program from the acquisition of First Data, is reported as income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates and the related tax expense is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including acquired intangible asset 37Table of Contentsamortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $29 million, $10 million and $32 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2017 includes our share of a net gain on the sale of a business at StoneRiver Group, L.P., a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest.Income from Discontinued OperationsIncome from discontinued operations in 2017 included a litigation settlement related to a prior disposition of $19 million, net of income tax of $7 million, and earnings related to an acquired business held for sale.Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests relates to the ownership interest of our alliance partners in our consolidated results, obtained through the acquisition of First Data. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $21 million.Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing OperationsNet income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted from continuing operations was $1.71, $2.87 and $2.86 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2019 included the results of operations of First Data from the date of the acquisition, along with transaction costs associated with the acquisition and acquired intangible asset amortization from the application of purchase accounting. Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted in 2018 by a gain of $0.37 per share on the sale of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business. Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted in 2017 by discrete income tax benefits associated with the Tax Act of $0.64 per share.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralOur primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $893 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

This increase was primarily attributable to improved operating results, the acquisition of First Data and favorable working capital fluctuations, including timing of interest payments and receivable collections. Net cash provided 38Table of Contentsby operating activities in 2019 also included a payment of $183 million associated with the settlement of treasury lock agreements related to First Data financing activities.Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 7% and 6% of our total revenue in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Share RepurchasesWe purchased $394 million and $1.91 billion of our common stock in 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019, we had approximately 21.8 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorizations. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. Acquisitions and Dispositions AcquisitionsOn July 29, 2019, we completed the acquisition of First Data for a total purchase price of $46.5 billion by acquiring 100% of the First Data stock that was issued and outstanding as of the date of acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, First Data stockholders received 286 million shares of common stock of Fiserv, Inc., at an exchange ratio of 0.303 shares of Fiserv, Inc. for each share of First Data common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. We also converted 15 million outstanding First Data equity awards into corresponding equity awards relating to common stock of Fiserv, Inc. in accordance with the exchange ratio. In addition, concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, we made a cash payment of $16.4 billion to repay existing First Data debt. We funded the transaction-related expenses and the repayment of First Data debt through a combination of available cash on-hand, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings.In October 2018, we acquired the debit card processing, ATM Managed Services, and MoneyPass® surcharge-free network of Elan Financial Services, a unit of U.S. Bancorp, for approximately $659 million including post-closing working capital adjustments, estimated contingent consideration related to earn-out provisions and future payments under a transition services agreement in excess of estimated fair value. We funded this acquisition by utilizing existing availability under our revolving credit facility.We completed four acquisitions in 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $384 million, net of cash acquired, along with earn-out provisions. We funded these acquisitions by utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility.DispositionsOn February 18, 2020, we completed the sale of a 60% controlling interest of our Investment Services business to a group of investors for gross proceeds of $591 million, resulting in an estimated pre-tax gain, including the remeasurement of the Company’s retained interest, of approximately $430 million. In connection with the acquisition of First Data, we acquired two businesses which we intended to sell. In October 2019, we completed the sales of these two businesses for aggregate proceeds of $133 million. In March 2018, we sold a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business, retaining 45% ownership interests in two joint ventures. We received gross sale proceeds of $419 million from the transactions. In August 2019, the Sagent Auto, LLC joint venture, formerly known as Fiserv Automotive Solutions, LLC, completed a merger with a third-party, resulting in a dilution of our ownership interest to 31% in the new combined entity, defi SOLUTIONS Group, LLC. In connection with the merger, Sagent Auto, LLC borrowed, in the aggregate, an additional $50 million on its variable-rate term loan facility and increased the notional amount of its variable-rate revolving credit facility by $10 million. We have guaranteed this incremental debt and do not anticipate that the joint venture will fail to fulfill its debt obligations. We recorded a $4 million liability for the estimated fair value of our obligations to stand ready to perform over term of the guarantees. Such guarantees will be amortized in future periods over the contractual term, based upon amounts to be received by us for the respective guarantees. We have guaranteed a total of $400 million and $45 million on the joint venture’s variable-rate term loan and revolving credit facilities, respectively. We have not made any payments under the guarantees, nor have we been called upon to do so. In January 2018, we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of Monitise for proceeds of £37 million ($50 million). 39Table of ContentsIndebtednessOur debt consisted of the following at December 31:(In millions) 2019 2018Short-term and current maturities of long-term debt: Lines of credit $150 $—Finance lease and other financing obligations 137 4Total short-term and current maturities of long-term debt $287 $4 Long-term debt: 2.7% senior notes due 2020 $850 $8504.75% senior notes due 2021 400 4003.5% senior notes due 2022 700 7003.8% senior notes due 2023 1,000 1,0000.375% senior notes due 2023 559 —2.75% senior notes due 2024 2,000 —3.85% senior notes due 2025 900 9002.25% senior notes due 2025 687 —3.2% senior notes due 2026 2,000 —1.125% senior notes due 2027 559 —4.2% senior notes due 2028 1,000 1,0003.5% senior notes due 2029 3,000 —1.625% senior notes due 2030 559 —3.0% senior notes due 2031 687 —4.4% senior notes due 2049 2,000 —Receivable securitized loan 500 —Term loan facility 3,950 —Unamortized discount and deferred financing costs (160) (29)Revolving credit facility 174 1,129Finance lease and other financing obligations 247 5Total long-term debt $21,612 $5,955At December 31, 2019, our debt consisted primarily of $16.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes and $4.0 billion of variable rate term loans. Interest on our U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes is paid semi-annually, while interest on our foreign currency-denominated senior notes is paid annually. Interest on our term loans is paid monthly. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2019. Additional information about our debt structure and associated instruments is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Bridge Term Loan FacilityOn January 16, 2019, in connection with the definitive merger agreement to acquire First Data, we entered into a bridge facility commitment letter pursuant to which a group of financial institutions committed to provide a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $17.0 billion for the purpose of funding the repayment of certain indebtedness of First Data and its subsidiaries on the closing date of the acquisition of First Data, making cash payments in lieu of fractional shares as part of the acquisition consideration and paying fees and expenses related to the acquisition, the refinancing and the related transactions. We recorded $98 million of expenses, reported within debt financing activities in the consolidated statements of income, related to the bridge term loan facility during the year ended December 31, 2019. The aggregate commitments of $17.0 billion under the bridge facility commitment letter were replaced with a corresponding amount of permanent financing through the term loan credit agreement and issuance of senior notes, as described below, resulting in the termination of the bridge term loan facility effective July 1, 2019.Senior NotesOn June 24, 2019, we completed an offering of $9.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.75% senior notes due in July 2024, $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.2% 40Table of Contentssenior notes due in July 2026, $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.5% senior notes due in July 2029 and $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.4% senior notes due in July 2049. The senior notes pay interest semi-annually on January 1 and July 1, commencing on January 1, 2020. The indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. We may, at our option, redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the applicable par call date.In March 2019, we entered into treasury lock agreements (“Treasury Locks”), designated as cash flow hedges, in the aggregate notional amount of $5.0 billion to manage exposure to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of fixed rate debt in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness of First Data and its subsidiaries. On June 24, 2019, concurrent with the issuance of the U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes described above, the Treasury Locks were settled resulting in a payment of $183 million that will be amortized to earnings over the terms of the originally forecasted interest payments.On July 1, 2019, we completed an offering of €1.5 billion aggregate principal amount and £1.05 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of €500 million aggregate principal amount of 0.375% senior notes due in July 2023, €500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.125% senior notes due in July 2027, €500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% senior notes due in July 2030, £525 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% senior notes due in July 2025, and £525 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior notes due in July 2031. The senior notes pay interest annually on July 1, commencing on July 1, 2020. The indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants that are substantially the same as those set forth in our U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes described above. In connection with the anticipated issuance of the foreign currency-denominated senior notes described above, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in June 2019 to minimize foreign currency exposure to the Euro and British Pound upon settlement of the proceeds from the foreign currency-denominated senior notes. The foreign exchange forward contracts matured on July 1, 2019, concurrent with the closing of the offering of the foreign currency-denominated senior notes. We realized foreign currency transaction gains of $3 million, reported within debt financing activities in the consolidated statements of income during the year ended December 31, 2019, from these foreign exchange forward contracts. In addition, we held a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of these foreign currency-denominated senior notes in Euro- and British Pound-denominated cash and cash equivalents. We realized foreign currency transaction losses of $19 million, reported within debt financing activities in the consolidated statements of income during the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Euro- and British Pound-denominated cash due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.A portion of the net proceeds from the senior note offerings described above was used in June 2019 to repay outstanding borrowings totaling $790 million under our amended and restated revolving credit facility. On July 29, 2019, concurrent with the acquisition of First Data, we used the remaining net proceeds from the senior notes offerings described above, as well as the net proceeds of the term loan facility described below and a drawing on our revolving credit facility described below, to repay $16.4 billion of existing First Data debt and to pay fees and our expenses related to such repayment, the First Data acquisition and related transactions. In September 2018, we completed an offering of $2.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.8% senior notes due in October 2023 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.2% senior notes due in October 2028. We used the net proceeds from such offering to repay the outstanding principal balance of $540 million under our then-existing term loan and the then-outstanding borrowings under our amended and restated revolving credit facility totaling $1.1 billion. In addition, we commenced a cash tender offer in September 2018 for any and all of our then-outstanding $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due October 2020. Upon expiration of the tender offer on September 26, 2018, $246 million was tendered. In October 2018, we retired the remaining outstanding $204 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes. We recorded a pre-tax loss, reported within debt financing activities in the consolidated statements of income, on early debt extinguishment of $14 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to these activities. Our 3.8% senior notes due in October 2023 and 4.2% senior notes due in October 2028 described above pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, commencing on April 1, 2019. In addition, we have outstanding 2.7% senior notes due in June 2020, 3.85% senior notes due in June 2025, 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021 and 3.5% senior notes due in October 2022. Our 2.7% senior notes due in June 2020 and 3.85% senior notes due in June 2025 pay interest at the stated rates semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. Our 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021 pay interest at the stated rate on June 15 and December 15 of each year. Our 3.5% senior notes due in October 2022 pay interest at the stated rate on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The interest rate applicable to the senior notes described in this paragraph is subject to an increase of up 41Table of Contentsto two percent in the event that the credit rating assigned to such notes is downgraded below investment grade. The indentures governing the senior notes described in this paragraph contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. At December 31, 2019, the 2.7% notes due in June 2020 were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility. Term Loan FacilityOn February 15, 2019, we entered into a new term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions pursuant to which such financial institutions committed to provide us with a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion, consisting of $1.5 billion in commitments to provide loans with a three-year maturity and $3.5 billion in commitments to provide loans with a five-year maturity. On July 26, 2019, we entered into an amendment to our term loan credit facility to (i) remove as a condition precedent to borrowings on the closing date of the acquisition of First Data the requirement that amounts under the Receivables Financing Agreement, as defined below, be repaid and the related liens and guarantees be terminated in order to allow First Data’s accounts receivable securitization program, as described below, to remain in place following consummation of the acquisition and (ii) amend the debt and liens covenants to increase our flexibility to enter into receivables financing arrangements in the future. On July 29, 2019, concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of First Data, the term loan credit agreement was funded. Loans drawn under the term loan facility are subject to amortization at a quarterly rate of 1.25% for the first eight quarters and 1.875% each quarter thereafter (with loans outstanding under the five-year tranche subject to amortization at a quarterly rate of 2.5% after the fourth anniversary of the commencement of amortization), with accrued and unpaid amortization amounts required to be paid on the last business day in December of each year. Borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus in each case, a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate on the term loan facility borrowings was 3.0% at December 31, 2019. We were also required to pay a ticking fee that accrued on the aggregate undrawn commitments under the term loan facility at a per annum rate based upon our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The term loan credit agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default, that are substantially the same as those set forth in our existing amended revolving credit facility, as described below.Revolving Credit FacilityIn September 2018, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement that restated our then-existing revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and extended its maturity from April 2020 to September 2023. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The amended and restated revolving credit facility contained various restrictions and covenants that required us, among other things, to (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times our consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and expenses and certain other adjustments (“EBITDA”) during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions, and (ii) maintain consolidated EBITDA of at least three times our consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended. On February 6, 2019, we entered into an amendment to our amended and restated revolving credit facility to (i) amend the maximum leverage ratio covenant to permit us to elect to increase the permitted maximum leverage ratio from three and one-half times our consolidated EBITDA to either four times or four and one-half times our consolidated EBITDA for a specified period following certain acquisitions and (ii) permit us to make drawings under the revolving credit facility on the closing date of our acquisition of First Data subject to only limited conditions. In November 2019, we elected to increase the permitted maximum leverage ratio to four times our consolidated EBITDA pursuant to the terms of the amendment described above. In addition, on February 15, 2019, we entered into a second amendment to our existing revolving credit agreement in order to increase the aggregate commitments available thereunder by $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion of total capacity, and to make certain additional amendments to facilitate the operation of the combined business following the acquisition of First Data. Further on July 26, 2019, we entered into a third amendment to our existing revolving credit agreement to (i) remove as a condition precedent to borrowings on the closing date of the acquisition of First Data the requirement that amounts under the Receivables Financing Agreement, as defined below, be repaid, and (ii) amend the debt and liens covenants to increase our flexibility to enter into receivables financing arrangements in the future. The increased commitments and amendments contemplated by the second and third amendments to the revolving credit facility became effective upon the closing of the acquisition of First Data. Borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility continue to bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus in each case a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings was 2.68% at December 31, 2019.42Table of ContentsForeign Lines of Credit and Other ArrangementsIn connection with the acquisition of First Data, we assumed certain short-term lines of credit with foreign banks and alliance partners primarily to fund settlement activity. These arrangements are primarily associated with international operations and are in various functional currencies, the most significant of which are the Australian dollar, Polish zloty, Euro and Argentine peso. We had amounts outstanding on these lines of credit totaling $150 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 13.4% at December 31, 2019. Receivable Securitized LoanIn connection with the acquisition of First Data, we acquired a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary, First Data Receivables, LLC (“FDR”). FDR is a party to certain receivables financing arrangements, including an agreement (“Receivables Financing Agreement”) with certain financial institutions and other persons from time to time party thereto as lenders and group agents, pursuant to which certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have agreed to transfer and contribute receivables to FDR, and FDR in turn may obtain borrowings from the financial institutions and other lender parties to the Receivables Financing Agreement secured by liens on those receivables. FDR’s assets are not available to satisfy the obligations of any other of our entities or affiliates, and FDR’s creditors would be entitled, upon its liquidation, to be satisfied out of FDR’s assets prior to any assets or value in FDR becoming available to us. The receivables held by FDR are recorded within trade accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2019, FDR held $773 million in receivables as part of the securitization program. The maximum borrowing capacity, subject to collateral availability, under the Receivables Financing Agreement at December 31, 2019 was $500 million. FDR utilized the receivables as collateral in borrowings of $500 million, at an average interest rate of 2.61%, at December 31, 2019. The term of the Receivables Financing Agreement is through July 2022. OtherAccess to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2019, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rates payable on certain of our senior notes, our term loans and our revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates on the senior notes are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.Cash and Cash EquivalentsInvestments (other than those included in settlement assets) with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash are considered to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we held $893 million and $415 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively.The table below details the cash and cash equivalents at December 31: 2019 2018(In millions)Domestic International Total Domestic International TotalAvailable$383 $208 $591 $356 $59 $415Unavailable130(1) 172(2) 302 — — —Total $513 $380 $893 $356 $59 $415(1) Represents cash held by certain domestic entities that is not available to fund operations outside of these entities unless the Board of Directors for said entities declares a dividend. In addition, one of these entities is subject to regulatory capital requirements that must be satisfied before a dividend may be declared.(2) Distributions of these funds are subject to certain of our joint ventures’ Board of Directors authorization.43Table of ContentsRestructuring CostsIn connection with the acquisition of First Data, we have begun implementing certain integration plans focused on reducing our overall cost structure, including vendor spend and the elimination of duplicate costs. We recorded restructuring charges related to certain of these integration activities of $56 million, primarily reported in cost of processing and service and selling, general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statements of income, based upon committed actions during the year ended December 31, 2019. We continue to evaluate operating efficiencies and anticipate incurring additional costs in the next few years in connection with these activities, but are unable to estimate those amounts at this time as such plans are not yet finalized.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing. The following table details our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019:(In millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsLong-term debt including interest (1) (2) $27,989 $915 $4,249 $8,329 $14,496Minimum finance lease payments (1) (3) 238 83 137 13 5Minimum operating lease payments (1) (3) 817 153 262 190 212Purchase obligations (1) 1,365 542 430 243 150Income tax obligations 145 32 68 32 13Total $30,554 $1,725 $5,146 $8,807 $14,876(1) Interest, finance lease, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis.(2) The calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, no additional refinancing or lending occurs, except for our 2.7% senior notes due in June 2020 as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility maturing in September 2023, and the variable rate on the revolving credit facility and term loans are priced at the rate in effect at December 31, 2019.(3) Excludes $302 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for finance leases and $4 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for operating leases that have been signed but not yet commenced. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency. Our senior management actively monitors these risks.Interest Rate RiskWe manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt. Based on our outstanding debt balances and interest rates at December 31, 2019, a 1% increase in variable interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately $48 million.In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested into short-term, highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. A 1% decrease in variable interest rates would decrease annual interest-related income related to settlement assets by approximately $32 million.Foreign Currency RiskWe conduct business globally and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar-denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We manage the exposure to these risks through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and non-derivative net investment hedges.Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arise from our non-U.S. operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency. In 2019, approximately 12% of our total revenue was generated outside the U.S. The major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the Euro, the British Pound, the Indian Rupee and the Argentine Peso. A movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which our revenue and profits are denominated at 44Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2019, would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our reported pre-tax income, including the results of First Data from the date of acquisition, of approximately $25 million as follows:(In millions) 2019Euro $7British Pound 4Indian Rupee 3Argentine Peso 2Other 9 Total increase or decrease $25We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency exposure to our operating costs in India. At December 31, 2019, the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately $178 million. In addition, we designated our foreign currency-denominated senior notes as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to changes in the value of our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.45Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:20:25.027441

We provide account processing and digital banking solutions; card issuer processing and network services; payments; e-commerce; merchant acquiring and processing; and the Clover® cloud-based point-of-sale (“POS”) solution. We serve clients around the globe, including banks, credit unions, other financial institutions, corporate clients and merchants.On July 29, 2019, we acquired First Data Corporation (“First Data”), a global leader in commerce-enabling technology and solutions for merchants, financial institutions and card issuers. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, we realigned our reportable segments to reflect our new management structure and organizational responsibilities (“Segment Realignment”) following the acquisition of First Data. Our operations are comprised of the Merchant Acceptance (“Acceptance”) segment, the Financial Technology (“Fintech”) segment and the Payments and Network (“Payments”) segment. The consolidated financial statements include the financial results of First Data from the date of acquisition. Segment results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 have been restated to reflect the Segment Realignment.The Acceptance segment provides a wide range of commerce-enabling solutions to merchants of all sizes and types around the world. These solutions include POS merchant acquiring and digital commerce services; mobile payment services; security and fraud protection products and services; CaratSM, our omnichannel commerce solution; and our cloud-based Clover POS platform, which includes a marketplace for proprietary and third-party business applications. The businesses in the Acceptance segment are subject to a modest level of seasonality, with the first quarter generally experiencing the lowest level of revenue and the fourth quarter experiencing the highest level of revenue.The Fintech segment provides financial institutions around the world with technology solutions that enable them to process customer deposit and loan accounts and manage general ledger and central information files, as well as other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions such as digital banking, financial and risk management, cash management, professional services and consulting, and item processing and source capture services. Our businesses in this segment also provide products and services to corporate clients to facilitate the management of financial processes and transactions.The Payments segment primarily provides financial institutions and corporate clients with the products and services required to process digital payment transactions, including card transactions such as debit, credit and prepaid card processing and services, a range of network services, security and fraud protection products, card production and print services. In addition, our businesses in this segment offer non-card digital payment software and services, including bill payment, account-to-account transfers, person-to-person payments, electronic billing, and security and fraud protection products. 31Table of ContentsThe majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts with high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide within our segments are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature.Corporate and Other supports the reportable segments described above, and consists of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, unallocated corporate expenses and other activities that are not considered when we evaluate segment performance, such as gains or losses on sales of businesses, costs associated with acquisition and divestiture activity, and our Output Solutions postage reimbursements. Corporate and Other also includes the historical results of our Investment Services business, of which we sold a 60% controlling interest in February 2020, as well as certain transition services revenue associated with various dispositions. Acquisitions and DispositionsWe frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of businesses to execute on our strategy. We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; an opportunity to change industry dynamics; a way to achieve business scale; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies.AcquisitionsOn March 2, 2020, we acquired MerchantPro Express LLC (“MerchantPro”), an independent sales organization (“ISO”) that provides processing services, POS equipment and merchant cash advances to businesses across the United States. MerchantPro is included within the Acceptance segment and further expands our merchant services business. On March 18, 2020, we acquired Bypass Mobile, LLC (“Bypass”), an independent software vendor and innovator in enterprise POS systems for sports and entertainment venues, food service management providers and national restaurant chains. Bypass is included within the Acceptance segment and further enhances our omni-commerce capabilities, enabling enterprise businesses to deliver a seamless customer experience that spans physical and digital channels. On May 11, 2020, we acquired Inlet, LLC (“Inlet”), a provider of secure digital delivery solutions for enterprise and middle-market billers’ invoices and statements. Inlet is included within the Payments segment and further enhances our digital bill payment strategy. We acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $167 million, net of $2 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $45 million.On July 29, 2019, we acquired First Data for a total purchase price of $46.5 billion by acquiring 100% of the First Data stock that was issued and outstanding as of the date of acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, First Data stockholders received 286 million shares of common stock of Fiserv, Inc., at an exchange ratio of 0.303 shares of Fiserv, Inc. for each share of First Data common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. We also converted 15 million outstanding First Data equity awards into corresponding equity awards relating to common stock of Fiserv, Inc. in accordance with the exchange ratio. In addition, concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, we made a cash payment of $16.4 billion to repay existing First Data debt. We funded the transaction-related expenses and the repayment of First Data debt through a combination of available cash on-hand, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, and term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings. The acquisition of First Data, included within the Acceptance and Payments segments, increases our footprint as a global payments and financial technology provider by expanding the portfolio of services provided to financial institutions, corporate and merchant clients and consumers.On October 31, 2018, we acquired the debit card processing, ATM Managed Services, and MoneyPass® surcharge-free network of Elan Financial Services, a unit of U.S. Bancorp, for approximately $659 million including post-closing working capital adjustments, estimated contingent consideration related to earn-out provisions and future payments under a transition services agreement in excess of estimated fair value.

On January 22, 2021, we acquired Ondot Systems, Inc., a digital experience platform provider for financial institutions. This acquisition, to be included within the Payments segment, will further expand our digital capabilities, enhancing our suite of integrated solutions spanning card-based payments, digital banking platforms, core banking, and merchant solutions to enable clients of all sizes to deliver frictionless, digital-first and personalized experiences to their customers.DispositionsEffective July 1, 2020, we and Bank of America (“BANA”) dissolved the Banc of America Merchant Services joint venture (“BAMS” or the “joint venture”), of which we maintained a 51% controlling ownership interest. Upon dissolution of the joint venture’s operations, the joint venture transferred a proportionate share of value, primarily the client contracts, to each party via 32Table of Contentsan agreed upon contractual separation. The remaining activities of the joint venture will consist of supporting the transition of the business to each party and an orderly wind down of remaining BAMS assets and liabilities. The revenues and expenses of the BAMS joint venture were consolidated into our financial results though the date of dissolution. The business transferred to us will continue to be operated and managed within our Acceptance segment.We will continue to provide merchant processing and related services to former BAMS clients allocated to BANA, at BAMS pricing, through June 2023. We will also provide processing and other support services to new BANA merchant clients pursuant to a five-year non-exclusive agreement which, after June 2023, will also apply to the former BAMS clients allocated to BANA. In addition, both companies are entitled to certain transition services, at fair value, from each other through June 2023.On February 18, 2020, we sold a 60% controlling interest of our Investment Services business, subsequently renamed as Tegra118, LLC (“Tegra118”), which is reported within Corporate and Other following the Segment Realignment. We received pre-tax proceeds of $578 million, net of related expenses, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of $428 million, with a related tax expense of $112 million. Our retained interest is accounted for as an equity method investment. On February 2, 2021, Tegra118 completed a merger with a third party, resulting in a dilution of our ownership interest in the combined new entity, Wealthtech Holdings, LLC.In connection with the acquisition of First Data, we acquired two businesses which we intended to sell. In October 2019, we completed the sales, at acquired fair value, of these two businesses for aggregate proceeds of $133 million. On March 29, 2018, we sold a 55% controlling interest of our Lending Solutions business, which was reported within the Fintech segment, retaining 45% ownership interests in two joint ventures (the “Lending Joint Ventures”). In conjunction with this transaction, we entered into transition services agreements to provide, at fair value, various administration, business process outsourcing and data center related services for defined periods to the Lending Joint Ventures. We received gross sale proceeds of $419 million from the transactions. In August 2019, the Sagent Auto, LLC joint venture, formerly known as Fiserv Automotive Solutions, LLC, completed a merger with a third party, resulting in the dilution of our ownership interest to 31% in the combined entity, defi SOLUTIONS Group, LLC. Our remaining ownership interest in the Lending Joint Ventures are accounted for as equity method investments. In addition, in January 2018, we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of Monitise for proceeds of £37 million ($50 million).Enterprise Priorities We aspire to move money and information in a way that moves the world by delivering superior value for our clients through leading technology, targeted innovation and excellence in everything we do. We achieve this through active portfolio management of our business, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our long-term priorities are to (i) deliver integration value from the First Data acquisition; (ii) continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (iii) enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and (iv) deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.Industry TrendsThe global payments landscape continues to evolve, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, e-commerce and innovation in real-time payments infrastructure. Because of this growth, competition also continues to evolve. Business and consumer expectations continue to rise, with a focus on convenience and security. To meet these expectations, payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology, expanding the use of data and enhancing the customer experience.Financial InstitutionsThe market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly. The traditional financial industry and other market entrants regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, risk management, lending and investment products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. These conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include electronic payments and delivery methods such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as “digital channels.”33Table of ContentsThe focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. We expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. In addition to the trends described above, the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. If a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition, we receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. These fees can vary from period to period with the variance depending on the quantum of financial institution merger activity in a given period and whether or not our clients are involved in the activity. Our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. Furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth.MerchantsThe rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and e-commerce, driven by consumers’ desire for simpler, more efficient shopping experiences, has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers in high-growth online and mobile settings, which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments. Merchants are demanding simpler, integrated and modern POS systems to help manage their everyday business operations. When combined with the ever-increasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services, merchants have sought modern POS systems to streamline this complexity. Furthermore, merchants can now search, discover, compare, purchase and even install a new POS system through direct, digital-only experiences. This direct, digital-only channel is quickly becoming a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities, especially with respect to smaller merchants. In addition, there are numerous software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions in the industry, many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring within their software as a way to further monetize their client relationships. SaaS solutions that integrate payments are often referred to as Independent Software Vendors (or “ISVs”), and we believe there are thousands of these potential distribution partnership opportunities available to us. We believe that our merchant acquiring products and solutions create compelling value propositions for merchant clients of all sizes, from small and mid-sized businesses (or “SMBs”) to medium-sized regional businesses to global enterprise merchants, and across all verticals. Furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with valued partnerships with merchant acquiring businesses of small, medium and large financial institutions, and non-financial institutions, gives us a solid foundation for growth.Recent Market ConditionsIn 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was identified and has since continued to spread. In March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as imposing travel restrictions and bans, quarantines, social distancing guidelines, shelter-in-place or lock-down orders and other similar limitations, adversely impacting global economic activity and contributing to significant volatility in financial markets. From time to time during the second half of 2020 and into 2021, some jurisdictions have eased restrictions in an effort to reopen their economies. While this has been successful in some places, others have had to reinstate restrictions to curb the spread of the virus.We have taken several actions since the onset of the pandemic to protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees while maintaining business continuity. These actions include, among others, requiring a majority of our employees to work remotely, eliminating non-essential travel, suspending all non-essential visitors to our facilities, disinfecting facilities and workspaces extensively and frequently, providing personal protective equipment to associates and requiring employees who 34Table of Contentsmust be present at our facilities to adhere to a variety of safety protocols. In addition, we have expanded paid time-off for employees impacted by COVID-19, provided increased pay for certain employees involved in critical infrastructure who could not work remotely, and expanded our Fiserv Cares program to benefit employees in need around the world. We expect to continue such safety measures for the foreseeable future and may take further actions, or adapt these existing policies, as government authorities may require or recommend or as we may determine to be in the best interest of our employees, clients and vendors. Our operating performance is subject to global economic and market conditions, as well as their impacts on levels of consumer and business spending. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related decline in global economic activity, we experienced a significant decrease in payments volume and transactions beginning in late March 2020 that negatively impacted our merchant acquiring and payment-related businesses, which earn transaction-based fees, as well as modest declines in other businesses. Merchant acquiring transaction and payment volumes began to partially recover in May 2020 and continued to improve into July 2020; thereafter, the monthly volume growth rate as compared to the prior year stabilized for the balance of the year. While recent business trends demonstrate positive momentum, the uncertainty caused by the pandemic creates an economic environment where our future financial results remain difficult to anticipate. We currently expect payments volume and transactions to continue to improve throughout 2021.Throughout 2020, we also took several actions to manage discretionary costs including, among others, limiting the hiring of new employees, limiting third-party spending and the temporary suspension of certain employee-related benefits, including company matching contributions to the Fiserv 401(k) Savings Plan as well as the discount on shares purchased under the Fiserv, Inc. Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Effective January 1, 2021, company matching contributions were re-established to equal 100% on the first 1% contributed and 25% on the next 4% contributed for eligible participants. In addition, we reassessed and deferred certain capital expenditures that were originally planned for 2020. We will continue to monitor and assess developments related to COVID-19 and implement appropriate actions to minimize the risk to our operations of any material adverse developments. Ultimately, the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operational and financial performance will depend on, among other matters, the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic; governmental and private sector responses to the pandemic and the impact of such responses on us; the level of success of global vaccination efforts; and the impact of the pandemic on our employees, clients, vendors, operations and sales, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates.AcquisitionsFrom time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. The determination of fair value requires estimates about discount rates, growth and retention rates, royalty rates, expected future cash flows and other future events that are judgmental in nature. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Additional information regarding our acquisitions is included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.35Table of ContentsGoodwill and Intangible Assets We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is one level below our reportable segments. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the prior test’s amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test.The quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using both a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. In connection with the Segment Realignment, certain of our reporting units changed in composition in which goodwill was allocated to such reporting units using a relative fair value approach. Accordingly, we performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment in the first quarter of 2020 for those reporting units impacted by the Segment Realignment and determined that our goodwill was not impaired based on an assessment of various qualitative factors, as described above. Our most recent annual impairment assessment of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2020 determined that our goodwill of $36 billion was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units exceeded the carrying values. However, for four of our reporting units that were acquired as part of the First Data acquisition, with aggregate goodwill of $12 billion, the excess of the respective reporting unit’s fair value over carrying value ranged from 14 to 21 percent. If future operating performance is below our expectations or there are changes to forecasted revenue growth rates, risk-adjusted discount rates, effective income tax rates, or some combination thereof, a decline in the fair value of the reporting units could result in, and we may be required to record, a goodwill impairment charge. It is also reasonably possible that future developments related to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our recently acquired (recorded at fair value) First Data businesses, such as an increased duration and intensity of the pandemic and/or government-imposed shutdowns, prolonged economic downturn or recession, or lack of governmental support for recovery, could have a future material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment. We have no accumulated goodwill impairment through December 31, 2020. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We review capitalized software development costs for impairment at each reporting date. Recoverability of intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to either the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or the net realizable value of the asset, depending on the type of asset. Determining future cash flows and net realizable values involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future economic and market conditions. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. As a practical expedient, we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. Contracts with customers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue is generated from account- and transaction-based fees for data processing, merchant transaction processing and acquiring, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds transfer and debit/credit processing services; consulting and professional services; and software maintenance for ongoing client support.36Table of ContentsWe recognize processing and services revenues in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services, in which case revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services. Our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when- and if-needed basis (a stand-ready obligation) and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer. These services are typically provided under a fixed or declining (tier-based) price per unit based on volume of service; however, pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees. Fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis.ProductProduct revenue is generated from print and card production sales, as well as software license sales. For software license agreements that are distinct, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery, assuming a contract is deemed to exist. Revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization, modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended, such as labor hours, to measure progress towards completion. For arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer, a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software.We also sell or lease hardware (POS devices) and other peripherals as part of our contracts with customers. Hardware typically consists of terminals or Clover devices. We do not manufacture hardware, rather we purchase hardware from third-party vendors and hold such hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer. We account for sales of hardware as a separate performance obligation and recognize the revenue at its standalone selling price when the customer obtains control of the hardware.Significant JudgmentsWe use the following methods, inputs and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize. For multi-element arrangements, we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement, and if a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.Technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings. Whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers.The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. We include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price. To the extent that variable consideration is not constrained, we include an estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract. We may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted. The transaction price (including any discounts or rebates) is allocated between distinct goods and services in a multi-element arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines. Significant judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service.Contract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price (or both) of the contract or when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by us. When a contract modification occurs, it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as (i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract. Further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract, including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation.Additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.37Table of ContentsIncome TaxesThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires management’s judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, sometimes made more complex by our global footprint. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish a liability for known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. In establishing a liability for known tax exposures, assumptions are made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position will be sustained. A tax benefit with respect to a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits, considering the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. The amount of tax benefit recognized reflects the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on settlement with the relevant taxing authority. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our liability for known tax exposures as appropriate.We maintain net operating loss carryforwards in various taxing jurisdictions, resulting in the establishment of deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, based upon the weight of all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we have considered the relative impact of all of the available positive and negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income and available tax planning strategies. However, there could be a material impact to our effective tax rate if there is a significant change in our judgment. To the extent our judgment changes, the valuation allowances are then adjusted, generally through the provision for income taxes, in the period in which the change in facts and circumstances occurs. Additional information regarding our income taxes is included in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.Results of OperationsComponents of Revenue and ExpensesThe following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue, which in 2020 represented 82% of our total revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; certain depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses.ProductProduct revenue, which in 2020 represented 18% of our total revenue, is primarily derived from print and card production sales, as well as software license sales and hardware (POS devices) sales. Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; hardware; personnel; infrastructure costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses.Synergies from the First Data Acquisition Following the acquisition of First Data, we continue to implement our post-merger integration plans to achieve synergies from future expected economic benefits, including enhanced revenue growth from expanded capabilities and geographic presence as well as substantial cost savings from duplicative overhead, streamlined operations and enhanced operational efficiency. At December 31, 2020, we have achieved a significant portion of revenue and cost synergies and expect to meet or exceed our previously announced targets.38Table of ContentsFinancial ResultsThe following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year-to-year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The financial results presented below have been affected by the acquisition of First Data and other acquisitions, dispositions, debt financing activities, and foreign currency fluctuations. The amounts from the acquired First Data businesses were included in our results for the full year in 2020 and for the five months, since the July 29,2019 acquisition date, in 2019.

The First Data acquisition, which was completed on July 29, 2019, contributed $5,067 million and $4,078 million of incremental revenue during 2020 and 2019, respectively, with $3,114 million and $2,571 million to the Acceptance segment, $1,616 million and $1,230 million to the Payments segment, and $337 million and $277 million to Corporate and Other, during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Conversely, dispositions reduced revenue by $348 million and $54 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the prior years. Revenue in our Acceptance segment increased $2,951 million, or 115%, in 2020, driven by the acquisition of First Data on July 29, 2019, which contributed incremental revenue of $3,114 million during the first seven months of 2020 and the entire $2,571 million of Acceptance segment revenue in 2019. The dissolution of the BAMS joint venture on July 1, 2020 reduced Acceptance segment revenue growth in 2020 by 6% compared to 2019. In addition, revenue in our Acceptance segment, which earns transaction-based fees, was adversely affected by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the last two weeks of March 2020 and throughout the remainder of the year. Merchant acquiring transaction and payment volumes began to partially recover in May 2020 and continued to improve into July 2020; thereafter, the monthly volume growth rate as compared to the prior year stabilized for the balance of the year.40Table of ContentsRevenue in our Fintech segment decreased $41 million, or 1%, in 2020 and increased $25 million, or 1%, in 2019 compared to the prior years. Dispositions, including our remittance solutions business in December 2019 and Lending Solutions business in March 2018, reduced Fintech segment revenue growth by 1% and 2% in 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the prior years. Recurring revenue growth from higher processing volumes in 2020 was offset by a reduction of 2% from a decline in termination fee revenue. Fintech segment revenue growth in 2019 was driven by growth in our bank solutions business from new business, customer migrations from in-house technology to outsourced solutions and growth with existing customers across a range of products.Revenue in our Payments segment increased $1,595 million, or 41%, in 2020 and increased $1,501 million, or 62%, in 2019 compared to the prior years. Revenue from acquired businesses, including First Data, contributed 41% and 57% to Payments segment revenue growth in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Payments segment revenue in 2020 was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic while the remaining growth in 2019 was driven by expansion in our recurring revenue businesses, with our card services and electronic payments businesses contributing 4% and 1%, respectively. Revenue at Corporate and Other increased $160 million, or 21%, in 2020 and increased $267 million, or 54%, in 2019 compared to the prior years. Postage revenue from the First Data acquisition contributed 44% and 56% to the Corporate and Other growth in 2020 and 2019, respectively, while the disposition of a 60% controlling interest of our Investment Services business reduced revenue growth by 19% in 2020. Total Expenses Total expenses increased $4,422 million, or 52%, in 2020 and increased $4,508 million, or 111%, in 2019 compared to the prior years. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 87.5%, 84.2% and 69.9% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Total expenses in 2020 and 2019 contain the incremental expenses, including acquired intangible asset amortization, of First Data from the date of acquisition, resulting in the overall significant increase in expenses compared to the prior years. The incremental expenses during 2020 from the First Data acquisition were primarily due to 2020 containing seven more months of expenses from First Data as compared to 2019. Total expenses were reduced by a $428 million gain on sale of a 60% interest of our Investment Services business and a $36 million gain on the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture in 2020, and a $227 million gain on sale of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business in 2018.Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was 47.8%, 46.8% and 46.7% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Expense management in our recurring revenue businesses favorably impacted cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue in both 2020 and 2019 compared to the prior years. Conversely, cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue increased in 2020 by approximately 200 basis points, from integration-related expenses associated with the First Data acquisition, including $118 million of accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with the termination of certain vendor contracts, and by approximately 100 basis points from incremental First Data acquisition intangible amortization. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue increased in 2019 by approximately 70 basis points from expenses shifting from cost of product to cost of processing as financial institutions continue to move from in-house technology to outsourced solutions, and by approximately 60 basis points from a non-cash impairment charge related to an international core processing platform. Client-focused incremental investments increased cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue in 2018 by approximately 50 basis points.Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 74.7%, 80.1% and 87.9% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The reduction in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2020 and 2019 was driven by the First Data acquisition. In addition, cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2019 decreased by approximately 400 basis points due to expenses shifting from cost of product to cost of processing and services as financial institutions continue to move from in-house technology to outsourced solutions, and increased by approximately 300 basis points from a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue as compared to 2018.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 38.1%, 32.2% and 21.1% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Incremental acquired intangible asset amortization from the First Data acquisition increased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue by approximately 600 basis points in each of 2020 and 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2020 increased by approximately 120 basis points from higher integration-related expenses, which was largely offset by synergy related cost reductions. The remaining increase in 2019 was due to increased costs associated with the First Data acquisition, including integration-related expenses. The gains on sale of businesses of $464 million, $15 million and $227 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily resulted from the sale of a 60% interest of our Investment Services business in February 2020, the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture in July 2020, and the sale of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business in March 2018, including contingent consideration received in 2019.41Table of ContentsOperating Income and Operating Margin Total operating income increased $243 million, or 15%, in 2020 and decreased $144 million, or 8%, in 2019 compared to the prior years. Total operating margin decreased to 12.5% in 2020 from 15.8% in 2019 and 30.1% in 2018. Operating income in our Acceptance segment was $764 million in 2019 and increased $663 million, or 87%, in 2020, driven by the acquisition of First Data. Operating margin was 25.9% and 29.7% in 2020 and 2019, respectively, decreasing 380 basis points in 2020 compared to the prior year. Operating income and margin in our Acceptance segment, which earns transaction-based fees, was adversely affected in the last two weeks of March and throughout the remainder of 2020 due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Merchant acquiring transaction and payment volumes and related operating income began to partially recover in May 2020 and continued to improve into July 2020; thereafter, the monthly volume growth rate as compared to the prior year stabilized for the balance of the year. Operating income in our Fintech segment increased $107 million, or 12%, in 2020 and increased $34 million, or 4%, in 2019 compared to the prior years. Operating margin was 34.2%, 30.1% and 29.2% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, increasing 410 basis points in 2020 and increasing 90 basis points in 2019 compared to the prior years. Fintech segment operating margin improvement in 2020 compared to 2019 was driven by expense management across the segment, including technology and vendor synergy savings of approximately 330 basis points and additional expense reductions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic of approximately 120 basis points, partially offset by approximately 100 basis points from a reduction in contract termination fee revenue. Fintech segment operating margin improvement in 2019 compared to 2018 was driven by expense management efforts in our Fintech international businesses of approximately 100 basis points, partially offset by approximately 70 basis points from a reduction in higher-margin software license revenue. Client-focused incremental investments reduced Fintech segment operating margin in 2018 by approximately 40 basis points. Operating income in our Payments segment increased $703 million, or 42%, in 2020 and increased $577 million, or 53%, in 2019 compared to the prior years. Operating margin was 42.9%, 42.4% and 44.9% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, increasing 50 basis points in 2020 and decreasing 250 basis points in 2019 compared to the prior years. The reduction in Payments segment operating margin in 2019 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of First Data, while the impact of cost synergies drove the margin expansion in 2020.The operating loss in Corporate and Other increased $1,230 million in 2020 and increased $1,519 million in 2019 compared to the prior years. The increase in Corporate and Other operating loss was primarily due to the acquisition of First Data, including incremental amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1,035 million and $799 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, incremental acquisition and integration-related costs of $441 million and $275 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and other First Data related corporate expenses since the date of acquisition. Corporate and Other was favorably impacted by gains from sales of businesses of $464 million, $15 million and $227 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and negatively impacted in 2019 by a $48 million non-cash impairment charge related to an international core processing platform. Interest Expense, NetInterest expense, net increased $236 million, or 50%, in 2020 and increased $284 million, or 150%, in 2019 compared to prior years, primarily due to the June 2019 issuance of $9.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes, the July 2019 issuance of €1.5 billion and £1.05 billion of fixed-rate senior notes and the term loan borrowings that were incurred for the purpose of funding the repayment of certain indebtedness of First Data and its subsidiaries on the closing date of the acquisition, as well as the September 2018 issuance of $2.0 billion of fixed-rate notes.Debt Financing ActivitiesIn connection with the merger agreement entered into on January 16, 2019 to acquire First Data, we entered into a bridge facility commitment letter providing for a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $17.0 billion for the purpose of refinancing certain indebtedness of First Data on the closing date of the acquisition. We recorded $98 million of expense in 2019 associated with the bridge term loan facility and other refinancing and related activities in connection with the acquisition of First Data. In addition, in 2019 we recorded $50 million of net foreign currency transaction gains related to our foreign currency-denominated debt. In 2018, we completed a cash tender offer for and redemption of our then-outstanding $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2020, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $14 million.42Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense)Other income (expense) increased $34 million in 2020 and decreased $11 million in 2019 compared to prior years. Other income (expense) includes net foreign currency transaction gains and losses, gains or losses from a change in fair value of investments in certain equity securities, and amounts related to the release of risk under our non-contingent guarantee arrangements and changes in the provision of estimated credit losses associated with certain indebtedness of the Lending Joint Ventures. In addition, other income includes $19 million in 2020 related to a pre-tax gain on the sale of certain lease receivables.Income Tax ProvisionIncome tax provision as a percentage of income before income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was 16.7%, 18.3% and 24.3% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily the result of foreign income tax benefits from a subsidiary restructuring, partially offset by the impact of an increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% in 2020. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily related to equity compensation-related tax benefits, as well as discrete benefits due to a loss from subsidiary restructuring.Income from Investments in Unconsolidated AffiliatesOur share of net income or loss from affiliates accounted for using the equity method of accounting, including merchant bank alliance affiliates from the acquisition of First Data, is reported as income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates and the related tax expense or benefit is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $0 million, $29 million and $10 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests relates to the ownership interest of our alliance partners in our consolidated results, obtained through the acquisition of First Data. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $17 million and $21 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net Income Per Share - DilutedNet income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted was $1.40, $1.71 and $2.87 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted in 2020 included integration costs and acquired intangible asset amortization from the application of purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of First Data, as well as gains from the sale of a 60% interest of our Investment Services business in February 2020 and the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture in July 2020. Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted in 2019 included transaction costs and financing activities associated with the acquisition of First Data, as well as integration costs and acquired asset amortization after the date of acquisition. Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted was favorably impacted in 2018 by a gain on the sale of a 55% interest of our Lending Solutions business. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralOur primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness, including finance leases; and (iii) fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $906 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $3.4 billion at December 31, 2020. The following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of First Data. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 included a payment of $183 million associated with the settlement of treasury lock agreements related to refinancing certain indebtedness assumed as part of the First Data acquisition.Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 6% and 7% of our total revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Share RepurchasesIn December 2020, New Omaha Holdings L.P. (""New Omaha""), a shareholder of ours, completed an underwritten secondary public offering of 20.1 million shares of our common stock (the “offering”). We repurchased from the underwriters 1.8 million shares of our common stock that were subject to the offering. The share repurchase totaled $200 million and was funded with cash on hand. The repurchased shares were cancelled and no longer outstanding following the completion of the share repurchase. In 2019, we deferred share repurchases as of January 16, 2019 until the close of the First Data acquisition. We purchased a total of $1.6 billion and $394 million of our common stock in 2020 and 2019, respectively.On November 19, 2020, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 60.0 million shares of our common stock. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 65.7 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorizations. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. Acquisitions and Dispositions AcquisitionsOn March 2, 2020, we acquired MerchantPro, an ISO that provides processing services, POS equipment and merchant cash advances to businesses across the United States. MerchantPro is included within the Acceptance segment and further expands our merchant services business. On March 18, 2020, we acquired Bypass, an ISO and innovator in enterprise POS systems for sports and entertainment venues, food service management providers and national restaurant chains. Bypass is included within the Acceptance segment and further enhances our omni-commerce capabilities, enabling enterprise businesses to deliver a seamless customer experience that spans physical and digital channels. On May 11, 2020, we acquired Inlet, a provider of secure digital delivery solutions for enterprise and middle-market billers’ invoices and statements. Inlet is included within the Payments segment and further enhances our digital bill payment strategy. We acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $167 million, net of $2 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $45 million. We funded these acquisitions by utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility.43Table of ContentsOn July 29, 2019, we acquired First Data for a total purchase price of $46.5 billion by acquiring 100% of the First Data stock that was issued and outstanding as of the date of acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, First Data stockholders received 286 million shares of common stock of Fiserv, Inc., at an exchange ratio of 0.303 shares of Fiserv, Inc. for each share of First Data common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. We also converted 15 million outstanding First Data equity awards into corresponding equity awards relating to common stock of Fiserv, Inc. in accordance with the exchange ratio. In addition, concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, we made a cash payment of $16.4 billion to repay existing First Data debt. We funded the transaction-related expenses and the repayment of First Data debt through a combination of available cash on-hand, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, and term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings. The acquisition of First Data, included within the Acceptance and Payments segments, increases our footprint as a global payments and financial technology provider by expanding the portfolio of services provided to financial institutions, corporate and merchant clients and consumers.On October 31, 2018, we acquired the debit card processing, ATM Managed Services, and MoneyPass® surcharge-free network of Elan Financial Services, a unit of U.S. Bancorp, for approximately $659 million including post-closing working capital adjustments, estimated contingent consideration related to earn-out provisions and future payments under a transition services agreement in excess of estimated fair value. This acquisition, included within the Payments segment, deepens our presence in debit card processing, broadens our client reach and scale and provides new solutions to enhance the value proposition for our existing debit solution clients.On January 22, 2021, we acquired Ondot Systems, Inc., a digital experience platform provider for financial institutions. This acquisition, to be included within the Payments segment, will further expand our digital capabilities, enhancing our suite of integrated solutions spanning card-based payments, digital banking platforms, core banking, and merchant solutions to enable clients of all sizes to deliver frictionless, digital-first and personalized experiences to their customers.DispositionsEffective July 1, 2020, we and BANA dissolved the BAMS joint venture, of which we maintained a 51% controlling ownership interest. Upon dissolution of the joint venture’s operations, the joint venture transferred a proportionate share of value, primarily the client contracts, to each party via an agreed upon contractual separation. The remaining activities of the joint venture will consist of supporting the transition of the business to each party and an orderly wind down of remaining BAMS assets and liabilities. The revenues and expenses of the BAMS joint venture were consolidated into our financial results through the date of dissolution. The business transferred to us will continue to be operated and managed within our Acceptance segment. We will continue to provide merchant processing and related services to former BAMS clients allocated to BANA, at BAMS pricing, through June 2023. We will also provide processing and other support services to new BANA merchant clients pursuant to a five-year non-exclusive agreement which, after June 2023, will also apply to the former BAMS clients allocated to BANA. In addition, both companies are entitled to certain transition services, at fair value, from each other through June 2023.On February 18, 2020, we sold a 60% controlling interest of our Investment Services business, subsequently renamed as Tegra118, LLC. We received pre-tax proceeds of $578 million, net of related expenses, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of $428 million, with a related tax expense of $112 million. The net proceeds from the sale were primarily used to repurchase shares of our common stock. On February 2, 2021, Tegra118 completed a merger with a third party, resulting in a dilution of our ownership interest in the combined new entity, Wealthtech Holdings, LLC. In connection with the acquisition of First Data, we acquired two businesses which we intended to sell. In October 2019, we completed the sales, at acquired fair value, of these two businesses for aggregate proceeds of $133 million. On March 29, 2018, we sold a 55% controlling interest of our Lending Solutions business, retaining 45% ownership interests in two joint ventures. We received gross sale proceeds of $419 million from the transactions. In August 2019, the Sagent Auto, LLC joint venture, formerly known as Fiserv Automotive Solutions, LLC, completed a merger with a third party, resulting in the dilution of our ownership interest to 31% in the combined entity, defi SOLUTIONS Group, LLC. The Lending Joint Ventures maintain variable-rate term loan facilities with aggregate outstanding borrowings of $385 million in senior unsecured debt and variable-rate revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $45 million with a syndicate of banks, which mature in March 2023. Outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2020 were $13 million. We have guaranteed this debt of the Lending Joint Ventures and do not anticipate that the Lending Joint Ventures will fail to fulfill their debt obligations. We maintain a liability for the estimated fair value of our non-contingent obligations to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee arrangements with the Lending Joint Ventures. Such guarantees will be amortized in future periods over the contractual term, based upon amounts to be received by us for the respective guarantees. In addition, we 44Table of Contentsmaintain a contingent liability representing the current expected credit losses to which we are exposed. This contingent liability is estimated based on certain financial metrics of the Lending Joint Ventures and historical industry data, which is used to develop assumptions of the likelihood the guaranteed parties will default and the level of credit losses in the event a default occurs. We have not made any payments under the guarantees, nor have we been called upon to do so. In addition, in January 2018, we completed the sale of the retail voucher business acquired in our 2017 acquisition of Monitise for proceeds of £37 million ($50 million).IndebtednessOur debt consisted of the following at December 31:(In millions)20202019Short-term and current maturities of long-term debt:Lines of credit$144 $150 Finance lease and other financing obligations240 137 Total short-term and current maturities of long-term debt$384 $287 Long-term debt:2.700% senior notes due June 2020$— $850 4.750% senior notes due June 2021400 400 3.500% senior notes due October 2022700 700 3.800% senior notes due October 20231,000 1,000 0.375% senior notes due July 2023 (Euro-denominated)612 559 2.750% senior notes due July 20242,000 2,000 3.850% senior notes due June 2025900 900 2.250% senior notes due July 2025 (British Pound-denominated)709 687 3.200% senior notes due July 20262,000 2,000 2.250% senior notes due June 20271,000 — 1.125% senior notes due July 2027 (Euro-denominated)612 559 4.200% senior notes due October 20281,000 1,000 3.500% senior notes due July 20293,000 3,000 2.650% senior notes due June 20301,000 — 1.625% senior notes due July 2030 (Euro-denominated)612 559 3.000% senior notes due July 2031 (British Pound-denominated)709 687 4.400% senior notes due July 20492,000 2,000 Receivable securitized loan425 500 Term loan facility1,250 3,950 Unamortized discount and deferred financing costs(155)(160)Revolving credit facility22 174 Finance lease and other financing obligations504 247 Total long-term debt$20,300 $21,612 At December 31, 2020, our debt consisted primarily of $18.3 billion of fixed rate senior notes and $1.3 billion of variable rate term loan. Interest on our U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes is paid semi-annually, while interest on our Euro- and British Pound-denominated senior notes is paid annually. Interest on our revolving credit facility is paid weekly, or more frequently on occasion, and interest on our term loans is paid monthly. Our 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021 were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility, which expires in September 2023.We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2020. Our ability to meet future debt covenant requirements will depend on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows. As described below, the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty as to general economic and market conditions. We expect to remain in compliance with all terms and conditions associated with our outstanding debt, including financial debt covenants.45Table of ContentsSenior NotesWe have outstanding $18.3 billion of various fixed-rate senior notes, as described above. The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. We may, at our option, redeem the senior notes, in whole or from time to time in part, at any time prior to the applicable maturity date. The interest rate applicable to certain of the senior notes is subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that the credit rating assigned to such notes is downgraded below investment grade.On May 13, 2020, we completed an offering of $2.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.25% senior notes due in June 2027 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.65% senior notes due in June 2030. The indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants that are substantially the same as those set forth in our senior notes described above. We used the net proceeds from these senior notes offerings to repay the outstanding principal balance of $850 million under our 2.7% senior notes due in June 2020 and outstanding borrowings under our amended and restated revolving credit facility totaling $1.1 billion.On June 24, 2019 and July 1, 2019, we completed various offerings of senior notes for the purpose of funding the repayment of certain indebtedness of First Data and its subsidiaries on the closing date of the acquisition.

On July 29, 2019, concurrent with the acquisition of First Data, we used the remaining net proceeds from the 2019 senior notes offerings described above, as well as the net proceeds of the term loan facility and a drawing on our revolving credit facility described below, to repay $16.4 billion of existing First Data debt and to pay fees and our expenses related to such repayment, the First Data acquisition and related transactions. In March 2019, we entered into treasury lock agreements (“Treasury Locks”), designated as cash flow hedges, in the aggregate notional amount of $5.0 billion to manage exposure to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. On June 24, 2019, concurrent with the issuance of the U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes described above, the Treasury Locks were settled resulting in a payment of $183 million that will be amortized to earnings over the terms of the originally forecasted interest payments.In June 2019, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize foreign currency exposure to the Euro and British Pound upon settlement of the proceeds from the foreign currency-denominated senior notes, as described above. The foreign exchange forward contracts matured on July 1, 2019, concurrent with the closing of the offering of the foreign currency-denominated senior notes. We realized foreign currency transaction gains of $3 million from these foreign exchange forward contracts. In addition, we held a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of these foreign currency-denominated senior notes in Euro- and British Pound-denominated cash and cash equivalents. We realized foreign currency transaction losses of $19 million as a result of changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Euro- and British Pound-denominated cash due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.In September 2018, we completed an offering of $2.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.8% senior notes due in October 2023 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.2% senior notes due in October 2028. We used the net proceeds from such offering to repay the outstanding principal balance of $540 million under our then-existing term loan and the then-outstanding borrowings under our amended and restated revolving credit facility totaling $1.1 billion. In addition, we commenced a cash tender offer in September 2018 for any and all of our then-outstanding $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due October 2020. Upon expiration of the tender offer on September 26, 2018, $246 million was tendered. In October 2018, we retired the remaining outstanding $204 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes. We recorded a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $14 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to these activities. 46Table of ContentsTerm Loan FacilityOn February 15, 2019, we entered into a term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions pursuant to which such financial institutions committed to provide us with a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate amount of $5.0 billion, consisting of $1.5 billion in commitments to provide loans with a term of three years and $3.5 billion in commitments to provide loans with a term of five years. On July 29, 2019, concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of First Data, the term loan credit agreement was funded. Loans drawn under the term loan facility are subject to amortization at a quarterly rate of 1.25% for the first eight quarters and 1.875% each quarter thereafter (with loans outstanding under the five-year tranche subject to amortization at a quarterly rate of 2.5% after the fourth anniversary of the commencement of amortization), with accrued and unpaid amortization amounts required to be paid on the last business day in December of each year. Borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus in each case, a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate on the term loan facility borrowings was 1.41% at December 31, 2020. The term loan credit facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default, that are substantially the same as those set forth in our existing amended revolving credit facility, as described below.Revolving Credit FacilityWe maintain an amended and restated revolving credit facility, which matures in September 2023, with aggregate commitments available for $3.5 billion of total capacity. Borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or a base rate, plus in each case a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings was 1.18% at December 31, 2020. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The amended and restated revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times our consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and expenses and certain other adjustments (“EBITDA”) during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions, and (ii) maintain EBITDA of at least three times our consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended. On February 6, 2019, we entered into an amendment to our amended and restated revolving credit facility to (i) amend the maximum leverage ratio covenant to permit us to elect to increase the permitted maximum leverage ratio from three and one-half times our consolidated EBITDA to either four times or four and one-half times our consolidated EBITDA for a specified period following certain acquisitions and (ii) permit us to make drawings under the revolving credit facility on the closing date of our acquisition of First Data subject to only limited conditions. In November 2019, we elected to increase the permitted maximum leverage ratio to four times our consolidated EBITDA pursuant to the terms of the amendment described above. Foreign Lines of Credit and Other ArrangementsWe maintain certain short-term lines of credit with foreign banks and alliance partners primarily to fund settlement activity. These arrangements are primarily associated with international operations and are in various functional currencies, the most significant of which are the Australian dollar, Polish zloty, Euro and Argentine peso. We had amounts outstanding on these lines of credit totaling $144 million and $150 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 21.98% and 13.42% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Receivable Securitized LoanWe maintain a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary, First Data Receivables, LLC (“FDR”). FDR is a party to certain receivables financing arrangements, including an agreement (“Receivables Financing Agreement”) with certain financial institutions and other persons from time to time party thereto as lenders and group agents, pursuant to which certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have agreed to transfer and contribute receivables to FDR, and FDR in turn may obtain borrowings from the financial institutions and other lender parties to the Receivables Financing Agreement secured by liens on those receivables. FDR’s assets are not available to satisfy the obligations of any other of our entities or affiliates, and FDR’s creditors would be entitled, upon its liquidation, to be satisfied out of FDR’s assets prior to any assets or value in FDR becoming available to us. FDR held $811 million and $773 million in receivables as part of the securitization program at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. FDR utilized the receivables as collateral in borrowings of $425 million and $500 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, at an average interest rate of 1.00% and 2.61%, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the collateral capacity under the Receivables Financing Agreement was $625 million, and the maximum borrowing capacity was $500 million. The term of the Receivables Financing Agreement is through July 2022. 47Table of ContentsOtherAccess to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rates payable on certain of our senior notes, our term loans and our revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates on the senior notes are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.Cash and Cash EquivalentsInvestments (other than those included in settlement assets) with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash are considered to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we held $906 million and $893 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively.The table below details the cash and cash equivalents at December 31:20202019(In millions)DomesticInternationalTotalDomesticInternationalTotalAvailable$337 $177 $514 $383 $208 $591 Unavailable (1)57 335 392 130 172 302 Total $394 $512 $906 $513 $380 $893 (1)Represents cash held primarily by our joint ventures that is not available to fund operations outside of those entities unless the board of directors for said entities declares a dividend, as well as cash held by certain other entities that are subject to foreign exchange controls in certain countries or regulatory capital requirements.Employee Termination CostsIn connection with the acquisition of First Data, we continue to implement integration plans focused on reducing our overall cost structure, including eliminating duplicate costs. We recorded $131 million and $32 million of employee termination costs related to severance and other separation costs for terminated employees in connection with the acquisition of First Data during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accrued employee severance and other separation costs of $27 million at December 31, 2020 are expected to be paid within the next twelve months. We continue to evaluate operating efficiencies and anticipate incurring additional costs in connection with these activities, but are unable to estimate those amounts at this time as such plans are not yet finalized.Impact of COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty as to general global economic and market conditions. We believe we have adequate capital resources and sufficient access to external financing sources to satisfy our current and reasonably anticipated requirements for funds to conduct our operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of our business. However, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. The ability to continue to service debt and meet lease and other obligations as they come due is dependent on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows. A lack of continued recovery or further deterioration in economic and market conditions could materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations.We engage in regular communication with the banks that participate in our revolving credit facility. During these communications, none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. We periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions, pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities, we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote. As evidenced by our May 2020 senior notes offering described above, the long-term debt markets have historically provided us with a source of liquidity. Although we do not currently 48Table of Contentsanticipate an inability to obtain financing from long-term debt markets in the future, effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could make financing more difficult and/or expensive to obtain. Our ability to access the long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms also depends on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services. In the event that the ratings of our outstanding long-term debt securities were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets could be adversely affected and our interest expense could increase under the terms of certain of our long-term debt securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing. The following table details our contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:(In millions)TotalLess than1 year1-3 years3-5 yearsMore than5 yearsLong-term debt including interest (1) (2)$25,957 $899 $4,470 $5,770 $14,818 Minimum finance lease payments (1)410 107 201 99 3 Minimum operating lease payments (1) (3)657 136 223 152 146 Purchase obligations (1) 1,889 608 787 328 166 Income tax obligations171 61 46 29 35 Total$29,084 $1,811 $5,727 $6,378 $15,168 (1)Interest, finance lease, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis.(2)The calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, no additional refinancing or lending occurs, except for our 4.75% notes due in June 2021 as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility maturing in September 2023, and the variable rate on the revolving credit facility and term loans are priced at the rate in effect at December 31, 2020. (3)Excludes $30 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for finance leases that have been signed but not yet commenced. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed to certain market risks, primarily from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our senior management actively monitors these risks.Interest Rate RiskIn addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities, we use a combination of fixed- and variable-rate debt instruments to finance our operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations. We had fixed- and variable-rate debt, excluding finance leases and other financing obligations, with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $18.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Our fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of fixed-rate senior notes with a fair value of $20.7 million, based on matrix pricing which considers readily observable inputs of comparable securities. The potential change in fair value of our fixed-rate senior notes from a hypothetical 1% change in market interest rates would not alone impact any decisions to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate debt instruments before their maturity. Our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility, variable rate term loan, foreign lines of credit and debt associated with the receivables securitization agreement. Based on our outstanding debt balances and interest rates at December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 1% increase in market interest rates related to our variable-rate debt would increase annual interest expense by approximately $18 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes the outstanding debt balances at December 31, 2020 and the change in market interest rates is applicable for an entire year. In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested into short-term, highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. Fluctuations in market interest rates affect the interest-related income that we earn on these investments. A hypothetical 1% decrease in market interest rates would decrease annual interest-related income related to settlement assets by approximately 49Table of Contents$30 million over the next twelve months. This sensitivity analysis assumes the subscriber fund balances at December 31, 2020 and the change in market interest rates is applicable for an entire year. Foreign Currency RiskWe conduct business globally and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar-denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We manage the exposure to these risks through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and non-derivative net investment hedges.Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arise from our non-U.S. operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency. Approximately 13% and 12% of our total revenue was generated outside the U.S in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the Euro, the British Pound, the Indian Rupee and the Argentine Peso. A strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which our revenue and profits are denominated by 10% would have resulted in a decrease or increase , respectively, in our reported pre-tax income as follows at December 31:(In millions) 20202019Euro$7 $7 British Pound3 4 Indian Rupee2 3 Argentine Peso3 2 Other5 9 Total increase or decrease$20 $25 We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency exposure to our operating costs in India. At December 31, 2020, the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately $259 million, with a positive fair value of $9 million. In addition, we designated our foreign currency-denominated senior notes as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to changes in the value of our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Refer to Item 1A in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of risks and potential risks of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.50Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:20:18.465252

As a result of the acquisition, First Data stockholders received 286 million shares of common stock of Fiserv, Inc., at an exchange ratio of 0.303 shares of Fiserv, Inc. for each share of First Data common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. We also converted 15 million outstanding First Data equity awards into corresponding equity awards relating to common stock of Fiserv, Inc. in accordance with the exchange ratio. In addition, concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, we made a cash payment of $16.4 billion to repay existing First Data debt. We 29Table of Contents funded the transaction-related expenses and the repayment of First Data debt through a combination of available cash on-hand, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, and term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings. The acquisition of First Data, included within the Acceptance and Payments segments, increases our footprint as a global payments and financial technology provider by expanding the portfolio of services provided to financial institutions, corporate and merchant clients and consumers.In February 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining ownership interest in Finxact, Inc. (“Finxact”), a developer of cloud-native banking solutions powering digital transformation throughout financial services, for approximately $650 million. We expect the acquisition to close in 2022, subject to customary approvals and closing conditions. Upon closing of the acquisition, Finxact will be included within the Fintech segment.

Upon dissolution of the joint venture’s operations, the joint venture transferred a proportionate share of value, primarily the client contracts, to each party via an agreed upon contractual separation. The transfer of value to BANA was accounted for at fair value, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $36 million, with a related tax expense of $13 million. The remaining activities of the joint venture consist primarily of an orderly wind down of remaining BAMS assets and liabilities. The revenues and expenses of the BAMS joint venture were consolidated into our financial results though the date of dissolution. The business transferred to us continues to be operated and managed within our Acceptance segment.We will continue to provide merchant processing and related services to former BAMS clients allocated to BANA, at BAMS pricing, through June 2023. We will also provide processing and other support services to new BANA merchant clients pursuant to a five-year non-exclusive agreement which, after June 2023, will also apply to the former BAMS clients allocated to BANA. In addition, both companies are entitled to certain transition services, at fair value, from each other through June 2023.On February 18, 2020, we sold a 60% controlling interest of our Investment Services business, subsequently renamed as Tegra118, LLC (“Tegra118”), which is reported within Corporate and Other. We received pre-tax proceeds of $578 million, net of related expenses, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of $428 million, with a related tax expense of $112 million. The revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Investment Services business were consolidated into our financial results through the date of the sale transaction, and is reported within Corporate and Other. On February 2, 2021, Tegra118 completed a merger with a third party, resulting in a dilution of our ownership interest in the combined new entity, Wealthtech Holdings, LLC, which was subsequently renamed as InvestCloud Holdings, LLC (“InvestCloud”). In connection with the transaction, we made an additional capital contribution of $200 million into the combined entity and recognized a pre-tax gain of $28 million, with a related tax expense of $6 million. On June 30, 2021, we sold our entire ownership interest in InvestCloud for $466 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $33 million, with a related tax expense of $8 million. We will continue to provide various technical and data center related services for defined periods under the terms of a pre-existing transition services agreement.Enterprise Priorities We aspire to move money and information in a way that moves the world by delivering superior value for our clients through leading technology, targeted innovation and excellence in everything we do. We achieve this through active portfolio management of our business, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our long-term priorities are to (i) continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; (iii) deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients; and (iv) deliver integration value from acquisitions.Industry TrendsThe global payments landscape continues to evolve, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, e-commerce and innovation in real-time payments infrastructure. Because of this growth, competition also continues to evolve. Business and consumer expectations continue to rise, with a focus on convenience and security. To meet these expectations, payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology, expanding the use of data and enhancing the customer experience.30Table of Contents MerchantsThe rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and e-commerce, driven by consumers’ desire for convenient and efficient shopping experiences, has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers in high-growth online and mobile settings, which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments. Merchants are demanding simple, integrated and modern POS systems to help manage their everyday business operations. When combined with the ever-increasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services, merchants have sought modern POS systems to streamline this complexity. Furthermore, merchants can now search, discover, compare, purchase and even install a new POS system through direct, digital-only experiences. This direct, digital-only channel is quickly becoming a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities, especially with respect to smaller merchants. In addition, there are numerous software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions in the industry, many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring within their software as a way to further monetize their client relationships. SaaS solutions that integrate payments are often referred to as ISVs, and we believe there are thousands of these potential distribution partnership opportunities available to us. We believe that our merchant acquiring products and solutions create compelling value propositions for merchant clients of all sizes, from small and mid-sized businesses (or “SMBs”) to medium-sized regional businesses to global enterprise merchants, and across all verticals. Furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with valued partnerships with merchant acquiring businesses of small, medium and large financial institutions, and non-financial institutions, gives us a solid foundation for growth.Financial InstitutionsFinancial service providers regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, risk management, lending and investment products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. These conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include electronic payments and delivery methods such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as “digital channels,” which enable financial institutions to offer their customers an industry-leading digital banking experience.The focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. We expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including a unified, seamless customer experience across mobile and online channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. In addition to the trends described above, during the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. If a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition, we typically receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. These fees can vary from period to period with the variance depending on the quantum of financial institution merger activity in a given period and whether or not our clients are involved in the activity. Our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. Furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth.31Table of Contents Recent Market ConditionsSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic, and various measures imposed by the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions to prevent its spread, have, among other matters, negatively impacted consumer and business spending and, as a result, our operating performance, primarily within our merchant acquiring and payment-related businesses, which earn transaction-based fees.We experienced a significant decrease in payments volume and transactions beginning in late March 2020 that negatively impacted our merchant acquiring and payment-related businesses as well as modest declines in other businesses. Merchant acquiring transaction and payment volumes began to partially recover throughout the remainder of 2020 and have continued to grow throughout 2021. Accordingly, our merchant acquiring and payment-related businesses were less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2021 than they were throughout most of fiscal 2020. While this current business trend is positive, the extent of the adverse impact of the pandemic on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition will depend on, among other matters, the duration and intensity of the pandemic; the level of success of global vaccination efforts; governmental and private sector responses to the pandemic and the impact of such responses on us; and the impact of the pandemic on our employees, clients, vendors, supply chain, operations and sales, all of which are uncertain, difficult to predict and may remain prevalent for a significant period of time even after the pandemic subsides, including due to a continued or prolonged recession in the U.S. or other major economies.In 2021, we began observing increasing shortages and delays in the global supply chain for components and inputs necessary to our businesses, such as semiconductors, paper and plastic, and may experience difficulty procuring those components and inputs in the future on a timely basis or at historical prices.The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused us to modify our business practices, including restricting travel, limiting non-essential visitors to our facilities, disinfecting facilities, providing onsite testing and personal protective equipment to employees, establishing a variety of safety protocols at facilities, and requiring U.S. employees to be fully vaccinated unless they have an approved medical, religious, or state exemption.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates.AcquisitionsFrom time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. The determination of fair value requires estimates about discount rates, growth and retention rates, royalty rates, expected future cash flows and other future events that are judgmental in nature. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Additional information regarding our acquisitions is included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.Goodwill and Intangible Assets We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is one level below our 32Table of Contents reportable segments. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the prior test’s amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test.The quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using both a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent annual impairment assessment of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2021 determined that our goodwill of $36.4 billion was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units exceeded the carrying values. However, for three of our reporting units that were acquired as part of the First Data acquisition, with aggregate goodwill of $11.1 billion, the excess of the respective reporting unit’s fair value over carrying value ranged from 8 to 21 percent. If future operating performance is below our expectations or there are changes to forecasted revenue growth rates, risk-adjusted discount rates, effective income tax rates, merchant alliance agreements or some combination thereof, a decline in the fair value of the reporting units could result in, and we may be required to record, a goodwill impairment charge. It is also reasonably possible that future developments related to the interest rate environment or the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our recently acquired (recorded at fair value) First Data businesses, such as an increased duration and intensity of the pandemic and/or government-imposed restrictions, could have a future material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment. We have no accumulated goodwill impairment through December 31, 2021. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We review capitalized software development costs for impairment at each reporting date. Recoverability of intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to either the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or the net realizable value of the asset, depending on the type of asset. Determining future cash flows and net realizable values involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future economic and market conditions. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. As a practical expedient, we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. Contracts with customers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue is generated from account- and transaction-based fees for data processing, merchant transaction processing and acquiring, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds transfer and debit/credit processing services; consulting and professional services; and software maintenance for ongoing client support.We recognize processing and services revenues in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services, in which case revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services. Our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when- and if-needed basis (a stand-ready obligation) and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer. These services are typically provided under a fixed or declining (tier-based) price per unit based on volume of service; however, pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees. Fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis.33Table of Contents ProductProduct revenue is generated from print and card production sales, as well as software license and hardware (POS devices) sales. For software license agreements that are distinct, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery, assuming a contract is deemed to exist. Revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization, modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended, such as labor hours, to measure progress towards completion. For arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer, a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software. We sell or lease hardware (POS devices) and other peripherals as part of our contracts with customers. Hardware typically consists of terminals or Clover devices. We do not manufacture hardware, rather we purchase hardware from third-party vendors and hold such hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer. We account for sales of hardware as a separate performance obligation and recognize the revenue at its standalone selling price when the customer obtains control of the hardware.Significant JudgmentsWe use the following methods, inputs and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize. For multi-element arrangements, we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement, and if a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.Technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings. Whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers to determine whether we obtain control of goods and services prior to their transfer to a customer.The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. We include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price. To the extent that variable consideration is not constrained, we include an estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract. We may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted. The transaction price (including any discounts or rebates) is allocated between distinct goods and services in a multi-element arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines. Significant judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service.Contract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price (or both) of the contract or when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by us. When a contract modification occurs, it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as (i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract. Further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract, including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation.Additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires management’s judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, sometimes made more complex by our global footprint. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish a liability for known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. In establishing a liability for known tax exposures, assumptions are made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position will be sustained. A tax benefit with respect to a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits, considering the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. The amount of tax benefit recognized reflects the largest benefit that we 34Table of Contents believe is more likely than not to be realized on settlement with the relevant taxing authority. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our liability for known tax exposures as appropriate.We maintain net operating loss carryforwards in various taxing jurisdictions, resulting in the establishment of deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, based upon the weight of all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we have considered the relative impact of all of the available positive and negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income and available tax planning strategies. However, there could be a material impact to our effective tax rate if there is a significant change in our judgment. To the extent our judgment changes, the valuation allowances are then adjusted, generally through the provision for income taxes, in the period in which the change in facts and circumstances occurs. Additional information regarding our income taxes is included in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.Results of OperationsComponents of Revenue and ExpensesThe following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue, which in 2021 represented 82% of our total revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; certain depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses.ProductProduct revenue, which in 2021 represented 18% of our total revenue, is primarily derived from print and card production sales, as well as software license and hardware (primarily POS devices) sales. Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials, postage and software development; hardware costs (primarily POS devices); personnel; infrastructure costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; third-party commissions; advertising and promotional costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses.Synergies from the First Data Acquisition Following the acquisition of First Data, we have continued to implement our post-merger integration plans to achieve synergies and future expected economic benefits, including enhanced revenue growth from expanded capabilities and geographic presence as well as substantial cost savings from the elimination of duplicative overhead and enhanced operational efficiency. As of December 31, 2021, we have achieved 80% of our $600 million revenue synergy target and expect to attain the remaining revenue synergies by the end of 2022. In addition, we have completed the integration activities associated with the achievement of cost synergies, having actioned $1.2 billion in cost synergies as of December 31, 2021, and we expect to incur lower acquisition and integration related costs in 2022.35Table of Contents Financial ResultsThe following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This section discusses fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020. Discussions of fiscal year 2020 compared to 2019 can be found in Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2021.

Operating margin percentages are calculated using actual, unrounded amounts.Total RevenueTotal revenue increased $1,374 million, or 9%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue increase was primarily due to improved payment and transaction volumes across all of our business segments, partially offset by the loss of revenue attributable to dispositions that had revenue of $155 million in 2020. In addition, the revenue in our merchant acquiring and payment-related businesses were more adversely affected by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 than during 2021. Revenue in our Acceptance segment increased $957 million, or 17%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue increase was primarily due to growth from improved merchant acquiring payment and transaction volumes, partially offset by a reduction in revenue of 2% from the July 2020 dissolution of the BAMS joint venture. Revenue in our Fintech segment increased $121 million, or 4%, in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by recurring revenue growth from higher processing revenue across our Fintech businesses.Revenue in our Payments segment increased $329 million, or 6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. Payments segment revenue growth was driven by revenue contributions of 3% from our debit processing business primarily attributable to increased transaction volumes and favorable pricing. Increased volumes also drove favorable revenue growth across our remaining Payments segment businesses, other than in our bill payment business which partially offset revenue growth by 1% in 2021.Revenue at Corporate and Other decreased $33 million, or 4%, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the disposition of a 60% controlling interest of our Investment Services business. Total Expenses Total expenses increased $938 million, or 7%, in 2021 compared to 2020. Total expenses in 2020 included a 3% benefit from gains on sale of businesses. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased by 160 basis points to 85.9% in 2021 compared to 2020. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2021 decreased primarily as a result of operating efficiencies and cost savings from First Data acquisition-related cost synergies.37Table of Contents Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 45.7% in 2021 compared to 47.8% in 2020. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in 2021 due primarily to strong operating leverage, including cost synergies, across our businesses, partially offset by increased acquisition and integration related expenses of approximately 80 basis points in 2021 as compared to 2020.Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 70.0% in 2021 compared to 74.7% in 2020. The cost of product as a percentage of product revenue improved in 2021 as a result of revenue mix.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 35.8% in 2021 compared to 38.1% in 2020. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2021 was primarily due to strong operating leverage and operating efficiencies across our businesses, along with approximately 90 basis points from decreased acquisition and integration related expenses and approximately 20 basis points from lower employee termination costs in 2021.The gains on sale of businesses in 2020 resulted from a gain of $428 million on the sale of a 60% interest of our Investment Services business in February 2020 and a gain of $36 million on the dissolution of BAMS in July 2020.Operating Income and Operating Margin Total operating income increased $436 million, or 24%, in 2021 compared to 2020. Total operating margin increased 160 basis points to 14.1% in 2021 compared to 2020. Total operating income and total operating margin benefited from improved operating leverage accompanying scalable revenue growth in 2021, as well as from operating efficiencies as noted above. Total operating income and total operating margin were also impacted by a $428 million gain on the sale of a 60% interest of our Investment Services business in February 2020 and a $36 million gain on the dissolution of BAMS in July 2020.Operating income in our Acceptance segment increased $569 million, or 40%, in 2021 compared to 2020. Operating margin increased 490 basis points to 30.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. Operating margin growth in 2021 was primarily due to revenue growth as noted above.Operating income in our Fintech segment increased $89 million, or 9%, in 2021 compared to 2020. Operating margin increased 160 basis points to 35.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. Operating margin improvement in 2021 was driven by scalable revenue growth discussed above, along with expense management initiatives across the segment, including lower personnel costs of approximately 60 basis points.Operating income in our Payments segment increased $196 million, or 8%, in 2021 compared to 2020. Operating margin increased 90 basis points to 43.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. Operating margin growth in 2021 was primarily attributable to operating efficiencies and cost synergies.The operating loss in Corporate and Other increased $418 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Corporate and Other was favorably impacted in the prior year by a $428 million gain on the sale of a 60% interest of our Investment Services business in February 2020 and a $36 million gain on the dissolution of BAMS in July 2020.Interest Expense, NetInterest expense, net decreased $16 million, or 2%, in 2021 compared to 2020 due to lower effective interest rates on outstanding borrowings.Other IncomeOther income increased $43 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Other income includes net foreign currency transaction gains and losses, gains or losses from a change in fair value of investments in certain equity securities, and amounts related to debt guarantee arrangements of certain joint ventures. Net foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were $12 million and ($20) million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Other income in 2021 includes $12 million related to a pre-tax gain on the remeasurement of a previously held investment in Ondot to fair value upon acquiring the remaining ownership interest in the entity and $20 million related to a gain on sale of investments in certain equity securities. Other income in 2020 includes $19 million related to a pre-tax gain on the sale of certain lease receivables.38Table of Contents Income Tax ProvisionIncome tax provision as a percentage of income before income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was 21.8% and 16.7% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily the result of $134 million of income tax expense attributed to the revaluation of certain net deferred tax liabilities in connection with corporate income tax rate changes enacted in 2021 in the United Kingdom (tax rate increased from 19% to 25% starting in 2023) and Argentina (tax rate increased from 25% to 35%).Income from Investments in Unconsolidated AffiliatesOur share of net income from affiliates accounted for using the equity method of accounting is reported as income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates and the related tax expense is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $100 million and $0 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was favorably impacted by improved operating results within the unconsolidated affiliates in 2021. Additionally, income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2021 included a $33 million pre-tax gain resulting from the sale of our remaining ownership interest in InvestCloud and a $28 million pre-tax gain resulting from the dilution of our ownership interest in connection with the Tegra118 merger with a third party.Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests relates to the minority partners’ share of the net income in our consolidated subsidiaries. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $69 million and $17 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to improved operating results within the consolidated subsidiaries.Net Income Per Share - DilutedNet income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted was $1.99 and $1.40 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted increased in 2021 primarily as a result of the improved operating results discussed above. Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted in 2020 included a gain from the sale of a 60% interest of our Investment Services business and a gain on the dissolution of BAMS.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralOur primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness, including finance leases; and (iii) fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied in both the short term and the long term using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $835 million, proceeds from the issuance of U.S. and Euro commercial paper notes, and available capacity under our revolving credit facility of $1.6 billion (net of outstanding balance and $1.8 billion of capacity designated for outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper notes programs) at December 31, 2021. The following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

This decrease was primarily attributable to higher working capital use compared to the prior year, including increased accounts receivable corresponding to revenue growth, and higher income tax payments following consumption of certain federal net operating loss carryforwards, partially offset by improved operating results. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow to primarily fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 7% and 6% of our total revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Share RepurchasesWe purchased a total of $2.6 billion and $1.6 billion of our common stock in 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 42.3 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorizations. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. 39Table of Contents Acquisitions and Dispositions AcquisitionsIn November 2021 we acquired BentoBox, in October 2021 we acquired AIP, in June 2021 we acquired SpendLabs, in May 2021 we acquired Pineapple Payments, and in March 2021 we acquired Radius8. Additionally, in November 2021, we acquired a remaining ownership interest in NetPay, and in January 2021, we acquired a remaining ownership interest in Ondot, in which we previously held noncontrolling equity interests. We acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $882 million, net of $43 million of acquired cash and the fair value of our previously held equity interests of $36 million, and including earn-out provisions estimated at an aggregate fair value of $34 million. We funded these acquisitions by utilizing a combination of available cash, commercial paper notes and existing availability under our revolving credit facility. The results of operations for these acquired businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition.In May 2020, we acquired Inlet and, in March 2020, we acquired MerchantPro and Bypass. We acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $167 million, net of $2 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $45 million. We funded these acquisitions by utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility. The results of operations for these acquired businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition.On July 29, 2019, we acquired First Data for a total purchase price of $46.5 billion by acquiring 100% of the First Data stock that was issued and outstanding as of the date of acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, First Data stockholders received 286 million shares of common stock of Fiserv, Inc., at an exchange ratio of 0.303 shares of Fiserv, Inc. for each share of First Data common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. We also converted 15 million outstanding First Data equity awards into corresponding equity awards relating to common stock of Fiserv, Inc. in accordance with the exchange ratio. In addition, concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, we made a cash payment of $16.4 billion to repay existing First Data debt. We funded the transaction-related expenses and the repayment of First Data debt through a combination of available cash on-hand, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, and term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings. In February 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining ownership interest in Finxact for approximately $650 million, which we expect to close later in 2022, subject to customary approvals and closing conditions. We plan to fund this acquisition by utilizing a combination of available cash and available borrowing capacity.DispositionsEffective July 1, 2020, we and BANA dissolved the BAMS joint venture, of which we maintained a 51% controlling ownership interest. Upon dissolution of the joint venture’s operations, the joint venture transferred a proportionate share of value, primarily the client contracts, to each party via an agreed upon contractual separation. The remaining activities of the joint venture consist primarily of an orderly wind down of remaining BAMS assets and liabilities. The revenues and expenses of the BAMS joint venture were consolidated into our financial results through the date of dissolution. The business transferred to us is included within our Acceptance segment. We continue to provide merchant processing and related services to former BAMS clients allocated to BANA, at BAMS pricing, through June 2023. We will also provide processing and other support services to new BANA merchant clients pursuant to a five-year non-exclusive agreement which, after June 2023, will also apply to the former BAMS clients allocated to BANA. In addition, both companies are entitled to certain transition services, at fair value, from each other through June 2023.In February 2020, we sold a 60% controlling interest of our Investment Services business, subsequently renamed as Tegra118. We received pre-tax proceeds of $578 million, net of related expenses, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of $428 million, with the related tax expense of $112 million. The revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Investment Services business were consolidated into our financial results through the date of the sale transaction. The net proceeds from the sale were primarily used to repurchase shares of our common stock. In February 2021, Tegra118 completed a merger with a third party, resulting in a dilution of our ownership interest in the combined new entity, Wealthtech Holdings, LLC, which was subsequently renamed as InvestCloud. In connection with the transaction, we made an additional capital contribution, funded under our revolving credit facility, of $200 million into the combined entity and recognized a pre-tax gain of $28 million, with a related tax expense of $6 million. In June 2021, we sold our entire ownership interest in InvestCloud for $466 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $33 million, with a related tax expense of $8 million. The net proceeds from the sale were primarily used to pay down outstanding borrowings on our term loan facility.We maintain a 45% ownership interest in Sagent M&C, LLC and a 31% ownership interest in defi SOLUTIONS Group, LLC (collectively, the “Lending Joint Ventures”). The Lending Joint Ventures maintain variable-rate term loan facilities with aggregate outstanding borrowings of $365 million in senior unsecured debt and variable-rate revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $45 million with a syndicate of banks, which mature in March 2023. Outstanding borrowings 40Table of Contents on the revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2021 were $16 million. We have guaranteed this debt of the Lending Joint Ventures and do not anticipate that the Lending Joint Ventures will fail to fulfill their debt obligations. We maintain a liability for the estimated fair value of our non-contingent obligations to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee arrangements. Such guarantees will be amortized in future periods over the contractual term, based upon amounts to be received by us for the respective guarantees. In addition, we maintain a contingent liability representing the current expected credit losses to which we are exposed. This contingent liability is estimated based on certain financial metrics of the Lending Joint Ventures and historical industry data, which is used to develop assumptions of the likelihood the guaranteed parties will default and the level of credit losses in the event a default occurs. We have not made any payments under the guarantees, nor have we been called upon to do so. IndebtednessOur debt consisted of the following at December 31:(In millions)20212020Short-term and current maturities of long-term debt:Foreign lines of credit$240 $144 Finance lease and other financing obligations268 240 Total short-term and current maturities of long-term debt$508 $384 Long-term debt:4.750% senior notes due June 2021$— $400 3.500% senior notes due October 2022700 700 0.375% senior notes due July 2023 (Euro-denominated)566 612 3.800% senior notes due October 20231,000 1,000 2.750% senior notes due July 20242,000 2,000 3.850% senior notes due June 2025900 900 2.250% senior notes due July 2025 (British Pound-denominated)705 709 3.200% senior notes due July 20262,000 2,000 2.250% senior notes due June 20271,000 1,000 1.125% senior notes due July 2027 (Euro-denominated)566 612 4.200% senior notes due October 20281,000 1,000 3.500% senior notes due July 20293,000 3,000 2.650% senior notes due June 20301,000 1,000 1.625% senior notes due July 2030 (Euro-denominated)566 612 3.000% senior notes due July 2031 (British Pound-denominated)705 709 4.400% senior notes due July 20492,000 2,000 U.S. commercial paper notes916 — Euro commercial paper notes905 — Revolving credit facility97 22 Receivable securitized loan500 425 Term loan facility200 1,250 Unamortized discount and deferred financing costs(125)(155)Finance lease and other financing obligations528 504 Total long-term debt$20,729 $20,300 At December 31, 2021, our debt consisted primarily of $17.7 billion of fixed rate senior notes, $1.8 billion of outstanding borrowings under our U.S. and Euro commercial paper notes programs and $500 million under our receivables securitized loan. Interest on our U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes is paid semi-annually, while interest on our Euro- and British Pound-denominated senior notes is paid annually. Interest on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper notes is paid weekly, or more frequently on occasion, and interest on our term loans is paid monthly. Outstanding borrowings under our 3.50% senior notes due in October 2022, the receivable securitized loan which matures in July 2022, and U.S and Euro commercial paper notes programs are classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as we have the intent to refinance these notes on a 41Table of Contents long-term basis through the continued issuance of new commercial paper notes upon maturity, and we also have the ability to refinance such notes under our revolving credit facility, which expires in September 2023. Our 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021 were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term at December 31, 2020, as we had the intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis. These notes were subsequently refinanced in June 2021 through the issuance of U.S. commercial paper notes and proceeds obtained from the sale of our remaining ownership interest in InvestCloud.We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2021. Our ability to meet future debt covenant requirements will depend on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows. We expect to remain in compliance with all terms and conditions associated with our outstanding debt, including financial debt covenants.Senior NotesWe have outstanding $17.7 billion of various fixed-rate senior notes, as described above. The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. We may, at our option, redeem the senior notes, in whole or from time to time in part, at any time prior to the applicable maturity date. The interest rate applicable to certain of the senior notes is subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that the credit rating assigned to such notes is downgraded below investment grade.Commercial PaperWe initiated an unsecured U.S. dollar commercial paper program in May 2021 and an unsecured Euro commercial paper program in November 2021. From time to time, we may issue under these programs U.S. dollar commercial paper with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance and Euro commercial paper with maturities of up to 183 days from the date of issuance. We use the proceeds of commercial paper issued under these programs to pay down other outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. Outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper programs bear interest at a fixed rate based on the prevailing rates at the time of issuance of the relevant commercial paper. Outstanding borrowings under the U.S. dollar program were $916 million at December 31, 2021, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.295%. Outstanding borrowings under the Euro program were $905 million at December 31, 2021, with a weighted average interest rate of (0.420)%, with maturities generally ranging from one day to four months. We intend to maintain available capacity under our revolving credit facility in an amount at least equal to the outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs.Revolving Credit FacilityWe maintain an amended and restated revolving credit facility, which matures in September 2023, with aggregate commitments available for $3.5 billion of total capacity. U.S. dollar borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, typically at the overnight or 1-month rates, or a base rate, plus, in each case, a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. Foreign currency borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on a benchmark applicable to the relevant currency, plus, in each case, a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings was 1.16% at December 31, 2021. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The amended and restated revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times our consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and expenses and certain other adjustments (“EBITDA”) during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions, and (ii) maintain EBITDA of at least three times our consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended. Foreign Lines of Credit and Other ArrangementsWe maintain certain short-term lines of credit with foreign banks and alliance partners primarily to fund settlement activity. These arrangements are primarily associated with international operations and are in various functional currencies, the most significant of which is the Argentine peso. We had amounts outstanding on these lines of credit totaling $240 million and $144 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 21.01% and 21.98% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Receivable Securitized LoanWe maintain a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary, First Data Receivables, LLC (“FDR”). FDR is a party to certain receivables financing arrangements, including an agreement (“Receivables Financing Agreement”) with certain financial 42Table of Contents institutions and other persons from time to time party thereto as lenders and group agents, pursuant to which certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have agreed to transfer and contribute receivables to FDR, and FDR in turn may obtain borrowings from the financial institutions and other lender parties to the Receivables Financing Agreement secured by liens on those receivables. FDR’s assets are not available to satisfy the obligations of any other of our entities or affiliates, and FDR’s creditors would be entitled, upon its liquidation, to be satisfied out of FDR’s assets prior to any assets or value in FDR becoming available to us. FDR held $1.0 billion and $811 million in receivables as part of the securitization program at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. FDR utilized the receivables as collateral in borrowings of $500 million and $425 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, at an average interest rate of 0.95% and 1.00%, respectively. Outstanding borrowings bear interest at a variable rate based on one-month LIBOR plus a specified margin. At December 31, 2021, the collateral capacity under the Receivables Financing Agreement was $747 million, and the maximum borrowing capacity was $500 million. The term of the Receivables Financing Agreement is through July 2022.Term Loan FacilityWe maintain a term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that was funded in conjunction with the acquisition of First Data in an original principal amount of $5.0 billion. Following various amortization payments and prepayments, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under such agreement was $200 million at December 31, 2021. Borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest at variable rates based on one-month LIBOR or on a base rate, plus, in each case, a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time, and will mature in July 2024. The variable interest rate on the term loan facility borrowings was 1.35% at December 31, 2021. A portion of the net proceeds from our 2021 issuances of commercial paper, as described above, was used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility. The term loan credit facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default, that are substantially the same as those set forth in our existing amended and restated revolving credit facility, as described above.OtherAccess to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. As of December 31, 2021, we had a commercial paper credit rating of P-2 from Moody’s and A-2 from S&P.The interest rates payable on certain of our senior notes, our term loan, commercial paper notes programs and our revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates on the senior notes are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.Cash and Cash EquivalentsInvestments, exclusive of settlement assets, with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash are considered to be cash equivalents as reflected within our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we held $835 million and $906 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively.The table below details the cash and cash equivalents at December 31:20212020(In millions)DomesticInternationalTotalDomesticInternationalTotalAvailable$180 $221 $401 $337 $177 $514 Unavailable (1)138 296 434 57 335 392 Total $318 $517 $835 $394 $512 $906 (1)Represents cash held by our joint ventures that is not available to fund operations outside of those entities unless the board of directors for such entities declares a dividend, as well as cash held by certain other entities that are subject to foreign exchange controls in certain countries or regulatory capital requirements.43Table of Contents Employee Termination CostsIn connection with the acquisition of First Data, we implemented integration plans focused on reducing our overall cost structure, including eliminating duplicate costs. We recorded $95 million and $131 million of employee termination costs related to severance and other separation costs for terminated employees, including those in connection with the acquisition of First Data, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Accrued employee severance and other separation costs of $36 million at December 31, 2021 are expected to be paid within the next twelve months.Impact of COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty as to general global economic and market conditions. We believe we have adequate capital resources and sufficient access to external financing sources to satisfy our current and reasonably anticipated requirements for funds to conduct our operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of our business. However, as the impact of the pandemic on the economy and our operations further evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. The ability to continue to service debt and meet lease and other obligations as they come due depends on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows. A lack of continued recovery or further deterioration in economic and market conditions could materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations.We engage in regular communication with the banks that participate in our revolving credit facility. During these communications, none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. We periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions, pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities, we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote. We maintain U.S. and Euro commercial paper notes programs to access funding for general corporate purposes at favorable rates and to provide a source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2021, we had a commercial paper credit rating of P-2 from Moody’s and A-2 from S&P. Any downgrade to our commercial paper credit ratings or instability in the commercial paper markets may adversely impact our ability to access funding through our commercial paper notes programs and require us to rely more heavily on more expensive financing arrangements, including our revolving credit facility. In addition, the long-term debt markets have historically provided us with a source of liquidity. Although we do not currently anticipate an inability to obtain financing from long-term debt markets in the future, effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could make financing more difficult and/or expensive to obtain. Our ability to access the long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms also depends on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s and BBB with a stable outlook from S&P. In the event that the ratings of our outstanding long-term debt securities were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets could be adversely affected and our interest expense could increase under the terms of certain of our long-term debt securities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed to certain market risks, primarily from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our senior management actively monitors these risks.Interest Rate RiskIn addition to existing cash and cash equivalents balances and cash provided by operating activities, we use a combination of fixed- and variable-rate debt instruments to finance our operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations. We had fixed- and variable-rate debt, excluding finance leases and other financing obligations, with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $17.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021. Our fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2021 primarily consisted of fixed-rate senior notes with a fair value of $18.9 billion, based on matrix pricing which considers readily observable inputs of comparable securities. The potential change in fair value of our fixed-rate senior notes from a hypothetical 1% change in market interest rates would not alone impact any decisions to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate debt instruments before their maturity. Our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2021 primarily consisted of outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility, U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper, variable rate term loan, foreign lines of credit and debt associated with the receivables securitization agreement. Based on our outstanding debt balances and interest rates at December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 1% increase in market interest rates related to our variable-rate debt would increase annual interest expense by approximately $29 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes the outstanding debt balances at December 31, 2021 and the change in market interest rates is applicable for an entire year. 44Table of Contents In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, we receive settlement funds that are invested into short-term, highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. Fluctuations in market interest rates affect the interest-related income that we earn on these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the amount of such interest-related income was not material and, therefore, a hypothetical 1% decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on such income. This sensitivity analysis assumes the subscriber fund balances at December 31, 2021 and the change in market interest rates is applicable for an entire year.Foreign Currency RiskWe conduct business globally and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar-denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We manage the exposure to these risks through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and non-derivative net investment hedges.Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arise from our non-U.S. operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency. Approximately 14% and 13% of our total revenue was generated outside the U.S in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro and Indian Rupee. A strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which our revenue and profits are denominated by 10% would have resulted in a decrease or increase, respectively, in our reported pre-tax income as follows at December 31:(In millions) 20212020Argentine Peso$4 $3 Brazilian Real6 4 British Pound5 3 Canadian Dollar4 1 Euro16 7 Indian Rupee3 2 Other1 4 Total increase or decrease$39 $24 We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency exposure to our operating costs in India. At December 31, 2021, the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately $341 million, with a positive fair value of $6 million. In addition, we designated our foreign currency-denominated senior notes and Euro commercial paper notes as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to changes in the value of our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Refer to Item 1A in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of risks and potential risks of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.45Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:20:09.342934

We serve clients around the globe, including merchants, banks, credit unions, other financial institutions and corporate clients. We provide account processing and digital banking solutions; card issuer processing and network services; payments; e-commerce; merchant acquiring and processing; and the Clover® cloud-based point-of-sale (“POS”) and business management platform. Our operations are comprised of the Merchant Acceptance (“Acceptance”) segment, the Financial Technology (“Fintech”) segment and the Payments and Network (“Payments”) segment.The businesses in our Acceptance segment provide a wide range of commerce-enabling solutions and serve merchants of all sizes around the world. These solutions include POS merchant acquiring and digital commerce services; mobile payment services; security and fraud protection products; Clover, our cloud-based POS and integrated commerce operating system for small and mid-sized businesses (“SMBs”) and independent software vendors (“ISVs”); and CaratSM, our integrated operating system for large businesses. We distribute the products and services in the Acceptance segment businesses through a variety of channels, including direct sales teams, strategic partnerships with agent sales forces, ISVs, financial institutions, and other strategic partners in the form of joint venture alliances, revenue sharing alliances, and referral agreements. Merchants, financial institutions and distribution partners in the Acceptance segment are frequently clients of our other segments. The businesses in our Fintech segment provide financial institutions around the world with technology solutions they need to run their operations, including products and services that enable financial institutions to process customer deposit and loan accounts and manage an institution’s general ledger and central information files. As a complement to the core account processing functionality, the Fintech segment businesses also provide digital banking, financial and risk management, professional services and consulting, item processing and source capture, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Certain of the businesses in the Fintech segment provide products or services to corporate clients to facilitate the management of financial processes and transactions. Many of the products and services offered in the Fintech segment are integrated with products and services provided by our other segments.The businesses in the Payments segment provide financial institutions, corporate clients and the public sector with the products and services required to process digital payment transactions. This includes card transactions such as debit, credit and prepaid card processing and services; a range of network services, security and fraud protection products; and card production and print services. In addition, the Payments segment businesses offer non-card digital payment software and services, including bill payment, account-to-account transfers, person-to-person payments, electronic billing, and security and fraud protection products. Clients of the Payments segment businesses reflect a wide range of industries around the world, including merchants, distribution partners and financial institution customers in our other segments. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts that generally have high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide within our segments are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature.Corporate and Other supports the reportable segments described above, and consists of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, unallocated corporate expenses and other activities that are not considered when we evaluate segment performance, such as gains or losses on sales of businesses, certain assets or investments; costs associated with acquisition and divestiture activity; certain services revenue associated with various dispositions; and our Output Solutions postage reimbursements. 25Table of Contents Acquisitions and DispositionsWe frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the necessary business assets to execute our strategy. We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; an opportunity to change industry dynamics; a way to achieve business scale that enables competition and operational efficiency; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies. The results of operations for the following acquired and divested businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition and through the respective dates of disposition.AcquisitionsOn December 29, 2022, we acquired OrangeData S.A.

Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A. and SIS were reported primarily within our Fintech segment. On September 30, 2022, we sold our Korea operations, which were reported within our Acceptance segment. We sold these operations for total consideration of $99 million and recognized an aggregate net pre-tax loss on the sales of $83 million. These divestitures were the result of a strategic review of our business portfolio.We mutually agreed with a minority partner to terminate one of our merchant alliance joint ventures effective March 2022. In conjunction with such termination, the joint venture minority partner elected to exercise its option to purchase certain merchant contracts of the joint venture for $175 million, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $137 million. 26Table of Contents Enterprise PrioritiesWe aspire to move money and information in a way that moves the world. Our purpose is to deliver superior value for our clients through leading technology, targeted innovation and excellence in everything we do. We are focused on driving growth and creating value by assembling a high-performing and diverse team, integrating our solutions, delivering operational excellence, allocating capital in a disciplined manner, including share repurchase and merger and acquisition activity, and delivering breakthrough innovation. Our long-term priorities are to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our financial commitments; deepen client relationships with an emphasis on digital channels and payment solutions; deliver innovation and integration enabling differentiated value for our clients; and generate integration value, including cost and revenue synergies from acquisitions.Industry TrendsThe global payments landscape continues to evolve, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, e-commerce and real-time payments infrastructure. Because of this growth, competition also continues to intensify. Business and consumer expectations continue to rise, with a focus on speed, convenience, choice and security. To meet these expectations, payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology, expanding the use of data and enhancing the customer experience.MerchantsThe rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and e-commerce, driven by consumers’ desire for simpler, more efficient shopping experiences, has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers nearly anywhere, through any device, which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments. Merchants are demanding simpler, integrated and flexible systems to accept payments and help manage their everyday business operations. When combined with the ever-increasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services, merchants have sought modern systems to streamline the complexity. Furthermore, merchants can now search, discover, compare, purchase and even install a new system through direct, digital-only experiences. This direct, digital-only channel is a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities, especially with respect to smaller merchants. Additionally, there are numerous software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solution providers in the industry, many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring into their software as a way to further monetize their client relationships. Such providers are typically referred to as ISVs, and we believe there are thousands of these potential distribution partnership opportunities available to us. We believe that our merchant acquiring products and solutions create compelling value propositions for merchant clients of all sizes, from small and mid-sized businesses to medium-sized regional businesses to global enterprise merchants, and across all verticals. Furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with valued partnerships with merchant acquiring businesses of financial and non-financial institutions of all sizes, gives us a solid foundation for growth.Financial Institutions and Other Financial Technology ProvidersFinancial services providers regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, risk management, lending and investment products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions and other financial technology providers continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. These conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. In addition, the focus on the customer experience, including through mobile and online engagement, by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. We expect that financial institutions and other financial technology providers will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including a unified, seamless customer experience across mobile and online channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. 27Table of Contents The number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations transfer accounts among financial institutions. If a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition, we typically receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. These fees can vary from period to period with the variance depending on the quantum of financial institution merger activity in a given period and whether or not our clients are involved in the activity. Our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. Furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth.Recent Market ConditionsGlobal macroeconomic conditions, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, disruptions in the global supply chain, the effects of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the continuing impact of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, and regulations restricting trade or that impact our ability to offer products or services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, since 2021, we have observed increased shortages and delays in the global supply chain for components and inputs necessary to our businesses, such as semiconductors, paper and plastic, and may experience difficulty procuring those components and inputs in the future on a timely basis or at historical prices. For discussion of risks related to potential impacts of supply chain, geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges on our business, results of operations and financial condition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates.AcquisitionsFrom time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. The determination of fair value requires estimates about discount rates, growth and retention rates, royalty rates, expected future cash flows and other future events that are judgmental in nature. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Additional information regarding our acquisitions is included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.Goodwill and Intangible Assets We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is one level below our reportable segments. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the prior test’s amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry and 28Table of Contents other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test.The quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using both a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent annual impairment assessment of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2022 determined that our goodwill of $36.8 billion was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units exceeded the carrying values. However, for four of our reporting units, with aggregate goodwill of $10.9 billion, the excess of the respective reporting unit’s fair value over carrying value ranged from 7 to 18 percent. If future operating performance is below our expectations or there are material changes to forecasted revenue growth rates or operating margins, risk-adjusted discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates, effective income tax rates, or some combination thereof, a decline in the fair value of the reporting units could result in, and we may be required to record, a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, a significant change in a merchant alliance business relationship or operating performance could result in a material goodwill impairment charge. It is also reasonably possible that future developments related to the interest rate environment, a shift in strategic initiatives, or significant changes in the composition of certain of our reporting units could have a future material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment. We have no accumulated goodwill impairment through December 31, 2022. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We review capitalized software development costs for impairment at each reporting date. Recoverability of intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to either the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or the net realizable value of the asset, depending on the type of asset. Determining future cash flows and net realizable values involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future economic and market conditions. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Additional information regarding our intangible assets is included in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. As a practical expedient, we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. Contracts with customers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue is generated from account- and transaction-based fees for data processing, merchant transaction processing and acquiring, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds transfer and debit/credit processing services; consulting and professional services; and software maintenance for ongoing client support.We recognize processing and services revenue in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services, which revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services. Our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when- and if-needed basis (a stand-ready obligation) and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer. These services are typically provided under a fixed or declining (tier-based) price per unit based on volume of service; however, pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees. Fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis.29Table of Contents ProductProduct revenue is generated from print and card production sales, as well as software license and hardware (primarily POS devices) sales. For software license agreements that are distinct, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery, assuming a contract is deemed to exist. Revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization, modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended, such as labor hours, to measure progress towards completion. For arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer, a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software. We sell or lease hardware (POS devices) and other peripherals as part of our contracts with customers. Hardware typically consists of terminals or Clover devices. We do not manufacture hardware, rather we purchase hardware from third-party vendors and hold such hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer. We account for the sale of hardware as a separate performance obligation and recognize the revenue at the standalone selling price when the customer obtains control of the hardware.Significant JudgmentsWe use the following methods, inputs and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize. For multi-element arrangements, we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, if the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement, and if a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.Technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings. Whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances, including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers, to determine whether we obtain control of goods and services prior to their transfer to a customer.The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. We include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price. To the extent that variable consideration is not constrained, we include an estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract. We may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted. The transaction price (including any discounts or rebates) is allocated between distinct goods and services in a multi-element arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines. Judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service.Contract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price (or both) of the contract, or when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by us. When a contract modification occurs, it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as (i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract. Further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract, including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation. Additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires management’s judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, sometimes made more complex by our global footprint. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish a liability for known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. In establishing a liability for known tax exposures, assumptions are made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position will be sustained. A tax benefit with respect to a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits, considering the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. The amount of tax benefit recognized reflects the largest benefit that we 30Table of Contents believe is more likely than not to be realized on settlement with the relevant taxing authority. As additional information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our liability for known tax exposures as appropriate.We maintain net operating loss carryforwards in various taxing jurisdictions, resulting in the establishment of deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, based upon the weight of all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we have considered the relative impact of all of the available positive and negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income and available tax planning strategies. However, there could be a material impact to our effective income tax rate if there is a significant change in our judgment. To the extent our judgment changes, the valuation allowances are then adjusted, generally through the provision for income taxes, in the period in which the change in facts and circumstances occurs. Additional information regarding our income taxes is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.Results of OperationsComponents of Revenue and ExpensesThe following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue, which represented 82% of our total revenue in 2022, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services consists of costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; certain depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses.ProductProduct revenue, which represented 18% of our total revenue in 2022, is derived from print and card production sales, as well as software license and hardware (primarily POS devices) sales. Cost of product consists of costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and postage; software development; hardware costs (primarily POS devices); personnel; infrastructure costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; third-party commissions; advertising and promotional costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses.31Table of Contents Financial ResultsThe following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year.

The revenue increase was driven by higher processing revenue and product sales across all of our business segments, partially offset by a 2% decrease due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Revenue in our Acceptance segment increased $813 million, or 13%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase was driven by higher global merchant acquiring payment and transaction volumes, an increase in the number of active merchants on our Clover operating system and the expansion of our merchant relationships through value-added services. The revenue growth of our Clover and Carat operating systems were above pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels and contributed 5% and 1%, respectively, to Acceptance segment growth. The remaining revenue growth in our Acceptance segment was attributable to higher merchant acquiring payment and transaction volumes across our other merchant acquiring platforms. Revenue in our Fintech segment increased $148 million, or 5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase was driven by both higher processing revenue and license and termination fee revenue across our Fintech businesses, with each contributing approximately 2% to Fintech revenue growth.Revenue in our Payments segment increased $429 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase was driven by our debit processing business, which contributed 3% to Payments segment revenue growth through new client wins on our network routing services; our Output Solutions business, which contributed 2%, primarily driven by new client growth; and our credit processing business, which contributed 1%, primarily driven by an increase in active accounts. Revenue at Corporate and Other increased $121 million, or 14%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increased postage revenue. Total Expenses Total expenses in 2022 were relatively consistent compared to 2021. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased 700 basis points to 78.9% in 2022 compared to 2021. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were favorably impacted in 2022 by a reduction of approximately 390 basis points in acquisition and integration related expense and approximately 90 basis points in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue for 2022 were also favorably impacted by operating leverage, along with a pre-tax gain on the sale of businesses and other assets of $54 million.Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 39.9% in 2022 compared to 45.7% in 2021. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in 2022 by approximately 330 basis points from a reduction in acquisition and integration related expenses, as well as strong operating leverage across our businesses, and partially offset by an increase in severance costs of approximately 50 basis points in 2022.Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 67.8% in 2022 compared to 70.0% in 2021. The cost of product as a percentage of product revenue improved in 2022 as a result of higher margin revenue growth.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 34.2% in 2022 compared to 35.8% in 2021. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2022 was primarily due to a reduction in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of approximately 100 basis points.The net gain on sale of businesses and other assets in 2022 included a $137 million pre-tax gain from the sale of certain merchant contracts in conjunction with the mutual termination of one of our merchant alliance joint ventures and a $44 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A. and our SIS operations. These gains were partially offset by a $127 million pre-tax loss from the sale of our Korea operations.Operating Income and Operating Margin Total operating income increased $1,452 million, or 63%, in 2022 compared to 2021. Total operating margin increased 700 basis points to 21.1% in 2022 compared to 2021. Total operating income and total operating margin benefited from revenue growth in 2022, along with a reduction in acquisition and integration related expenses. Total operating income and total operating margin were also favorably impacted by a $54 million net pre-tax gain on the sale of businesses and other assets in 2022, partially offset by an increase in severance costs of approximately $130 million.33Table of Contents Operating income in our Acceptance segment increased $325 million, or 16%, in 2022 compared to 2021. Operating margin increased 100 basis points to 31.8% in 2022 compared to 2021. Operating margin growth in 2022 was primarily due to operating leverage and the divestiture of a lower-margin business within the Acceptance segment.Operating income in our Fintech segment increased $76 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 36.5% in 2022 compared to 2021. Fintech segment operating income and margin growth in 2022 was due to an increase in license and termination fee revenue.Operating income in our Payments segment increased $266 million, or 10%, in 2022 compared to 2021. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to 45.1% in 2022 compared to 2021. Payments segment operating income and margin growth in 2022 was primarily due to scalable revenue growth from our debit and credit processing businesses.The operating loss in Corporate and Other decreased $785 million in 2022 compared to 2021. Corporate and Other was favorably impacted by a reduction of approximately $850 million in acquisition and integration related costs and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. The operating loss in 2022 also included a $54 million pre-tax gain on the sale of businesses and other assets and approximately $130 million of increased severance costs.Interest Expense, NetInterest expense, net increased $40 million, or 6%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher interest rates on outstanding borrowings.Other (Expense) IncomeOther expense increased $165 million in 2022 compared to 2021. Other (expense) income includes net foreign currency transaction gains and losses, gains or losses from a change in fair value of investments in certain equity securities, and amounts related to debt guarantee arrangements of certain joint ventures. Net foreign currency transaction (losses) gains were $(62) million and $12 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other expense in 2022 also includes net pre-tax expense of $48 million associated with joint venture debt guarantees. Other income in 2021 included $12 million related to a pre-tax gain on the remeasurement of a previously held investment in Ondot to fair value upon acquiring the remaining ownership interest in the entity.Income Tax ProvisionIncome tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes and income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was 18.9% and 21.8% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily the result of $134 million of income tax expense in 2021 attributed to the revaluation of certain net deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangible assets and investments in joint ventures recognized at fair value in connection with the acquisition of First Data Corporation, reflecting the effect of enacted corporate income tax rate changes in the United Kingdom (tax rate increase from 19% to 25% starting in 2023) and Argentina (tax rate increase from 25% to 35%).Income from Investments in Unconsolidated AffiliatesOur share of net income from affiliates accounted for using the equity method is reported as income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and the related tax expense is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $220 million and $100 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2022 includes pre-tax gains totaling $209 million, primarily related to the acquisition-date fair value remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in Finxact of $110 million, as well as $80 million resulting from the dilution of our ownership interest in conjunction with the Sagent M&C, LLC transaction with a third party. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2021 included a $33 million pre-tax gain resulting from the sale of our remaining ownership interest in InvestCloud Holdings, LLC (“InvestCloud”), as well as a $28 million pre-tax gain resulting from the dilution of our ownership interest in connection with the Tegra118 merger with a third party.Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests relates to the minority partners’ share of the net income in our consolidated subsidiaries. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $52 million and $69 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.34Table of Contents Net Income Per Share - DilutedNet income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted was $3.91 and $1.99 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted in 2021 included $134 million of certain discrete tax expenses discussed above, as well as higher acquisition and integration related expenses. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralOur primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness, including finance leases; and (iii) fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied in both the short and long term using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $902 million, proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper, and available capacity under our revolving credit facility of $870 million (net of outstanding borrowings and $5.1 billion of capacity designated for outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs, senior notes due in 2023 and letters of credit) at December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively: Year EndedDecember 31,Increase (Decrease)(In millions)20222021$%Net income$2,582 $1,403 $1,179 Depreciation and amortization3,212 3,248 (36)Share-based compensation323 239 84 Deferred income taxes(558)(262)(296)Net gain on sale of businesses and other assets(54)— (54)Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates(220)(100)(120)Distributions from unconsolidated affiliates73 34 39 Non-cash impairment charges14 15 (1)Net changes in working capital and other(754)(543)(211)Net cash provided by operating activities$4,618 $4,034 $584 14 %Capital expenditures, including capitalized software and other intangibles$1,479 $1,160 $319 28 %Our operating cash flow was $4.6 billion in 2022, an increase of 14% compared with $4.0 billion in 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to improved operating results, partially offset by higher working capital use compared to the prior year, including increased accounts receivable corresponding to revenue growth and slower customer payments, as well as an increase in future credit card receivables purchased under our Clover Capital program.We maintain investments in various affiliates that are accounted for as equity method investments. Total distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, including those classified as cash flows from investing activities, were $211 million and $149 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 8% and 7% of our total revenue in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 35Table of Contents Cash RequirementsThe following table details our future cash requirements under certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2022:(In millions)TotalLess than1 year1-3 years3-5 yearsMore than5 yearsLong-term debt including interest (1) (2)$26,206 $950 $5,155 $9,705 $10,396 Minimum finance lease payments (1)576 183 272 120 1 Minimum operating lease payments (1) (2)868 141 220 175 332 Purchase obligations (1) 1,727 683 715 209 120 Income tax obligations96 10 36 41 9 Total$29,473 $1,967 $6,398 $10,250 $10,858 (1)Interest, finance lease, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis.(2)The calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, no additional refinancing or lending occurs, except for our 0.375% Euro-denominated senior notes due in July 2023, 3.800% senior notes due in October 2023, and U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper notes programs as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis through the issuance of new commercial paper notes upon maturity, and we have the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility maturing in June 2027. The variable rate on the revolving credit facility and term loans are priced at the rate in effect at December 31, 2022. Share RepurchasesWe repurchased $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion (including the repurchase described below) of our common stock in 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 16.9 million shares remaining under our then existing repurchase authorization. On February 22, 2023, our board of directors approved a repurchase authorization for an additional 75.0 million shares. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. In 2021, New Omaha Holdings L.P. (“New Omaha”), a shareholder of ours, completed an underwritten secondary public offering of 23.0 million shares of our common stock (the “offering”). We repurchased from the underwriters 5.0 million shares of our common stock that were subject to the offering. The share repurchase totaled $588 million and was funded with cash on hand. The repurchased shares were cancelled and no longer outstanding following the completion of the share repurchase. Acquisitions and Dispositions AcquisitionsWe acquired Yacaré and Merchant One in December 2022, NexTable in September 2022 and City POS in June 2022. Additionally, we acquired a remaining ownership interest in Finxact in April 2022, in which we previously held a noncontrolling interest. We acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $994 million, net of $28 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $6 million. We funded these acquisitions in 2022 by utilizing a combination of available cash and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.We acquired BentoBox in November 2021, AIP in October 2021, SpendLabs in June 2021, Pineapple Payments in May 2021, and Radius8 in March 2021. Additionally, we acquired a remaining ownership interest in NetPay in November 2021 and a remaining ownership interest in Ondot in January 2021, in which we previously held noncontrolling equity interests. We acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $882 million, net of $43 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions at an aggregate fair value of $34 million. We funded these acquisitions in 2021 by utilizing a combination of available cash, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and existing availability under our revolving credit facility.The results of operations for these acquired businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition.DispositionsWe sold Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A. and our SIS operations in October 2022 and our Korea operations in September 2022 for aggregate net cash proceeds of $77 million, along with a minority noncontrolling equity interest in the buyer of the Korea operations. Effective March 2022, we mutually agreed to terminate a merchant alliance joint venture with a minority partner. In conjunction with such termination, the joint venture minority partner elected to exercise its option to purchase certain additional merchant contracts of the joint venture for cash proceeds of $175 million. The net proceeds from these dispositions were primarily used to pay down indebtedness and repurchase shares of our common stock.36Table of Contents We previously maintained a noncontrolling interest in Tegra118, LLC (“Tegra118”) which was accounted for under the equity method. In February 2021, Tegra118 completed a merger with a third party, resulting in a dilution of our ownership interest in the combined new entity, Wealthtech Holdings, LLC, which was subsequently renamed as InvestCloud. In connection with the transaction, we made an additional capital contribution, funded under our revolving credit facility, of $200 million into the combined entity and, in June 2021, we sold our entire ownership interest in InvestCloud for $466 million. The net proceeds from the sale were primarily used to pay down outstanding borrowings on our term loan facility.IndebtednessOur debt consisted of the following at December 31:(In millions)20222021Short-term and current maturities of long-term debt:Foreign lines of credit$198 $240 Finance lease and other financing obligations270 268 Total short-term and current maturities of long-term debt$468 $508 Long-term debt:3.500% senior notes due October 2022$— $700 0.375% senior notes due July 2023 (Euro-denominated)531 566 3.800% senior notes due October 20231,000 1,000 2.750% senior notes due July 20242,000 2,000 3.850% senior notes due June 2025900 900 2.250% senior notes due July 2025 (British Pound-denominated)632 705 3.200% senior notes due July 20262,000 2,000 2.250% senior notes due June 20271,000 1,000 1.125% senior notes due July 2027 (Euro-denominated)531 566 4.200% senior notes due October 20281,000 1,000 3.500% senior notes due July 20293,000 3,000 2.650% senior notes due June 20301,000 1,000 1.625% senior notes due July 2030 (Euro-denominated)531 566 3.000% senior notes due July 2031 (British Pound-denominated)632 705 4.400% senior notes due July 20492,000 2,000 U.S. dollar commercial paper notes2,329 916 Euro commercial paper notes1,210 905 Revolving credit facility35 97 Receivable securitized loan— 500 Term loan facility200 200 Unamortized discount and deferred financing costs(120)(125)Finance lease and other financing obligations539 528 Total long-term debt$20,950 $20,729 At December 31, 2022, our debt consisted primarily of $16.8 billion of fixed-rate senior notes and $3.5 billion of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs. Interest on our U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes is paid semi-annually, while interest on our Euro and British Pound-denominated senior notes is paid annually. Interest on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper notes is generally paid weekly, or more frequently on occasion, and interest on our term loan is paid monthly. Outstanding borrowings under our 0.375% Euro-denominated senior notes due in July 2023, 3.800% senior notes due in October 2023, and U.S dollar and Euro commercial paper programs are classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as we have the intent to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis through the continued issuance of new commercial paper notes upon maturity, and we also have the ability to refinance such borrowings under our revolving credit facility, as further discussed below.37Table of Contents In July 2022, we redeemed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 3.500% senior notes due in October 2022 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We financed the redemption of these notes using proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar commercial paper. We also repaid $485 million, representing all amounts outstanding on our receivable securitized loan, in July 2022, using proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar commercial paper and terminated the underlying receivables financing agreement.In June 2022, we entered into a new senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility with substantially the same syndicate of banks that were lenders under our prior amended and restated revolving credit facility, which we voluntarily terminated and replaced. The new credit agreement matures in June 2027 and provides for a maximum aggregate principal amount of availability of $6.0 billion.

We maintain U.S. dollar and Euro unsecured commercial paper programs with various maturities generally ranging from one day to four months. Outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs bear interest based on the prevailing rates at the time of issuance. In August 2022, we increased our U.S. commercial paper program borrowing capacity to $6.0 billion to align with the maximum amount of availability under our revolving credit facility.As discussed above, we maintain a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments available for $6.0 billion of total capacity. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or a base rate in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, in each case plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. We are required to pay a facility fee based on the aggregate commitments in effect under the credit agreement from time to time.We maintain a term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. Outstanding borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a variable rate based on one-month LIBOR or a base rate, in each case plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. Debt Covenants and ComplianceThe indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. We may, at our option, redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the applicable maturity date.The new revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to, among other things, limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.75 times our consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and expenses and certain other adjustments (“EBITDA”) during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions.The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to, among other things, (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.5 times our EBITDA during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions, and (ii) maintain EBITDA of at least 3.0 times our consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended.38Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants. Our ability to meet future debt covenant requirements will depend on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows. We expect to remain in compliance with all terms and conditions associated with our outstanding debt, including financial debt covenants.Debt GuaranteesWe maintain noncontrolling ownership interests in Sagent M&C, LLC and defi SOLUTIONS Group, LLC (collectively, the “Lending Joint Ventures”). The Lending Joint Ventures maintain, as amended in April 2022, variable-rate term loan facilities with aggregate outstanding borrowings of $437 million in senior unsecured debt at December 31, 2022 and variable-rate revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $83 million with a syndicate of banks, which mature in April 2027. There were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2022. We have guaranteed the debt of the Lending Joint Ventures and do not anticipate that the Lending Joint Ventures will fail to fulfill their debt obligations. We maintained a liability of $40 million at December 31, 2022 for the estimated fair value of our non-contingent obligations to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee arrangements. Such guarantees will be amortized in future periods over the contractual term of the debt. In addition, we maintained a contingent liability of $21 million at December 31, 2022, representing the current expected credit losses to which we are exposed. This contingent liability is estimated based on certain financial metrics of the Lending Joint Ventures and historical industry data, which is used to develop assumptions of the likelihood the guaranteed parties will default and the level of credit losses in the event a default occurs. We have not made any payments under the guarantees, nor have we been called upon to do so. OtherAccess to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance maturing debt and fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2022, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. As of December 31, 2022, we had a commercial paper credit rating of P-2 from Moody’s and A-2 from S&P.The interest rates payable on certain of our senior notes, term loan and commercial paper notes programs are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates on certain senior notes are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.Cash and Cash EquivalentsInvestments, exclusive of settlement assets, with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash are considered to be cash equivalents as reflected within our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held $902 million and $835 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively.The table below details the cash and cash equivalents at December 31:20222021(In millions)DomesticInternationalTotalDomesticInternationalTotalAvailable$135 $153 $288 $180 $221 $401 Unavailable (1)178 436 614 138 296 434 Total $313 $589 $902 $318 $517 $835 (1)Represents cash held by our joint ventures that is not available to fund operations outside of those entities unless the board of directors of the relevant entity declares a dividend, as well as cash held by other entities that are subject to foreign exchange controls in certain countries or regulatory capital requirements.Employee Termination CostsWe recorded $187 million and $95 million of employee termination costs related to cash severance and other separation costs for terminated employees during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Employee termination costs include those charges incurred in connection with the acquisition of First Data Corporation during the year ended December 31, 2021. The employee severance and other separation costs accrued balance of $23 million at December 31, 2022 is expected to be paid within the next twelve months.39Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. Our senior management actively monitors certain market risks to which we are exposed, primarily from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In order to limit our exposure to these risks, we may enter into derivative instruments with creditworthy institutions to hedge against changing interest rates and foreign currency rate fluctuations. We currently utilize forward exchange contracts, fixed-to-fixed cross-currency rate swap contracts and other non-derivative hedging instruments to manage risk.Interest Rate RiskIn addition to existing cash and cash equivalents balances and cash provided by operating activities, we use a combination of fixed- and variable-rate debt instruments to finance our operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations. We had fixed- and variable-rate debt, excluding finance leases and other financing obligations, with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $16.8 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022. Our fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2022 primarily consisted of fixed-rate senior notes with a fair value of $15.2 billion, based on matrix pricing which considers readily observable inputs of comparable securities. The potential change in fair value of our fixed-rate senior notes from a hypothetical 1% change in market interest rates would not alone impact any decisions to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate debt instruments before their maturity. Our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2022 primarily consisted of outstanding U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper and borrowings on our variable rate term loan and foreign lines of credit. Based on our outstanding debt balances and interest rates at December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 1% increase in market interest rates related to our variable-rate debt would increase annual interest expense by approximately $40 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes the outstanding debt balances at December 31, 2022 and the change in market interest rates is applicable for an entire year. In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, funds received from subscribers are invested into short-term, highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. Fluctuations in market interest rates affect the interest-related income that we earn on these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the amount of such interest-related income was not material and, therefore, a hypothetical 1% decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on such income. This sensitivity analysis assumes the subscriber fund balances at December 31, 2022 and the change in market interest rates is applicable for an entire year.Foreign Currency RiskWe conduct business globally and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar-denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We manage the exposure to these risks through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, fixed-to-fixed cross-currency rate swap contracts and non-derivative net investment hedges. Translation gains and losses from non-U.S. subsidiaries are generally reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders’ equity on the consolidated balance sheets. For subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies, the financial statements are remeasured into U.S. dollars, and the foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in the consolidated statements of income, rather than in shareholders’ equity. The remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities resulted in foreign currency exchange losses of $52 million and $5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily related to Argentina.40Table of Contents Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arise from our non-U.S. operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency. Approximately 14% of our total revenue was generated outside the U.S in each of 2022 and 2021. The major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro and Indian Rupee. A strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which our revenue and profits are denominated by 10% would have resulted in a decrease or increase, respectively, in our reported pre-tax income as follows at December 31:(In millions) 20222021Argentine Peso$5 $4 Brazilian Real5 6 British Pound1 5 Canadian Dollar5 4 Euro7 16 Indian Rupee5 3 Other— 1 Total increase or decrease$28 $39 We maintain foreign currency forward exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. At December 31, 2022, the notional amount of these derivatives was $346 million, with a fair value of $(8) million. In addition, we maintain fixed-to-fixed cross-currency rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in certain subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the Euro. At December 31, 2022, aggregate notional cross-currency rate swaps of 400 million Euro were designated as net investment hedges. We also designated our Euro- and British Pound-denominated senior notes and Euro commercial paper notes as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investment in certain subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the Euro and British Pound.41Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:20:15.850687

798354,FI,FISERV INC,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows: • Recent developments. This section provides a general description of recent events and significant developments that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition. • Critical accounting policies. This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. • Recent accounting pronouncements. This section provides a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition. • Non-GAAP financial measures. This section provides a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures which we use in this report. • Results of operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2006 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2005 and comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2005 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2004. 19 Table of Contents • Liquidity and capital resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments that existed as of December 31, 2006. Included in the discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of our financial capacity to fund our future commitments and a discussion of other financing arrangements. Recent Developments Historically, our operations consisted of three business segments based on the services provided by each: financial institution outsourcing, systems and services; health plan management services; and investment support services. As part of our Fiserv 2.0 initiative, we are focused on providing products and services in a more integrated manner. Accordingly, in December 2006, we announced a reorganization of our businesses to provide for a more streamlined structure. The new organization allows us to provide integrated technology-based solutions to each of the three main areas of the insurance industry: health, life, and property and casualty. As a result of this reorganization, we have modified our reporting segments such that our new reporting segments are: Financial Institution Services (“Financial”); Insurance Services (“Insurance”); and Investment Support Services (“Investment”). Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. The majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized when the related services have been rendered. Revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices do not contain significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the underlying carrying value or reporting unit carrying value to their fair values. As of the most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2006, we determined that the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets do not exceed their respective fair values. We are required to perform this comparison, which involves a number of assumptions, at least annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. Given the significance of goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial statements. We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than operating leases. In addition, we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and managing our ratio of fixed to floating-rate long-term debt. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”), requires companies to expense the value of employee stock option grants and similar awards. We adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006 under the modified prospective method. Accordingly, prior periods 20 Table of Contents do not include share-based compensation expense related to SFAS 123R. Share-based compensation expense was $28.5 million and $4.0 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock options, restricted stock and our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the intrinsic value provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”). Under APB 25, the difference between the quoted market price on the date of grant and the contractual purchase price of shares was recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. As a result, we did not recognize compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements for stock options because the exercise price was not less than 100% of the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers’ balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the changes occur. The recognition provisions of SFAS 158 became effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return, and provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We expect that the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this report, we use two non-GAAP financial measures, internal revenue growth percentage and free cash flow. We use these measures to monitor and evaluate our performance, and they are presented in this report because we believe that they are useful to investors in evaluating our financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The methods that we use to calculate non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Internal revenue growth percentage is measured as the increase or decrease in total revenue for the current year less “acquired revenue from acquisitions” divided by total revenues from the prior year plus “acquired revenue from acquisitions.” “Acquired revenue from acquisitions” represents pre-acquisition revenue of acquired companies, less dispositions, for the prior year. “Acquired revenue from acquisitions” was $111.3 million ($69.3 million in the Financial segment and $42.1 million in the Insurance segment) and $67.5 million ($44.5 million in the Financial segment and $23.0 million in the Insurance segment) in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Internal revenue growth percentage is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors because it allows them to see the portion of our revenue growth that is attributed to acquired companies as compared to internal revenue growth. Free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors because it shows our available cash flow after we have satisfied the capital requirements of our operations. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations Components of Revenue and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Processing and Services Processing and services revenues are primarily generated from account and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been rendered. Processing and services revenues are most reflective of our core business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain applications; customer support; depreciation; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenue is primarily derived from our pharmacy businesses, software license fees and integrated print and electronic communications. A significant amount of product revenue is derived from our pharmacy businesses within the Insurance segment because we include, in both revenues and expenses, the prescription product costs associated with these businesses. We do not manufacture or generally distribute prescription pharmaceuticals, but we are considered to be a principal under Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 99-19, “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent,” as more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we record these revenues and expenses on a gross basis. Prescription product costs included in both product revenues and cost of product were $753.1 million, $540.0 million and $439.6 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cost of products, in addition to pharmacy product costs, include personnel, infrastructure costs and other costs directly associated with product revenue. We also include customer reimbursements, such as postage and telecommunication costs, in processing and services revenue, product revenue, cost of processing and services, and cost of product in accordance with EITF 01-14, “Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for ‘Out-of-Pocket’ Expenses Incurred.” These costs, which are pass-through expenses to clients and which are included in both revenues and expenses, were $416.1 million, $351.0 million and $379.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; and other selling and administrative expenses. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenues, and the percentage change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

(2) Each percentage of revenue equals the relevant expense or operating income amount divided by total revenues. Total Revenues Total revenues increased $484.7 million, or 12%, in 2006 compared to 2005, and $329.7 million, or 9%, in 2005 compared to 2004. The internal revenue growth rate was 9% in 2006 and 7% in 2005 with the remaining growth resulting from acquisitions. Overall internal revenue growth is primarily derived from sales to new clients, cross-sales to existing clients and increases in transaction volumes from existing clients. The improvement in the total revenue growth rate for 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to increased prescription revenue from new clients in the Insurance segment’s pharmacy management and workers’ compensation businesses. Processing and services revenues increased 5% in 2006 and 6% in 2005 compared to the prior year periods. These increases were driven by sales to new clients, cross-sales to existing clients, increases in transaction volumes from existing clients and incremental revenue attributable to several acquisitions. Partially offsetting these increases in 2006 were a $34.5 million decrease in contract termination fees and the impact of the loss of two clients in 2005. Contract termination and assignment fees were $23.4 million, $57.9 million and $36.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Financial segment businesses generally enter into three to five year contracts with clients that contain early contract termination fees. These fees can be generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary significantly from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term a client is acquired. Product revenues increased 30% in 2006 compared to 2005 and 18% in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to new clients in the Insurance segment’s pharmacy management and workers’ compensation businesses 23 Table of Contents along with growth in card fulfillment and print services within the output solutions division. The revenue growth in the pharmacy management and workers’ compensation businesses in the Insurance segment was impacted significantly by the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenues and expenses of $753.1 million, $540.0 million and $439.6 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total Expenses Total expenses increased $485.8 million, or 15%, in 2006 compared to 2005 and $243.9 million, or 8%, in 2005 compared to 2004. These increases were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenues were relatively consistent in 2006 as compared to 2005 and the slight increase from 64% in 2005 to 65% in 2006 was primarily caused by a decrease of $34.5 million in 2006 of higher margin contract termination fee revenue. These fees, which were significantly higher in 2005 than 2006, do not generate substantial incremental cost when received. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenues decreased in 2006 and 2005 from 67% in 2004 due primarily to changes in the mix of our businesses, including acquisitions and the impact of operating efficiencies. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 82% in 2006, 81% in 2005 and 80% in 2004. The increases in cost of product were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs in 2006 and 2005 as discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expenses have remained relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006 were negatively impacted by the inclusion of $17.3 million of incremental share-based compensation expense as a result of the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, and $9.0 million related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending division. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income decreased $1.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and operating margins decreased to 16% in 2006 from 18% in 2005 and 2004. Operating income and margin in 2006, as compared to 2005, was negatively impacted by a $34.5 million decrease in higher margin contract termination fees, a $24.5 million increase in share-based compensation expense related to the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, operating losses associated with the Australian check processing operations and charges of $9.0 million related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in the lending division. Partially offsetting these decreases in operating income and margin were increases in higher margin revenues in the electronic payments and flood insurance processing businesses, continued strong operating results in bank and credit union core processing and improvements in overall operating efficiencies. In addition, operating margins in 2006 and 2005 were negatively impacted by the significant revenue growth in the pharmacy management and workers’ compensation businesses, which generate operating margins in the low- to mid-single digits. The negative impact on operating margins due to the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense was approximately 3 percentage points in 2006 and 2005 and 2 percentage points in 2004. Segment Results In connection with organizational changes in 2006, we reclassified our reportable segments for all periods presented to align them with how our chief operating decision maker currently manages the business. As a result, our continuing operations are classified into three business segments: Financial Institution Services (“Financial”); 24 Table of Contents Insurance Services (“Insurance”); and Investment Support Services (“Investment”). The historical business segment information presented below has been restated to conform to our new business segment reporting structure. Years ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) Financial Insurance Investment Total Total revenues: 2006 $ 2,877.4 $ 1,529.6 $ 137.1 $ 4,544.2 2005 2,650.0 1,275.0 134.4 4,059.5 2004 2,451.4 1,152.8 125.5 3,729.7 Operating income: 2006 $ 565.0 $ 154.3 $ 25.0 $ 744.3 2005 581.1 139.2 25.0 745.4 2004 514.1 124.9 20.6 659.6 Operating income growth (decline)(1): 2006 (3 )% 11 % 0 % 0 % 2005 13 % 12 % 22 % 13 % Operating margin: 2006 20 % 10 % 18 % 16 % 2005 22 % 11 % 19 % 18 % 2004 21 % 11 % 16 % 18 % (1) Represents operating income growth (decline) compared to the prior period. Financial The Financial segment increased total revenues by $227.4 million, or 9%, in 2006 and $198.6 million, or 8%, in 2005. The internal revenue growth rate in the Financial segment was 6% in 2006 and 2005 with the remaining growth in each year resulting from acquisitions. Internal revenue growth in this segment was primarily driven by increased volumes and new clients in the electronic payments and loan settlement services businesses along with new client growth and increased sales in the banking and credit union core processing businesses and card fulfillment businesses. In 2006, internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by a $34.5 million decrease in contract termination fees and the loss of two clients in 2005. In 2005, internal revenue growth was positively impacted by a $21.5 million increase in contract termination fees. Operating margins in the Financial segment were 20% in 2006, 22% in 2005 and 21% in 2004. In comparison to 2005, operating margins in 2006 were negatively impacted by a decrease of $34.5 million in higher margin contract termination fees, an increase of $20.8 million in share-based compensation expense related to the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, operating losses associated with the Australian check processing operations and charges totaling $9.0 million related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in the lending division. Partially offsetting these negative factors in 2006 were higher margin revenues in the electronic payments businesses, continued strong operating results in the bank and credit union processing businesses and overall operating efficiencies. Operating margins in 2005 were positively impacted over 2004 primarily by a $21.5 million increase in contract termination fees. Insurance Revenues in the Insurance segment increased $254.6 million, or 20%, in 2006 compared to 2005 and $122.3 million, or 11%, in 2005 compared to 2004. The internal revenue growth rate in this segment was 16% in 2006 and 8% in 2005 with the remaining growth resulting from acquisitions. The internal revenue growth rates were primarily driven by the signing of new clients in the pharmacy management and workers’ compensation businesses. 25 Table of Contents Operating margins in the Insurance segment were 10% in 2006 compared to 11% in 2005 and 2004. Operating margins in 2006 were negatively impacted primarily by the significant increase in revenues in the pharmacy management and workers’ compensation businesses, which generate operating margins in the low- to mid-single digits, and expenses associated with our consumer-directed health care initiatives. Partially offsetting these factors were higher operating margins in our flood and property and casualty insurance businesses. The inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense negatively impacted operating margins in the Insurance segment by 10 percentage points, 8 percentage points and 7 percentage points in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investment The Investment segment had revenue growth of $2.7 million in 2006 and $8.9 million in 2005 representing revenue growth of 2% and 7%, respectively. Revenue growth in each year was primarily the result of new client growth. Revenue growth in 2006 was lower than 2005 primarily due to a decrease in deposit levels resulting from strong equity markets which negatively impacted investment income and corresponding revenues. Operating margins in the Investment segment were 18% in 2006, 19% in 2005 and 16% in 2004. Operating income and margin in 2006 were negatively impacted by the mix of revenue with a lower level of higher margin investment income as compared to 2005. The increase in operating income and margin in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to a temporary increase in cash investment balances in 2005 that improved net investment income. Discontinued Operations On March 24, 2005, we completed the sale of our securities clearing businesses to Fidelity Global Brokerage Group, Inc. (“Fidelity”) for $344.9 million paid in cash at closing, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Prior to completion of the sale, the securities clearing businesses paid a $68.0 million cash distribution to us. The sales proceeds, net of related expenses, including taxes that became due upon the sale of the securities clearing businesses, approximated the carrying value of this investment. In 2005, we recorded a net loss on the sale of discontinued operations of $0.4 million, net of related income taxes of $48.7 million. The higher income tax expense on the sale of the securities clearing operations was primarily due to a significantly lower tax basis than book basis mainly due to a tax free exchange in our initial purchase of one of the companies that was sold. During 2005, we recorded $0.03 per share in diluted earnings in discontinued operations primarily as a result of favorable resolutions of income tax uncertainties. In 2006, we finalized and recognized a $10.6 million pre-tax gain related to a contingent payment that we received from Fidelity based on the securities clearing businesses’ achievement of revenue targets established in the stock purchase agreement. We are investigating a matter identified in an indemnification notice delivered pursuant to the stock purchase agreement. The matter relates to the securities clearing businesses’ past maintenance of certain documentation related to introducing broker dealers’ customers. We are unable to estimate or predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or to determine whether this matter will have a material adverse impact on the discontinued operations’ results. Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest expense was $41.0 million, $27.8 million and $24.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $13.2 million increase in interest expense in 2006 was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings outstanding due to acquisitions and additional share repurchases in 2005 and 2006. Interest income was $7.0 million, $13.6 million and $6.7 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $6.6 million decrease in interest income in 2006 and the $6.9 million increase in interest income in 2005 was primarily due to increased cash balances in 2005 resulting from the proceeds we received for the sale of our securities clearing businesses. 26 Table of Contents Realized Gain from Sale of Investments In 2005, we realized a pre-tax gain of $43.5 million, or $0.14 per share after income taxes, from the sale of our remaining ownership of 3.2 million shares of common stock of Bisys Group, Inc. In addition, we sold our investment in INTRIA Items, Inc. to our joint venture partner, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $43.4 million, or $0.15 per share after income taxes. Income Tax Provision The effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 37.6% in 2006, 37.5% in 2005 and 38.4% in 2004. The effective income tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were favorably impacted by a number of one-time items compared to 2004 primarily associated with changes in state tax laws, finalization of various tax returns and a lower tax rate on the sale of investments. We expect that the income tax rate for continuing operations will be 38.5% in 2007. Net Income Per Share-Diluted Net income per share-diluted for 2006 was $2.53 compared to $2.70 in 2005 and $1.91 in 2004. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $2.50 in 2006 compared to $2.68 in 2005 and $2.00 in 2004. Net income per share-diluted in 2006 compared to 2005 was negatively impacted by a decrease of $0.29 per share from realized gains on sale of investments in 2005, approximately $0.12 per share from a decrease in contract termination fees in 2006, $0.09 per share of incremental share-based compensation expense in 2006 due to the prospective adoption of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006 and $0.03 per share related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending division in 2006. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations for 2005 of $2.68 compared to $2.00 in 2004 was positively impacted by $0.29 per share due to the realized gain on sale of investments in 2005 and approximately $0.07 per share from an increase in contract termination fees in 2005 compared to 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our free cash flow: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 635.0 $ 601.2 $ 699.0 Capital expenditures (187.5 ) (165.0 ) (161.1 ) Free cash flow $ 447.5 $ 436.2 $ 537.9 Free cash flow increased by $11.3 million in 2006 compared with 2005 and was impacted by a higher level of capital expenditures in 2006. Capital expenditures increased $22.5 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to a series of investments to support future client growth. Free cash flow in 2006 was negatively impacted by lower contract termination fee revenue, after income taxes, of approximately $21 million and $11.2 million due to the treatment of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, which are required by SFAS 123R to be included in cash flows from financing activities instead of operating cash flows as they were in 2005 and prior years. In 2006, we used our free cash flow and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program primarily to fund acquisition related payments of $186.7 million and to repurchase 12.7 million shares of our common stock for $560.1 million. As of December 31, 2006, 0.4 million shares of our common stock were available for repurchase under previous authorizations by our board of directors. On January 31, 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10.0 million additional shares of our common stock. Share repurchases under the existing authorization are expected to be made through open market transactions as market conditions warrant. Shares repurchased have historically been held for issuance in connection with acquisitions and equity plans. Our current policy is to use our free cash flow to support future business opportunities and repurchase shares of our common stock, rather than to pay dividends. 27 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, we had $747.3 million of long-term debt of which $451.8 million was outstanding under our revolving credit and commercial paper facilities. We maintain a $500 million unsecured commercial paper program, which is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. Under this program, we may issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We also maintain a $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. We may increase the availability under this facility up to $1.25 billion at our discretion, subject to a number of conditions, including the absence of any default under the credit agreement. The revolving credit facility supports 100% of our outstanding commercial paper. As a result, borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce the amount of credit available under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants. Among other requirements, our consolidated indebtedness is limited to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The facility expires on March 24, 2011. We were in compliance with all debt covenants throughout 2006. We believe that our cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds will be adequate to meet our operating requirements, required operating lease payments, required repayments of long-term debt, and expected capital spending needs in 2007. At December 31, 2006, we had $435 million available for borrowing under our credit and commercial paper facilities and $185 million of cash and cash equivalents. In the event that we make significant future acquisitions, we may raise funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of common shares. Historically, our growth has been accomplished, to a significant degree, through the acquisition of businesses that are complementary to our operations. We believe that a number of acquisition candidates are available that would further enhance our competitive position and we plan to pursue them. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases. Purchase obligations primarily relate to agreements to purchase or license data processing equipment and software. The following table details our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2006: (In millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt $ 747.3 $ 5.4 $ 288.8 $ 453.1 $ — Minimum operating lease payments 393.4 97.7 146.7 91.5 57.5 Purchase obligations 43.1 19.7 5.4 18.0 — Total $ 1,183.8 $ 122.8 $ 440.9 $ 562.6 $ 57.5 28 Table of Contents QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) (In thousands, except per share data) Quarters First Second Third Fourth Total 2006 Total revenues $ 1,096,668 $ 1,093,197 $ 1,156,545 $ 1,197,741 $ 4,544,151 Total expenses 903,715 909,008 970,805 1,016,342 3,799,870 Operating income 192,953 184,189 185,740 181,399 744,281 Interest expense, net (6,106 ) (8,774 ) (9,987 ) (9,129 ) (33,996 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 186,847 175,415 175,753 172,270 710,285 Income tax provision 70,636 64,435 65,665 66,324 267,060 Income from continuing operations 116,211 110,980 110,088 105,946 443,225 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes — 6,689 — — 6,689 Net income $ 116,211 $ 117,669 $ 110,088 $ 105,946 $ 449,914 Net income per share—basic: Continuing operations $ 0.65 $ 0.63 $ 0.63 $ 0.62 $ 2.53 Discontinued operations — 0.04 — — 0.04 Total $ 0.65 $ 0.67 $ 0.63 $ 0.62 $ 2.57 Net income per share—diluted: Continuing operations $ 0.64 $ 0.63 $ 0.63 $ 0.61 $ 2.50 Discontinued operations — 0.04 — — 0.04 Total $ 0.64 $ 0.66 $ 0.63 $ 0.61 $ 2.53 (In thousands, except per share data) Quarters First Second Third Fourth Total 2005 Total revenues $ 973,114 $ 996,426 $ 1,011,645 $ 1,078,293 $ 4,059,478 Total expenses 785,098 809,181 840,126 879,677 3,314,082 Operating income 188,016 187,245 171,519 198,616 745,396 Interest expense, net (3,662 ) (1,280 ) (3,429 ) (5,896 ) (14,267 ) Realized gain from sale of investments 43,452 — — 43,370 86,822 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 227,806 185,965 168,090 236,090 817,951 Income tax provision 88,161 71,968 58,751 87,714 306,594 Income from continuing operations 139,645 113,997 109,339 148,376 511,357 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (619 ) — 3,600 2,100 5,081 Net income $ 139,026 $ 113,997 $ 112,939 $ 150,476 $ 516,438 Net income per share—basic: Continuing operations $ 0.72 $ 0.60 $ 0.58 $ 0.81 $ 2.71 Discontinued operations — — 0.02 0.01 0.03 Total $ 0.72 $ 0.60 $ 0.60 $ 0.82 $ 2.74 Net income per share—diluted: Continuing operations $ 0.71 $ 0.59 $ 0.58 $ 0.80 $ 2.68 Discontinued operations — — 0.02 0.01 0.03 Total $ 0.71 $ 0.59 $ 0.60 $ 0.81 $ 2.70 29 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on investments and borrowings. We actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management. Our Investment Support Services subsidiaries accept money market account deposits from customers and invest those funds in marketable securities. Substantially all of the investments are rated within the highest investment grade categories for securities. Our Investment Support Services subsidiaries utilize simulation models for measuring and monitoring interest rate risk and market value of portfolio equities. A formal Asset Liability Committee meets quarterly to review interest rate risks, capital ratios, liquidity levels, portfolio diversification, credit risk ratings and adherence to investment policies and guidelines. At December 31, 2006, mortgage-backed obligations have an average duration of approximately three years and eleven months with most of the remaining investments having a maturity of one year or less. We do not believe significant changes in interest rates would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating-rate debt and through the use of interest rate swaps. We use interest rate swaps to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs. Generally, under these swaps, we agree with a counter-party to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount. While changes in interest rates could decrease our interest income or increase our interest expense, we do not believe that we have a material exposure to changes in interest rates. Based on our long-term debt with variable interest rates as of December 31, 2006, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately $4.8 million. Based on our internal controls, we believe the risks associated with financial instruments at December 31, 2006 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.",2023-12-30 20:20:13.058504
798354,FI,FISERV INC,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows: • Recent developments. This section provides a general description of recent events that are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. • Critical accounting policies. This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. • Recent accounting pronouncements. This section provides a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. • Non-GAAP financial measure. This section provides a discussion of internal revenue growth, a non-GAAP financial measure that we use in this report. • Results of operations. This section contains an analysis of our results of operations by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2007 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2006, and comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2006 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2005. 22 Table of Contents • Liquidity and capital resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments as of December 31, 2007. Recent Developments In December 2007, we acquired CheckFree, a leader in electronic commerce services and products, including electronic bill payment and Internet banking, for approximately $4.4 billion in cash and sold CredStar, a mortgage credit reporting unit. In the first quarter of 2008, we sold Fiserv Health to UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc. for $721 million in cash, which amount includes initial adjustments for net working capital and certain indebtedness of Fiserv Health and its subsidiaries as of the closing, and we sold the majority of our Fiserv Investment Support Services business to TD Ameritrade Online Holdings, Inc. for $225 million in cash at closing, plus the amount of acquired regulatory capital. We also sold Del Mar Database, a provider of loan broker management products, in the first quarter of 2008. The operations of Fiserv Health, Fiserv ISS and the two lending businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In connection with the sale of the portion of the Fiserv ISS business to TD Ameritrade Online Holdings, Inc., we can earn contingent cash consideration of up to $100 million based on the achievement of revenue targets over the twelve months subsequent to closing. With respect to the second part of the Fiserv ISS transaction, Robert Beriault Holdings, Inc. has agreed to acquire the remaining accounts and net capital of Fiserv ISS, including the investment administration services business which provides back office and custody services for individual retirement accounts, for approximately $50 million in cash. We will retain a minority interest in this business; however, our continuing involvement is not expected to be significant. This portion of the Fiserv ISS disposition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2008, and is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Our operations are classified into three business segments: our financial institution services business segment; our insurance services business segment; and our CheckFree business segment. Due to the planned disposition of Fiserv ISS, our previously reported investment support services business segment is included in our results of discontinued operations. In the first quarter of 2008, we expect that we will realign our business segments when our new reporting structure and CheckFree integration plans are finalized. Critical Accounting Policies General Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized when the related services have been rendered. Revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 23 Table of Contents Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require a significant amount of judgment. We use the information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definite-lived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. We review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”). SFAS 142 requires us to perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge. Additionally, we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2007 determined that the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not impaired. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial statements. Other We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than operating leases. In addition, we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and managing our ratio of fixed to floating-rate long-term debt. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the anticipated adoption dates, which is incorporated herein by reference. Non-GAAP Financial Measure In this report, we refer to internal revenue growth percentage, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We use internal revenue growth percentage to monitor and evaluate our performance, and it is presented in this report because we believe that it allows investors to see the portion of our revenue growth that is attributed to acquired companies as compared to internal revenue growth. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered to be a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The method that we use to calculate internal revenue growth percentage is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 24 Table of Contents Internal revenue growth percentage is measured as the increase or decrease in total revenue for the current year less “acquired revenue from acquisitions” divided by total revenues from the prior year plus “acquired revenue from acquisitions.” “Acquired revenue from acquisitions” represents pre-acquisition revenue of acquired companies, less dispositions, for the prior year. “Acquired revenue from acquisitions” was $147 million ($44 million in the Financial segment and $103 million in the Insurance segment) and $99 million ($66 million in the Financial segment and $33 million in the Insurance segment) in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Internal revenue growth percentages exclude our recent acquisition of CheckFree because only a partial month of CheckFree revenue was recorded in December 2007. Results of Operations Components of Revenues and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Processing and Services Processing and services revenues, which in 2007 represented approximately 70% of our consolidated revenues, are primarily generated from account and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been rendered. Processing and services revenues are most reflective of our core business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain applications; customer support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenues, which in 2007 represented approximately 30% of our consolidated revenues, are primarily derived from prescription product (approximately 10%), software license (approximately 5%), and integrated print, electronic communications and other (approximately 15%). Product revenues in our Insurance segment include workers’ compensation prescription product costs for which we are the principal under the indicators set forth in Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 99-19, “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent.” Prescription product revenues are recognized on a gross basis to include the prescription price based on established fee schedules or usual and customary rates. Prescription product costs included in both product revenues and cost of product were $449 million, $367 million and $295 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cost of product, in addition to prescription product costs, includes the following: personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. We also include customer reimbursements, such as postage and telecommunication costs, in processing and services revenue, product revenue, cost of processing and services, and cost of product in accordance with EITF 01-14, “Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for ‘Out-of-Pocket’ Expenses Incurred.” These costs, which are pass-through expenses to clients and which are included in both revenues and expenses, were $432 million, $409 million and $345 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenues and the percentage change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

(2) Each percentage of revenue equals the relevant expense or operating income amount divided by total revenues. Total Revenues Total revenues increased $356 million, or 10%, in 2007 compared to 2006, and $325 million, or 10%, in 2006 compared to 2005. The internal revenue growth rate was 3% in 2007 and 7% in 2006 with the remaining growth resulting from acquisitions. Overall internal revenue growth is primarily derived from sales to new clients, cross-sales to existing clients and increases in transaction volumes from existing clients. The higher internal revenue growth rate in 2006 compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increase in pass-through prescription revenue from new clients and increased volumes in our Insurance segment’s workers’ compensation businesses which had a positive impact of approximately two percentage points in 2006. Processing and services revenues increased 8% and 6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. These increases were driven by sales to new clients, cross-sales to existing clients, increases in transaction volumes from existing clients and incremental revenue attributable to several acquisitions, including a partial month of processing and services revenues totaling $84 million from the acquisition of CheckFree on December 3, 2007. Partially offsetting these increases in 2007 were a $33 million decrease in flood claims processing revenues in our Insurance segment and revenue decreases in our lending processing businesses due to lower processing volumes primarily resulting from a downturn in the mortgage markets in the United States. Partially offsetting the increases in 2006 were a $35 million decrease in contract termination fees and the impact of the loss of two clients in 2005. Contract termination fees were $35 million, $23 million and $58 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Businesses in our Financial segment generally enter into three to five year contracts with clients that contain early contract termination fees. These fees can be generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary significantly from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term a client is acquired. 26 Table of Contents Product revenues increased 14% and 21% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. These increases were primarily due to incremental revenue attributable to new clients and increased volumes in the Insurance segment’s workers’ compensation businesses, growth in card fulfillment and print services within our output solutions division, and an acquisition in 2007. The revenue growth in our workers’ compensation businesses was impacted significantly by the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenues and expenses of $449 million, $367 million and $295 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Total Expenses Total expenses increased $291 million, or 10%, in 2007 compared to 2006 and $322 million, or 12%, in 2006 compared to 2005. These increases were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenues declined to 61.6% in 2007 as compared to 63.4% and 63.1% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2007 was primarily due to operating efficiencies in the Financial segment resulting from the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered costs and the positive impact of higher-margin transaction and payment related revenues, partially offset by a decrease in higher-margin flood claims processing revenues. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 79.7% in 2007, 77.8% in 2006 and 77.1% in 2005. The increases in cost of product were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs in 2007 and 2006 as discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 14.2% in 2007 from 13.6% and 12.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2007 were negatively impacted by the following: charges totaling $12 million primarily related to employee severance and facility shutdown expenses in our lending businesses to reduce our cost structure due in part to the significant downturn in the mortgage markets in the United States in the second half of 2007; merger and integration costs of $8 million related to our acquisition of CheckFree, including integration project management, employee severance and retention bonuses; a charge of $8 million associated with the amendment of an employment agreement related to the creation of our wholly-owned offshore captive operation; and amortization expense of $6 million related to intangible assets acquired in the CheckFree acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2007 and 2006 included $13 million and $16 million, respectively, of incremental share-based compensation expense as a result of the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. In addition, 2006 included charges of $9 million related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending businesses. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income increased $65 million, or 10%, in 2007 compared to 2006 and operating margins were 18.6% in 2007 and 2006, compared to 20.4% in 2005. Our operating margin in 2007 compared to 2006 was positively impacted by strong performance in our Financial segment offset by our Insurance segment performance and several charges as explained below. In 2007, operating income and margins were positively impacted by increases in higher-margin revenues in our electronic payments businesses, continued strong operating results in our bank and credit union core processing businesses and improvements in overall operating efficiencies. In addition, CheckFree contributed operating income of $14 million in the month of December. These positive factors were partially offset by a $33 million decrease in higher-margin flood claims processing revenues in our Insurance segment, charges totaling $12 million primarily related to employee severance and facility shutdown expenses in our lending businesses, merger and integration costs of $8 million related to our acquisition of CheckFree, and a charge of $8 million associated with the amendment of an employment agreement related to the creation of our wholly-owned offshore captive operation. 27 Table of Contents Operating income and margin in 2006 as compared to 2005 was positively impacted by strong Financial and Insurance segment results and was negatively impacted by a $35 million decrease in higher-margin contract termination fees, a $22 million increase in share-based compensation expense related to the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, operating losses associated with our Australian check processing operations and charges of $9 million related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending businesses. In addition, operating margins in both 2007 and 2006 were negatively impacted by revenue growth in our workers’ compensation businesses, which generate operating margins in the low- to mid-single digits. The negative impact on operating margins due to the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense was approximately two percentage points in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Segment Results Our continuing operations are classified into three business segments: our financial institution services business segment (our Financial segment); our insurance services business segment (our Insurance segment); and our CheckFree business segment (our CheckFree segment). The businesses that make up our Financial segment provide account and transaction processing systems and services to financial institutions, such as banks, thrifts and credit unions, and other financial intermediaries. The businesses that comprise our Insurance segment provide a wide range of services to insurance carriers, agents and distributors. The businesses that comprise our CheckFree segment provide online banking, electronic billing and payment, software applications and investment management solutions to financial institutions and financial services organizations. CheckFree is presented as a separate segment because it was acquired on December 3, 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, we expect that we will realign our business segments when our new reporting structure and CheckFree integration plans are finalized. The following table presents, for the years indicated, revenues, operating income, and operating margin for our business segments. Years ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) Financial Insurance CheckFree(3) Total Total revenues: 2007 $ 3,006 $ 829 $ 87 $ 3,922 2006 2,838 728 — 3,566 2005 2,611 630 — 3,241 Revenue growth(1): 2007 6 % 14 % — 10 % 2006 9 % 16 % — 10 % Operating income: 2007(2) $ 667 $ 63 $ 14 $ 744 2006 566 99 — 665 2005 578 84 — 662 Operating income growth (decline)(1): 2007(2) 18 % (36 )% — 12 % 2006 (2 )% 18 % — 0 % Operating margin: 2007(2) 22.2 % 7.5 % 16.7 % 19.0 % 2006 19.9 % 13.6 % — 18.6 % 2005 22.1 % 13.3 % — 20.4 % (1) Represents revenue or operating income growth (decline) compared to the prior year. (2) Operating income and margin excludes merger and integration costs associated with acquisitions and a charge associated with the amendment of an employment agreement related to the creation of an offshore captive totaling $14 million which are not allocated to the segments. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating income to operating income reported on the consolidated statement of income. (3) We acquired CheckFree on December 3, 2007 and, as a result, the 2007 results include 28 days of CheckFree operations and amortization expense from acquired intangible assets of $9 million. 28 Table of Contents Financial Revenues in our Financial segment increased $168 million, or 6%, in 2007 and $227 million, or 9%, in 2006. The internal revenue growth rate in the Financial segment was 4% and 6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, with the remaining growth in each year resulting from acquisitions. Internal revenue growth in this segment was primarily driven by increased volumes and new clients in the electronic payments businesses along with new client growth and increased sales to existing clients in the banking and credit union core processing businesses and card fulfillment businesses. In 2007, internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by approximately one percentage point due to a decrease in revenues in our home equity loan processing businesses due primarily to a decline in volumes associated with weakness in the mortgage markets in the United States in the second half of 2007. In 2006, internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by approximately one percentage point from a decrease in contract termination fees. Operating income in our Financial segment increased $101 million, or 18%, in 2007 compared to 2006 and decreased $12 million, or 2%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating margins were 22.2%, 19.9% and 22.1% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating margins in 2007 increased 2.3 percentage points compared to 2006 primarily due to higher-margin revenue growth in our core processing and electronic payments businesses and overall operating efficiencies in our bank and credit union core processing and payments businesses resulting primarily from the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered costs. Operating margins in 2006 decreased 2.2 percentage points compared to 2005 and were negatively impacted by a $35 million decrease in higher-margin contract termination fees, an increase of $21 million in share-based compensation expense related to the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, charges totaling $9 million related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending businesses and operating losses associated with our Australia check processing operations. Insurance Revenues in our Insurance segment increased $101 million, or 14%, in 2007 compared to 2006 and $98 million, or 16%, in 2006 compared to 2005. The internal revenue growth rate in this segment was 0% in 2007 and 10% in 2006. The 2007 internal revenue growth rate decreased from 2006 primarily due to a $33 million decrease in flood claims processing revenues and lower pass-through prescription revenue growth in our workers’ compensation businesses. Operating income in our Insurance segment decreased $36 million, or 36%, in 2007 compared to 2006 and increased $15 million, or 18%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating margins were 7.5% in 2007 compared to 13.6% in 2006 and 13.3% in 2005. Operating margins declined in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to a $33 million decrease in higher-margin flood claims processing revenues and charges totaling $4 million related to facility shutdown and employee severance related to the consolidation of operations. Operating margins in our Insurance segment are impacted by the significant increase in revenues in our workers’ compensation businesses, which generate operating margins in the low- to mid-single digits. The inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense negatively impacted operating margins in the Insurance segment by nine percentage points, 14 percentage points and 12 percentage points in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. CheckFree We acquired CheckFree on December 3, 2007 and, as a result, our 2007 operating results include 28 days of CheckFree operations. During this period, revenues totaled $87 million and operating income and operating margin were $14 million and 16.7%, respectively. Included in total expenses for the CheckFree segment was amortization expense from acquired intangible assets totaling $9 million during the 28 day period. 29 Table of Contents Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest expense was $76 million, $41 million and $28 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $35 million increase in interest expense in 2007 was primarily due to the new senior term loan and senior notes borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2007 to finance our acquisition of CheckFree. Because of these new borrowings, which had a combined principal balance of $4.25 billion at December 31, 2007, we expect that interest expense will be significantly higher in 2008 as compared to 2007. The $13 million increase in interest expense in 2006 was due primarily to higher interest rates and increased average borrowings outstanding in 2006 compared to 2005. Interest income was $7 million, $0 and $7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income in 2007 was earned by investing the proceeds from the senior notes borrowings during the period from our receipt of the proceeds until we completed the CheckFree acquisition. The interest income in 2005 was primarily due to increased cash balances resulting from the proceeds we received for the sale of our securities clearing businesses. Realized Gain from Sale of Investments In 2005, we realized a pre-tax gain of $44 million from the sale of 3.2 million shares of common stock of Bisys Group, Inc. In addition, we sold our investment in INTRIA Items, Inc. to our joint venture partner, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $43 million. Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 38.3% in 2007, 37.8% in 2006 and 37.6% in 2005. The effective income tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were favorably impacted, as compared to 2007, primarily by changes in state tax laws, the finalization of various tax returns and a lower tax rate on the sale of investments. We expect that our income tax rate for continuing operations will be approximately 38.5% in 2008. Income from Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations, which includes Fiserv Health, Fiserv ISS, CredStar, Del Mar Database and our securities clearing businesses, totaled $31 million in 2007 and $62 million in 2006 and 2005. The decrease in income from discontinued operations in 2007 was primarily due to $18 million of charges related to disposition activities including retention bonuses, employee severance and other sale related expenses and a $14 million charge at Fiserv Health for employee severance, facility shutdown and other charges to cease an investment in a new technology platform in the health plan management business in the second quarter of 2007. Net Income Per Share-Diluted Net income per share-diluted for 2007 was $2.60 compared to $2.53 in 2006 and $2.70 in 2005. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $2.42 in 2007 compared to $2.19 in 2006 and $2.38 in 2005. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2007 compared to 2006 was negatively impacted by approximately $0.07 per share due to merger and integration costs and intangible amortization expense associated with our acquisition of CheckFree and a $0.01 per share increase in facility shutdown and related costs. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2006 compared to 2005 was negatively impacted by a decrease of $0.29 per share from realized gains on sale of investments in 2005, approximately $0.12 per share from a decrease in contract termination fees in 2006, $0.08 per share of incremental share-based compensation expense in 2006 due to the prospective adoption of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006, and $0.03 per share related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in 2006. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets totaled $0.15 per share, $0.09 per share and $0.07 per share in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 30 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet debt service requirements of $500 million in 2008, including $250 million of our senior notes maturing in April and June of 2008 and $250 million of our senior term loan due in December of 2008; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and proceeds from dispositions during the next twelve months. In the first quarter of 2008, we received proceeds from the dispositions of Fiserv Health and Fiserv ISS totaling approximately $660 million after taxes. As of January 31, 2008, we had $637 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, or operating cash flow, was $564 million in 2007 compared with $542 million in 2006. Operating cash flow in 2007 compared to 2006 was negatively impacted by the payment of $30 million to settle treasury-lock interest rate hedge contracts entered into in connection with the financing of our acquisition of CheckFree. Our capital expenditures, including capitalization of software costs, were $160 million, or 4.1% of total revenues, $163 million, or 4.6% of total revenues, and $141 million, or 4.4% of total revenues, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We purchased treasury stock totaling $469 million, $560 million and $653 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we were authorized by our board of directors to purchase up to 1.8 million additional shares of our common stock. Share repurchases under this authorization are expected to be made through open market transactions as market conditions warrant. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures and to repay debt, rather than to pay dividends. On December 3, 2007, we acquired CheckFree for $4.2 billion, net of cash acquired. To complete the acquisition, we borrowed $2.5 billion under an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks, issued $1.75 billion of senior notes and borrowed under our revolving credit facility. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we used $127 million, $187 million and $510 million, respectively, to acquire other businesses. Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper We maintain a $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. The facility bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate. There are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under this facility. The revolving credit facility, as amended, contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than a specified multiple (ranging between 3.5 and 4.5) of consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments and to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense. The facility expires on March 24, 2011. In 2007, we were in compliance with all debt covenants in this and our other credit facilities, including those contained in our senior unsecured notes. We are authorized to issue up to $500 million of unsecured commercial paper under our commercial paper program. Under this program, we may issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance. The revolving credit facility supports 100% of any outstanding commercial paper. As a result, borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce the amount of credit available under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2007, no commercial paper borrowings were outstanding under this program. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program were $840 million and $452 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The weighted-average variable interest rate on these borrowings was 5.4% at December 31, 2007. 31 Table of Contents Senior Term Loan In December 2007, we borrowed $2.5 billion under an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. This term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate, and matures in December 2012. Scheduled principal payments of $250 million are due in December 2008 and 2009, payments of $375 million are due in December 2010 and 2011, and the remaining principal of $1.25 billion is due in December 2012. The weighted-average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 5.5% at December 31, 2007. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above. Senior Notes In November 2007, we issued $1.25 billion of 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 and $500 million of 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017, which notes pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. In addition, we previously issued $150 million of 4% senior notes, which are due in April 2008, and $100 million of 3% senior notes, which are due in June 2008. Interest Rate Hedge Contracts To manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements (“Treasury Locks”) in 2007 with total notional values of $0.9 billion and maintain interest rate swap agreements (“Swaps”) with total notional values of $1.9 billion and $150 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Swaps effectively fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term loan at a weighted-average rate of approximately 4.5%, prior to financing spreads and related fees. The Swaps have original contract terms of two to five years with expiration dates through September 2012. Upon the issuance of the senior notes in November 2007, we paid $30 million to settle the Treasury Locks. This payment was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes of $11 million, and will be recognized as interest expense over the terms of the senior notes. In addition, we maintain fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements on the $150 million 4% senior notes, with a variable interest rate of 6.0% at December 31, 2007. 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility In November 2007, we entered into a 364-day revolving credit facility under which borrowings were conditioned upon our full draw of available borrowings under our $900 million revolving credit facility described above and prepayments were required in the event of certain asset sales or other transactions. No borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility were outstanding at December 31, 2007 and we terminated this facility in February 2008. Shelf Registration Statement In 2007, we filed a “shelf” registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, or a combination thereof. Each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay indebtedness or for working capital, acquisitions or general corporate purposes. As discussed above, in 2007, we issued $1.75 billion of senior unsecured notes under the shelf registration statement. 32 Table of Contents Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing indebtedness and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our capital stock. As of December 31, 2007, we had a credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a negative outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating applicable to the senior notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease, the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 2.0%. In no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes or will the total increase in the per annum interest rate be more than 2.0% above the original interest rate. The interest rates on any series of senior notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes become rated A3 (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody’s and A- (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. The interest component of long-term debt obligations and minimum operating lease payments are reported on a pre-tax basis. The following table details our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2007: (In millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years Long-term debt including interest $ 6,744 $ 751 $ 1,043 $ 4,068 $ 882 Minimum operating lease payments 424 114 164 85 61 Purchase obligations 28 22 5 1 — Income tax obligations 60 9 27 21 3 Total $ 7,256 $ 896 $ 1,239 $ 4,175 $ 946 33 Table of Contents QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) (In millions, except per share data) Quarters First Second Third Fourth Total 2007 Revenues: Processing and services $ 646 $ 655 $ 652 $ 740 $ 2,693 Product 298 284 277 370 1,229 Total revenues 944 939 929 1,110 3,922 Expenses: Cost of processing and services 403 399 393 463 1,658 Cost of product 236 225 223 295 979 Selling, general and administrative 128 133 123 171 555 Total expenses 767 757 739 929 3,192 Operating income 177 182 190 181 730 Interest expense, net (9 ) (11 ) (13 ) (36 ) (69 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 168 171 177 145 661 Income tax provision 65 66 67 55 253 Income from continuing operations 103 105 110 90 408 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 11 3 11 6 31 Net income $ 114 $ 108 $ 121 $ 96 $ 439 Net income per share—basic: Continuing operations $ 0.60 $ 0.63 $ 0.67 $ 0.55 $ 2.45 Discontinued operations 0.07 0.02 0.06 0.04 0.19 Total $ 0.67 $ 0.65 $ 0.73 $ 0.59 $ 2.64 Net income per share—diluted: Continuing operations $ 0.59 $ 0.62 $ 0.66 $ 0.54 $ 2.42 Discontinued operations 0.07 0.02 0.06 0.04 0.19 Total $ 0.66 $ 0.64 $ 0.73 $ 0.58 $ 2.60 34 Table of Contents QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) (In millions, except per share data) Quarters First Second Third Fourth Total 2006 Revenues: Processing and services $ 622 $ 603 $ 631 $ 632 $ 2,488 Product 250 263 267 298 1,078 Total revenues 872 866 898 930 3,566 Expenses: Cost of processing and services 387 391 393 407 1,578 Cost of product 195 195 216 233 839 Selling, general and administrative 118 117 120 129 484 Total expenses 700 703 729 769 2,901 Operating income 172 163 169 161 665 Interest expense, net (8 ) (10 ) (12 ) (11 ) (41 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 164 153 157 150 624 Income tax provision 63 56 59 58 236 Income from continuing operations 101 97 98 92 388 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 15 21 12 14 62 Net income $ 116 $ 118 $ 110 $ 106 $ 450 Net income per share—basic: Continuing operations $ 0.57 $ 0.55 $ 0.56 $ 0.53 $ 2.22 Discontinued operations 0.08 0.12 0.07 0.08 0.35 Total $ 0.65 $ 0.67 $ 0.63 $ 0.62 $ 2.57 Net income per share—diluted: Continuing operations $ 0.56 $ 0.55 $ 0.56 $ 0.52 $ 2.19 Discontinued operations 0.08 0.12 0.07 0.08 0.35 Total $ 0.64 $ 0.66 $ 0.63 $ 0.61 $ 2.53 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on investments and borrowings. We actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management. Fiserv ISS, which is included in discontinued operations, accepts retirement account deposits from clients and invests the funds in securities, substantially all of which are rated within the highest investment grade categories for securities. Fiserv ISS utilizes simulation models for measuring and monitoring interest rate risk and market value of portfolio equities. A formal asset and liability committee meets quarterly to review interest rate risks, capital ratios, liquidity levels, portfolio diversification, credit risk ratings and adherence to investment policies and guidelines. We do not believe significant changes in interest rates would have a material impact on our operating results from discontinued operations or our financial condition. 35 Table of Contents We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating-rate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts. We currently use interest rate swaps to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs. Generally, under these swaps, we agree with a counter-party to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount. Based on our long-term debt with variable interest rates as of December 31, 2007, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2008 by approximately $10 million. We believe the risks associated with financial instruments at December 31, 2007 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.",2023-12-30 20:20:24.525948
798354,FI,FISERV INC,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows: • Recent developments. This section provides a general description of recent events that are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. • Critical accounting policies. This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. • Recent accounting pronouncements. This section provides a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. • Non-GAAP financial measure. This section provides a discussion of internal revenue growth, a non-GAAP financial measure that we use in this report. • Results of operations. This section contains an analysis of our results of operations by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2008 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2007, and comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2007 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2006. 20 • Liquidity and capital resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments as of December 31, 2008. Recent Developments On July 14, 2008, we completed the sale of a 51% interest in substantially all of the businesses in our Insurance Services segment (“Fiserv Insurance”) to Trident IV, LP. We recognized an after-tax loss of $0.34 per share from the sale. This loss on sale was comprised of a pre-tax loss of $21 million and an income tax provision of $34 million ($0.21 per share) which was incurred on sale due to a significantly lower tax basis in the stock compared to the book basis of the net assets sold. Upon closing, we received cash proceeds of approximately $500 million and a $30 million note due in 2018. Our remaining 49% ownership interest in Fiserv Insurance is accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereby our investment was established based on our historical basis, is adjusted for our share of undistributed net income or net loss, and is reported within other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Beginning on July 15, 2008, we no longer consolidate revenues and expenses of Fiserv Insurance and report our 49% share of net income as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income. On February 4, 2008, we completed the first of two transactions to dispose of our Investment Support Services segment (“Fiserv ISS”) by selling Fiserv Trust Company and the accounts of our institutional retirement plan and advisor services operations to TD AMERITRADE Online Holdings, Inc. for approximately $200 million, net of income taxes and transaction costs. In the second transaction, Robert Beriault Holdings, Inc. has agreed to acquire the remaining accounts and net capital of Fiserv ISS, including the investment administration services business which provides back office and custody services for individual retirement accounts. This portion of the Fiserv ISS disposition remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval by the FDIC. On January 10, 2008, we completed the sale of a majority of our health businesses (“Fiserv Health”) to UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc. for approximately $480 million, net of income taxes and transaction costs. The financial results of Fiserv Health and Fiserv ISS are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Critical Accounting Policies General Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require a significant amount of judgment. We use the information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definite-lived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. 21 We review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (“SFAS 142”). SFAS 142 requires us to perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge. Additionally, we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2008 determined that the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not impaired. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial statements. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized when the related services have been rendered. Revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Other We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than operating leases. We use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates, managing our ratio of fixed to floating-rate long-term debt and foreign exchange rate risks. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the anticipated adoption dates, which is incorporated herein by reference. Non-GAAP Financial Measure In this report, we refer to internal revenue growth percentage, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We use internal revenue growth percentage to monitor and evaluate our performance, and it is presented in this report because we believe that it allows shareholders to understand the portion of our revenue growth that is attributed to acquired companies as compared to internal revenue growth. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered to be a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The method that we use to calculate internal revenue growth percentage is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 22 Internal revenue growth percentage is measured as the increase or decrease in total revenues for the current period less “acquired revenue from acquisitions” divided by total revenues from the prior period plus “acquired revenue from acquisitions.” “Acquired revenue from acquisitions” represents pre-acquisition revenue of acquired companies for the prior period. Internal revenue growth percentage is calculated as follows: Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2008 2007 2007 2006 Financial Segment Total revenues $ 2,144 $ 2,050 $ 2,050 $ 1,987 Acquired revenue from acquisitions — 132 — 16 Total $ 2,144 $ 2,182 $ 2,050 $ 2,003 Internal revenue growth (decline) $ (38 ) $ 47 Internal revenue growth percentage (2 )% 2 % Payments Segment Total revenues $ 2,131 $ 1,070 $ 1,070 $ 863 Acquired revenue from acquisitions — 941 — 120 Total $ 2,131 $ 2,011 $ 1,070 $ 983 Internal revenue growth $ 120 $ 87 Internal revenue growth percentage 6 % 9 % Results of Operations Business Segments We acquired CheckFree Corporation (“CheckFree”) on December 3, 2007. In connection with the integration of CheckFree and the significant expansion of our payments related businesses, along with associated organizational changes, we reclassified our reporting segments for all periods presented to align them with how our chief operating decision maker currently manages the business. As a result, effective January 1, 2008, our operations consist of the following business segments: Financial Institution Services (“Financial”), Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”), Insurance Services (“Insurance”) and Corporate and Other. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing services, item processing services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Payments segment provides products and services that address a range of technology needs for the financial services industry, including: Internet banking, electronic bill payment, electronic funds transfer and debit processing, fraud and risk management capabilities, card and print personalization services, check imaging, and investment account processing services for separately managed accounts. In 2008, we completed the sale of a 51% interest in substantially all of the businesses in the Insurance segment. The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate overhead expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations. Components of Revenues and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Processing and Services Processing and services revenues, which in 2008 represented 76% of our consolidated revenues, are primarily generated from account and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been rendered. Processing and services revenues are most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly 23 associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenues, which in 2008 represented 24% of our consolidated revenues, are primarily derived from integrated print and card production, prescription product and software licenses. Prior to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance on July 14, 2008, prescription product revenues were recognized on a gross basis to include the prescription price. Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and prescription products; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. Results of Operations The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenues and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

The increase in total revenues during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the result of increased processing and services revenues from our acquisition of CheckFree in December 2007, partially offset by decreased revenues in our Insurance segment as a result of our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008. As a result of this transaction, the revenues of Fiserv Insurance are no longer included in our consolidated revenues beginning July 15, 2008, but are included for all historical periods. The increase in total revenues during 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to increased prescription product revenues in our Insurance segment and increased processing and services revenues from our acquisition of CheckFree. Revenues in our Financial segment increased $94 million, or 5%, in 2008 and $63 million, or 3%, in 2007 compared to the prior year periods. The revenue increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to incremental processing and services revenues from our acquisition of CheckFree. The revenue increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily driven by new client growth and increased sales to existing clients in our banking and credit union account processing businesses. Internal revenue declined 2% in our Financial segment during 2008 and increased 2% in 2007. Internal revenues were negatively impacted by three percentage points and one percentage point in 2008 and 2007, respectively, due to the significant downturn in the U.S. mortgage markets which resulted in a decline in home-equity processing revenues of $70 million and $23 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, the internal revenue growth rate in our Financial segment during 2008 was negatively impacted by slower discretionary spending by our financial institution clients resulting in reduced higher-margin revenue, such as license fees and associated professional services. Revenues in our Payments segment increased $1.06 billion, or 99%, in 2008 and $207 million, or 24%, in 2007 compared to the prior year periods. These increases were primarily due to incremental processing and services revenue from our acquisition of CheckFree. The internal revenue growth percentages in our Payments segment of 6% and 9% in 2008 and 2007, respectively, were primarily driven by new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our electronic payments businesses, including our expedited bill payment and electronic funds transfer processing businesses, along with solid growth in our output solutions businesses. Revenues in our Insurance segment decreased $291 million, or 36%, in 2008 and increased $98 million, or 14%, in 2007 compared to the prior year periods. Revenues declined in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008. The revenue increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to our acquisition of a workers’ compensation transaction processing business in the third quarter of 2007, partially offset by a $33 million decrease in higher-margin flood claims processing revenues. 25 Total Expenses Total expenses increased $691 million, or 22%, in 2008 and $281 million, or 10%, in 2007 compared to the prior year periods. The increase in total expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to our acquisition of CheckFree, partially offset by a decrease in expenses in our Insurance segment caused by our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in 2008. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 58.0% in 2008 from 61.4% in 2007 and 63.8% in 2006. These decreases were primarily due to higher-margin processing revenues associated with our acquisition of CheckFree and overall improvements in operating efficiencies as a result of improved business mix and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue increased to 81.7% in 2008 from 79.7% in 2007 and 77.8% in 2006. The increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to a $94 million increase in prescription product costs during the first half of 2008 prior to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, which generated historical operating margins in the mid-single digits due primarily to the inclusion of prescription product costs in both product revenues and cost of product. In addition, cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2008 was negatively impacted by a $45 million increase in postage pass-through revenue and expenses in our output solutions businesses. The increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily driven by an $82 million increase in prescription product costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $293 million and $75 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, compared to the prior year periods and increased as a percentage of revenues to 17.6% in 2008 from 13.9% in 2007 and 13.1% in 2006. The increases in 2008 compared to 2007 were primarily due to our acquisition of CheckFree, partially offset by a decrease in expenses in our Insurance segment resulting from our sale of a 51% interest in that business. As a result of our acquisition of CheckFree, amortization expense for acquired intangible assets included in selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $79 million in 2008 compared to 2007, and incremental merger costs, including integration project management, retention bonuses and other expenses, were $37 million and $8 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating Income and Operating Margin Years Ended December 31, (In millions) Financial Payments Insurance Corporateand Other Total Operating income: 2008 $ 535 $ 579 $ 44 $ (268 ) $ 890 2007 515 253 78 (107 ) 739 2006 421 202 110 (66 ) 667 Operating income growth (decline): 2008 $ 20 $ 326 $ (34 ) $ (161 ) $ 151 2008 percentage 4 % 129 % (44 )% 20 % 2007 $ 94 $ 51 $ (32 ) $ (41 ) $ 72 2007 percentage 22 % 25 % (29 )% 11 % Operating margin: 2008 24.9 % 27.2 % 8.7 % 18.8 % 2007 25.1 % 23.6 % 9.7 % 19.0 % 2006 21.2 % 23.4 % 15.6 % 18.8 % Operating margin growth (decline):(1) 2008 (0.2 )% 3.6 % (1.0 )% (0.2 )% 2007 3.9 % 0.2 % (5.9 )% 0.2 % (1) Represents the percentage point improvement or decline in operating margin. 26 Total operating income increased $151 million, or 20%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating margin decreased 0.2 percentage points to 18.8% in 2008 from 19.0% in 2007. The overall increase in operating income during 2008 was primarily due to our acquisition of CheckFree in December 2007. Our operating margin in 2008 of 18.8% was negatively impacted by an increase in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets and merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree, and by declining operating margins in the Insurance segment. In addition, the strong results in our Payments segment positively impacted overall operating margins, partially offset by the slight negative impact of our Financial segment in 2008. Total operating income increased $72 million, or 11%, in 2007 compared to 2006. Operating margin increased 0.2 percentage points to 19.0% in 2007 from 18.8% in 2006. Operating income and margin in 2007 as compared to 2006 were positively impacted by increases in higher-margin revenues in our electronic payments businesses, continued strong operating results in our bank and credit union account processing businesses, the acquisition of CheckFree, and improvements in overall operating efficiencies. These positive factors were partially offset by a decline in operating margin in the Insurance segment, primarily due to a $33 million decrease in higher-margin flood claims processing revenues. Operating income in our Financial segment increased $20 million, or 4%, in 2008 and $94 million, or 22%, in 2007 compared to the prior year periods. Operating margins were 24.9%, 25.1% and 21.2% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and declined 20 basis points in 2008 and increased 390 basis points in 2007. Operating income and margin in 2008 as compared to 2007 were negatively impacted by a $70 million decline in home-equity processing revenues in our lending business and decreases in higher-margin revenues, such as software license fees and associated professional services. Operating income and margin in 2007 as compared to 2006 increased significantly due primarily to higher-margin revenue growth in our bank and credit union account processing businesses, improved business mix and overall operating efficiencies resulting primarily from the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. Operating income in our Payments segment increased $326 million, or 129%, and $51 million, or 25%, in 2008 and 2007 compared to the prior year periods. Operating margins were 27.2%, 23.6% and 23.4% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and increased 360 basis points in 2008 and 20 basis points in 2007. The significant increases in operating income and margin in 2008 compared to 2007 were driven primarily by higher-margin revenues and cost synergies associated with our acquisition of CheckFree, growth in our other electronic payments businesses, such as our expedited bill payment and electronic funds transfer businesses, and improved operating leverage and scale efficiencies in our transaction processing businesses within our Payments segment. Operating income in our Insurance segment decreased $34 million, or 44%, in 2008 and $32 million, or 29%, in 2007 compared to the prior year periods. Operating margins were 8.7%, 9.7% and 15.6% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and declined 100 basis points in 2008 and 590 basis points in 2007. The decrease in operating income in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in 2008. The decreases in operating income and margin in 2007 compared to 2006 were primarily due to a $33 million decrease in higher-margin flood claims processing revenues. The operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment increased $161 million in 2008 and $41 million in 2007 compared to the prior year periods. These increases were primarily due to incremental amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $119 million and $15 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and merger and integration related items associated with our acquisition of CheckFree totaling $59 million and $11 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest Expense Interest expense was $260 million, $76 million and $41 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increases in interest expense were primarily due to the new senior term loan and senior notes borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2007 to finance our $4.4 billion acquisition of CheckFree. 27 Interest Income Interest income was $13 million, $7 million and $0 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest income in 2008 was primarily earned by investing the proceeds from our business dispositions. Interest income in 2007 was primarily earned by investing the proceeds from the senior notes borrowings during the period from our receipt of the proceeds until we completed the acquisition of CheckFree. Loss on Sale of Businesses In 2008, we recognized a $24 million pre-tax loss which was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 45.1% in 2008, 38.2% in 2007 and 37.8% in 2006. The higher effective income tax rate in 2008 was primarily due to a $34 million income tax provision related to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance which was due to a significantly lower tax basis in the stock compared to the book basis of the net assets sold. The tax provision related to sale of businesses increased the effective income tax rate in 2008 by 6.9 percentage points, from 38.2% to 45.1%. We expect that our income tax rate for continuing operations will be approximately 38.5% in 2009. Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate Due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008, we record our 49% share of Fiserv Insurance’s net income, $6 million in 2008, as income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate. Income from Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations totaled $223 million, $25 million and $60 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in income from discontinued operations in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to after-tax gains of $230 million related to the sales of a portion of Fiserv ISS and all of Fiserv Health. The decrease in income from discontinued operations in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to sale related expenses. Net Income Per Share—Diluted Net income per share-diluted for 2008 was $3.49 compared to $2.60 in 2007 and $2.53 in 2006. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $2.12 in 2008 compared to $2.45 in 2007 and $2.20 in 2006. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2008 compared to 2007 was negatively impacted by a $0.46 per share increase in amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, a $0.35 per share after-tax loss on the sale of businesses which includes the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, and $0.14 per share due to an increase in merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree, partially offset by a decrease in facility shutdown and related costs that were incurred in 2007. 28 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations, our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008 of $232 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $784 million. Years EndedDecember 31, Increase(Decrease) (In millions) 2008 2007 $ % Income from continuing operations $ 346 $ 414 $ (68 ) Depreciation and amortization 362 186 176 Share-based compensation 34 23 11 Loss on sale of businesses 24 — 24 Income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate (6 ) — (6 ) Settlement of interest rate hedge contracts — (30 ) 30 Net changes in working capital and other 15 (28 ) 43 Operating cash flow $ 775 $ 565 $ 210 37 % Our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, or operating cash flow, increased $210 million, or 37%, to $775 million in 2008 from $565 million in 2007. This significant increase was primarily due to strong operating cash flow associated with our acquisition of CheckFree and overall improvements in working capital of $43 million. Depreciation and amortization increased $176 million in 2008 primarily due to a $119 million increase in intangible amortization associated with acquisitions. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures increased $43 million to $199 million in 2008 compared to $156 million in 2007, due primarily to capital expenditures associated with CheckFree. Our capital expenditures were less than 5% of total revenues in 2008. Share Repurchases We purchased $441 million, $469 million and $560 million of our common stock in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. On July 2, 2008, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. As of December 31, 2008, we had 1.2 million shares remaining under our authorization. Indebtedness December 31, (In millions) 2008 2007 Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 4,105 $ 5,405 In 2008, we used our operating cash flow and the proceeds from business dispositions primarily to repay $1.3 billion of debt, which reduced our outstanding debt (including current maturities) to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2008. Our long-term debt currently consists primarily of $2.25 billion under our unsecured senior term loan facility, $1.75 billion under senior notes borrowings, and $100 million under our $900 million revolving credit facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants in 2008. Revolving Credit Facility We maintain a $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. The facility bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate. There are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under this facility. The revolving credit 29 facility, as amended, contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than a specified multiple (ranging between 3.5 and 4.5) of consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments, and to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense. The facility expires on March 24, 2011. The weighted-average variable interest rate on revolving credit facility borrowings was 1.9% at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, our outstanding borrowings on this facility were $100 million and available borrowings were $784 million. Senior Term Loan In December 2007, we borrowed $2.5 billion under an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. This term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate and matures in November 2012. A scheduled principal payment of $250 million is due in December 2009, payments of $375 million are due in December 2010 and 2011, and the remaining principal of $1.25 billion is due in November 2012. The weighted-average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 2.1% at December 31, 2008. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above. Senior Notes In November 2007, we issued $1.25 billion of 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 and $500 million of 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017, which pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The interest rates applicable to these notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit: our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; our ability to create or assume liens; and our ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. Interest Rate Hedge Contracts To manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we maintain a series of interest rate swap agreements (“Swaps”) with total notional values of $1.75 billion at December 31, 2008. The Swaps effectively fix interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weighted-average rate of approximately 4.5% prior to financing spreads and related fees. The Swaps have expiration dates through September 2012. Shelf Registration Statement In 2007, we filed a “shelf” registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, or a combination thereof. Each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay indebtedness or for working capital, acquisitions or general corporate purposes. Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing indebtedness and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2008, we had a credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a negative outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. 30 The interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 2.0%. In no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes or will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed 2.0% above the original interest rate. The interest rates on any series of notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes becomes rated A3 (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody’s and A- (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. The interest component of long-term debt obligations and minimum operating lease payments are reported on a pre-tax basis. The following table details our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2008: (In millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years Long-term debt including interest $ 5,051 $ 471 $ 1,243 $ 2,701 $ 636 Minimum operating lease payments 337 94 132 67 44 Purchase obligations 26 20 5 1 — Income tax obligations 77 19 47 7 4 Total $ 5,491 $ 604 $ 1,427 $ 2,776 $ 684 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on investments and borrowings and foreign currency risk. We actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management. In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable merchants. These subscriber funds are generally invested in short-term instruments that are guaranteed by the United States government. Subscriber funds, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment activity, and totaled approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2008. Based upon interest rates and subscriber funds balances at December 31, 2008, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual income from continuing operations by approximately $10 million. Fiserv ISS, which is included in discontinued operations, is a custodian of self-directed individual retirement accounts. It accepts retirement account deposits from clients and invests the funds in securities, substantially all of which are rated within the highest investment grade categories for securities. Fiserv ISS utilizes simulation models for measuring and monitoring interest rate risk and market value of portfolio equities. A formal Asset Liability Committee meets quarterly to review interest rate risks, capital ratios, liquidity levels, portfolio diversification, credit risk ratings and adherence to investment policies and guidelines. We do not believe significant changes in interest rates would have a material impact on our operating results from discontinued operations or our financial condition. We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating-rate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts. We currently use interest rate swaps to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs. Generally, under these swaps, we agree with a 31 counter-party to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount. Based on our long-term debt with variable interest rates as of December 31, 2008, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2009 by approximately $10 million. We believe the risks associated with financial instruments at December 31, 2008 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We conduct business in the U.S. and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2008, there would not have been a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position.",2023-12-30 20:20:23.001936

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows: • Critical accounting policies. This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. • Results of operations. This section contains an analysis of our results of operations by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2009 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2008, and comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2008 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2007. • Liquidity and capital resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies General Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial 19 Table of Contents statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Accounting guidance requires us to perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and we compare the aggregate fair values to our market capitalization as an assessment of the appropriateness of our fair value measurements. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2009 determined that our goodwill was not impaired. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Based on our impairment assessments in 2009, we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transaction-based fees. Deferred revenues consist primarily of advance billings for services. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Other We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than operating leases. We use derivative financial instruments for managing 20 Table of Contents our exposure to changes in interest rates, managing our ratio of fixed to floating-rate debt and foreign exchange rate risks. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Results of Operations Business Segments Our ongoing operations are comprised of the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment, Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment and Corporate and Other segment. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing services, item processing services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and settlement, electronic funds transfer, and debit processing products and services to meet the electronic transaction processing needs of the financial services industry. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, Internet banking, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate overhead expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations. In July 2008, we completed the sale of a 51% interest in substantially all of the businesses in the Insurance Services (“Insurance”) segment. Components of Revenues and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Processing and Services Processing and services revenues, which in 2009 represented approximately 80% of our consolidated revenues, are primarily generated from account and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenues are most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenues, which in 2009 represented approximately 20% of our consolidated revenues, are primarily derived from integrated print and card production (15%) and software licenses (5%). Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. Prior to our sale of a 51% interest in substantially all of the businesses in our Insurance segment (“Fiserv Insurance”) on July 14, 2008, product revenues and cost of product also included prescription related items which were recognized on a gross basis. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenues and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

Total Revenues Years Ended December 31, (In millions) Financial Payments Insurance Corporateand Other Total Total revenues: 2009 $ 1,942 $ 2,160 $ — $ (25 ) $ 4,077 2008 1,992 2,131 513 (49 ) 4,587 2007 1,830 1,070 804 (27 ) 3,677 2009 Revenue growth (decline) $ (50 ) $ 29 $ (513 ) $ 24 $ (510 ) 2009 Revenue growth (decline) percentage (3 %) 1 % (100 %) (11 %) 2008 Revenue growth (decline) $ 162 $ 1,061 $ (291 ) $ (22 ) $ 910 2008 Revenue growth (decline) percentage 9 % 99 % (36 %) 25 % Total revenues decreased $510 million, or 11%, in 2009 compared to 2008, and increased $910 million, or 25%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in total revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to 22 Table of Contents our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008, which resulted in a decrease of $513 million, or 11%. As a result of this transaction, the revenues of Fiserv Insurance are no longer included in our consolidated revenues beginning July 15, 2008. In addition, 2009 revenues were impacted by a 1% increase in revenues in our Payments segment and a 3% decline in revenues in our Financial segment. Incremental revenue from acquired companies totaled $27 million, or approximately 1%, in 2009. The increase in total revenues in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the result of increased processing and services revenues from our acquisition of CheckFree Corporation (“CheckFree”) in December 2007, partially offset by decreased revenues in our Insurance segment as a result of the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. Revenues in our Financial segment decreased $50 million, or 3%, in 2009 and increased $162 million, or 9%, in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. Financial segment revenues in 2009 were negatively impacted by 2 percentage points, or $35 million, due to lower contract termination fee revenues, which declined from $42 million in 2008 to $7 million in 2009. The businesses in our Financial segment generally enter into three to five year contracts with clients that contain early contract termination fees. These fees are primarily generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary significantly from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term a contract is terminated. In addition, revenues in our Financial segment were negatively impacted by lower discretionary spending by our financial institution clients and a decline in item processing revenues. The increase in Financial segment revenues in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to incremental processing and services revenues from our acquisition of CheckFree. Revenues in our Payments segment increased $29 million, or 1%, in 2009 and increased $1.06 billion, or 99%, in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. The revenue growth in our Payments segment during 2009 was primarily driven by new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our bill payment and electronic funds transfer businesses, partially offset by revenue declines in our investment services business from a reduction in the number of accounts processed as a result of the volatility in the U.S. equity markets and a decline in product revenues due primarily to lower software license revenues. Revenue increases in our Payments segment during 2008 were primarily due to incremental processing and services revenue from our acquisition of CheckFree. Total Expenses Total expenses decreased $548 million, or 15%, in 2009 and increased $738 million, or 25%, in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in total expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008, which resulted in a decrease in total expenses of $469 million, or 13%. The increase in total expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the result of our acquisition of CheckFree, partially offset by decreased expenses due to the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 55.4% in 2009 from 56.3% in 2008 and 59.2% in 2007. The decreases in both 2009 and 2008 compared to the prior years were favorably impacted by overall improvements in operating efficiencies as a result of improved business mix and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. The decrease in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to higher-margin processing revenues associated with our acquisition of CheckFree. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 71.7% in 2009 compared to 81.7% in 2008 and 79.7% in 2007. The lower percentage of revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, which generated historical overall operating margins of less than 10 percent primarily due to the inclusion of prescription product costs in both product revenues and cost of product. Prescription product costs totaled $312 million and $449 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, compared to no such costs in 2009. 23 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $62 million, or 8%, in 2009 and increased $300 million, or 58%, in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was impacted by a decrease of $36 million, or 4%, from our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. In addition, the decline in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009 was due to a $36 million positive impact resulting from lower merger related expenses and the reversal of a pre-acquisition liability associated with our acquisition of CheckFree, partially offset by a $20 million increase in employee severance and related expenses. The increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to our acquisition of CheckFree, including increases in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets and merger related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in expenses from our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. Operating Income and Operating Margin Years Ended December 31, (In millions) Financial Payments Insurance Corporateand Other Total Operating income: 2009 $ 569 $ 617 $ — $ (240 ) $ 946 2008 545 579 44 (260 ) 908 2007 506 253 78 (101 ) 736 Operating income growth (decline): 2009 $ 24 $ 38 $ (44 ) $ 20 $ 38 2009 percentage 4 % 7 % (100 %) 4 % 2008 $ 39 $ 326 $ (34 ) $ (159 ) $ 172 2008 percentage 8 % 129 % (44 %) 23 % Operating margin: 2009 29.3 % 28.6 % — 23.2 % 2008 27.4 % 27.2 % 8.7 % 19.8 % 2007 27.6 % 23.6 % 9.7 % 20.0 % Operating margin growth (decline):(1) 2009 1.9 % 1.4 % — 3.4 % 2008 (0.2 %) 3.6 % (1.0 %) (0.2 %) (1) Represents the percentage point improvement or decline in operating margin. Total operating income increased $38 million, or 4%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Operating margin increased to 23.2% in 2009 from 19.8% in 2008. Operating margins improved by 340 basis points in 2009 due primarily to strong operating margin expansion in both the Financial and Payments segments, the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure, lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree, and the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, which historically generated lower operating margins. These positive factors were partially offset by decreases in higher-margin contract termination fees. Total operating income increased $172 million, or 23%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating margin decreased to 19.8% in 2008 from 20.0% in 2007. The overall increase in operating income during 2008 was primarily due to our acquisition of CheckFree in December 2007. Our operating margin in 2008 of 19.8% was negatively impacted by an increase in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets and merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree, and by declining operating margins in the Insurance segment, partially offset by strong results in our Payments segment. Operating income in our Financial segment increased $24 million, or 4%, in 2009 and $39 million, or 8%, in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. Operating margins were 29.3%, 27.4% and 27.6% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and increased 190 basis points in 2009 and declined 20 basis points in 2008. The improvements in operating income and operating margin in 2009 were primarily due to overall improvements in operating efficiencies, cost reductions, improved business mix, and scale efficiencies in our bank and credit 24 Table of Contents union account processing businesses. These positive factors were partially offset by the negative impact of a $35 million decrease in higher-margin contract termination fee revenues. The increase in operating income during 2008 was primarily due to our acquisition of CheckFree in December 2007. Operating income in our Payments segment increased $38 million, or 7%, in 2009 and $326 million, or 129%, in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. Operating margins were 28.6%, 27.2% and 23.6% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and increased 140 basis points in 2009 and 360 basis points in 2008. The Payments segment operating income and margin in 2009 and 2008 were positively impacted by cost savings associated with the integration of CheckFree and growth in higher-margin revenues resulting in improved operating leverage and scale efficiencies in our transaction processing electronic payments businesses, partially offset by a decline in software license revenues in 2009. In addition, the increases in operating income and margin in 2008 compared to 2007 were impacted by higher-margin revenues associated with our acquisition of CheckFree. The operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment decreased $20 million in 2009 and increased $159 million in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. The operating loss decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a $36 million positive impact resulting from lower merger related expenses and the reversal of a pre-acquisition liability associated with our acquisition of CheckFree, partially offset by a $20 million increase in employee severance and related expenses and increased spending for several company-wide initiatives in 2009. The operating loss increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to our acquisition of CheckFree resulting in increases in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets of $117 million and merger related expenses of $29 million. Interest Expense Interest expense was $220 million, $260 million and $76 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $40 million decrease in interest expense in 2009 was primarily due to decreases in total outstanding borrowings and interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008. The $184 million increase in interest expense in 2008 was primarily due to new senior term loan and senior notes borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2007 to finance our $4.4 billion acquisition of CheckFree. Interest Income Interest income was $8 million, $13 million and $7 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest income in 2008 was higher than 2009 and 2007 due primarily to interest income earned from investing the proceeds of several business dispositions. Loss on Sale of Businesses In 2008, we recognized a $21 million pre-tax loss due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 37.2% in 2009, 44.9% in 2008, and 38.2% in 2007. The higher effective income tax rate in 2008 was due primarily to income taxes associated with our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. In addition, our effective income tax rate in 2009 includes the positive impact of a tax settlement. The significant items impacting our effective income tax rates for continuing operations were as follows: 25 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Statutory federal, state and foreign income tax provisions, net 38.1 % 38.3 % 38.2 % Sale of Fiserv Insurance(1) — 6.6 % — Tax settlement(2) (0.9 %) — — Effective income tax rate 37.2 % 44.9 % 38.2 % (1) Represents a $34 million income tax provision related to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. (2) Represents a $7 million income tax benefit recognized in conjunction with the final settlement of a CheckFree purchase accounting income tax reserve. Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate Beginning in July 2008, we record our 49% share of Fiserv Insurance’s net income, $12 million in 2009 and $6 million in 2008, as income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate. Income from Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations totaled $3 million, $211 million and $27 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Income from discontinued operations includes after-tax gains from the sale of businesses of $25 million and $229 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net Income Per Share—Diluted from Continuing Operations Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $3.04 in 2009 compared to $2.20 in 2008 and $2.44 in 2007. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2009 compared to 2008 was positively impacted by operating income growth in 2009, a $0.34 per share after-tax loss on the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance recognized in 2008, and a $0.14 per share decrease in merger related expenses in 2009 associated with our acquisition of CheckFree. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2008 compared to 2007 was negatively impacted by a $0.45 per share increase in amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, the loss on the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, and a $0.11 per share increase in merger related expenses. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.58, $0.57 and $0.12 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations, our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009 of $363 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $870 million at December 31, 2009.

Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were $198 million, less than 5% of our total revenues, in 2009 and 2008. In 2009, we received net cash of $132 million related to discontinued operations, including proceeds from the sale of businesses and contingent purchase price related to our 2008 sale of a portion of Fiserv ISS. In the third quarter of 2009, Fiserv Insurance, of which we own 49%, refinanced its outstanding debt. In conjunction with the refinancing, we loaned Fiserv Insurance $67 million, with interest payable quarterly and the principal due in 2013. In December 2009, Fiserv Insurance repaid $10 million of this loan. Share Repurchases We purchased $175 million, $441 million and $469 million of our common stock in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. On May 20, 2009, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5 million shares of our common stock. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. As of December 31, 2009, we had 2.2 million shares remaining under this authorization. On February 24, 2010, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5 million additional shares of our common stock. Indebtedness December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 3,641 $ 4,105 In 2009, we used a portion of our operating cash flow to repay $475 million of debt, which reduced our total outstanding debt, including current maturities, to $3.64 billion at December 31, 2009. Our long-term debt currently consists primarily of $1.88 billion under our unsecured senior term loan facility and $1.75 billion under senior notes borrowings. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in 2009. Senior Term Loan In December 2007, we entered into an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. Our term loan borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate and mature in November 2012. Principal payments of $255 million and $375 million are due in December 2010 and 2011, respectively, and the remaining principal of $1.25 billion is due in November 2012. The weighted-average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 0.9% at December 31, 2009. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below. Revolving Credit Facility We maintain a $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. The facility bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate. There are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements. The revolving credit facility, as amended, contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments, and to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense. The facility expires on March 24, 2011. As of December 31, 2009, we issued letters of credit totaling $30 million under this facility and our available borrowings were $870 million. 27 Table of Contents Senior Notes In November 2007, we issued $1.25 billion of 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 and $500 million of 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017, which pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The interest rates applicable to these notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit: our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; our ability to create or assume liens; and our ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. Interest Rate Hedge Contracts To manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we maintain a series of interest rate swap agreements (“Swaps”) with total notional values of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2009. The Swaps effectively fix interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weighted-average rate of approximately 4.8%, prior to financing spreads and related fees, and have expiration dates through September 2012. Shelf Registration Statement In 2007, we filed a “shelf” registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, or a combination thereof. Each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital, acquisitions or general corporate purposes. Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2009, we had a credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a negative outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 2.0%. In no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes or will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed 2.0% above the original interest rate. The interest rates on any series of notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes becomes rated A3 (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody’s and A- (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. 28 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency risk. We actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management. In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable merchants. These subscriber funds are generally invested in short-term instruments that are guaranteed by the United States government. Subscriber funds, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment activity, and totaled approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2009. Based on interest rates and subscriber funds balances at December 31, 2009, a 1% increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual income from continuing operations by approximately $15 million, and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero, our annual income from continuing operations would decrease by less than $2 million. We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating-rate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts. We currently use interest rate swaps, with total notional values of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2009, to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs. Generally, under these swaps, we agree with a counter-party to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount. Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of December 31, 2009, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2010 by less than $10 million. We conduct business in the U.S. and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2009, there would not have been a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position. 29 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:20:22.152787
798354,FI,FISERV INC,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows: • Overview. This section contains background information on our company and the services and products that we provide, our enterprise priorities, and the business challenges and trends facing our industry in order to provide context for management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. • Critical accounting policies. This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. • Results of operations. This section contains an analysis of our results of operations by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2010 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2009, and comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2009 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2008. • Liquidity and capital resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2010. 20 Table of Contents Overview Company Background We provide financial services technology solutions, including electronic commerce systems and services such as transaction processing, electronic bill payment and presentment, business process outsourcing, document distribution services, and software and systems solutions. We serve approximately 16,000 clients worldwide including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants, and government agencies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account and transaction fees under contracts with terms ranging from three to five years, and we benefit from high contract renewal rates with our existing clients. The majority of the services we provide to our clients are non-discretionary in nature and are necessary for them to operate their business. Our operations are primarily in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment, the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment, and the Corporate and Other segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services and debit and other card-based payment products and services to meet the electronic transaction processing needs of the financial services industry. The businesses in this segment also provide Internet banking, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, card and print personalization services, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing services, item processing services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate overhead expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations. Industry Trends Market conditions and volatility over the past two years have created a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the United States and internationally. As a result, financial institutions have exercised caution in their information technology spending. Despite this challenging environment, in 2010, our revenue was $4.1 billion, net income per share from continuing operations was $3.34, and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $958 million which increased 1%, 10% and 13%, respectively, as compared to 2009. We believe these financial results demonstrate the resilience of our recurring fee-based revenue model, the largely non-discretionary nature of our products and services, and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry. We believe that financial institutions are increasingly focused on technology solutions that can help them win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue and enhance their operating efficiency. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house transaction processing solutions to outsourced solutions. In each of 2010 and 2009, approximately 1% of all financial institutions in the United States failed or were subject to government action, which has resulted in the loss of a small number of our clients. However, we believe that the number of government actions in 2011 will decline slightly as compared to 2010. The increase in bank failures and forced consolidations during the past two years has been, to some extent, offset by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions. A consolidation benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform, or elects to move to one of our platforms, and negatively impacts us when a competing platform is selected. Consolidations and acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts. These fees are primarily generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. We generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action. In addition, new legislation, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, will result in numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry, although it is too early to determine what impact this complex legislation will have on us or our clients. 21 Table of Contents Enterprise Priorities We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions which enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating through innovation in our products and services. Based on our financial results and our focus on growth and innovation in 2010, we believe we achieved our enterprise priorities for the year. With respect to 2011, our three key enterprise priorities are: (i) to deliver an increased level of high quality revenue growth and increase our earnings per share as compared to 2010; (ii) to further center the Fiserv culture on growth resulting in more clients and deeper client relationships and to secure a higher share of strategic solutions; and (iii) to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients. Business Developments Despite the challenges facing the financial industry, we continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments, including ZashPay, our person-to-person payment service; account processing, including Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions; and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions. We believe our wide range of market-leading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on the opportunities in the marketplace. Critical Accounting Policies General Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Accounting guidance requires us to perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and we compare the aggregate fair values to our market capitalization as an assessment of the 22 Table of Contents appropriateness of our fair value measurements. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2010 determined that our goodwill was not impaired. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Based on our impairment assessments in 2010, we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transaction-based fees. Deferred revenue consists primarily of advance billings for services. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Revenue is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Other We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than letters of credit. We use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates, managing our ratio of fixed to floating-rate debt and foreign exchange rate risks. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Results of Operations Components of Revenue and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Processing and Services Processing and services revenue, which in 2010 represented 83% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue are most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. 23 Table of Contents Product Product revenue, which in 2010 represented 17% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production (12%) and software licenses (5%). Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. Prior to our sale of a 51% interest in substantially all of the businesses in our Insurance segment (“Fiserv Insurance,” which is now owned and operated by StoneRiver Group, L.P., or “StoneRiver”) on July 14, 2008, product revenue and cost of product also included prescription related items which were recognized on a gross basis. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. Financial Results The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

The increase in total revenue during 2010 was primarily due to 2% revenue growth in our Payments segment and included a 0.5% increase in revenue in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2009. The decrease in total revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008, which resulted in a decrease of $513 million, or 11%. As a result of this transaction, the revenue of Fiserv Insurance is no longer included in our consolidated revenue beginning July 15, 2008. In addition, 2009 revenue was impacted by a 1% increase in revenue in our Payments segment and a 3% decline in revenue in our Financial segment. Incremental revenue from acquired companies was $3 million and $27 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Revenue in our Payments segment increased $48 million, or 2%, in 2010 and increased $29 million, or 1%, in 2009 compared to the prior year periods. Revenue growth in our Payments segment during 2010 and 2009 was primarily driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $58 million, or 4%, and $37 million, or 2%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively. This growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our electronic payments businesses, including our electronic banking and electronic funds transfer businesses. Payments segment revenue growth in 2010 was partially offset by lower product revenue, which decreased $10 million, or 2%, as compared to 2009, due to lower revenue in our output solutions business, primarily in the first quarter of 2010. In 2009, Payments segment revenue growth was partially offset by revenue declines in our investment services business from a reduction in the number of accounts processed as a result of the volatility in the U.S. equity markets at that time and a decline in product revenue due primarily to lower software license revenue. Revenue in our Financial segment increased $9 million, or 0.5%, in 2010 and decreased $50 million, or 3%, in 2009 compared to the prior year periods. Revenue growth in our Financial segment during 2010 was favorably impacted by a $31 million, or 2%, increase in processing and services revenue due primarily to increased revenue in our bank and credit union account processing businesses and higher contract termination fee revenue, and was negatively impacted by volume declines in our check processing business which we expect will continue in 2011, decreased revenue in our mortgage lending business, and lower software license revenue. In 2009, Financial segment revenue was negatively impacted by a $35 million decrease in contract termination fee revenue and a decline in check processing revenue. Total Expenses Total expenses decreased $5 million, or 0.2%, in 2010 compared to 2009, notwithstanding an increase in revenue in 2010, primarily due to increased operating leverage and effective management of our overall cost structure. The decrease in total expenses in 2009 of $548 million, or 15%, compared to 2008 was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008, which resulted in a decrease in total expenses of $469 million, or 13%. 25 Table of Contents Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 54.3% in 2010 from 55.4% in 2009 and 56.3% in 2008. The decreases in 2010 and 2009, which had a positive overall impact on our operating margin, were favorably impacted by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, operating efficiency initiatives across the company, and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 74.2% in 2010 compared to 71.7% in 2009 and 81.7% in 2008. Cost of product was relatively unchanged in 2010 compared to 2009; however, cost of product as a percentage of product revenue increased in 2010 due primarily to a decline in higher margin project revenue in our output solutions business and lower software license revenue. In 2008, the higher percentage of product revenue was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, which generated historical overall operating margins of less than 10% primarily due to the inclusion of prescription product costs, which totaled $312 million in 2008, in both product revenue and cost of product. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $11 million, or 1%, and $62 million, or 8%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to lower employee severance expenses. The decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease of $36 million from our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance and lower integration expenses associated with our acquisition of CheckFree Corporation (“CheckFree”). Operating Income and Operating Margin Years Ended December 31, (In millions) Payments Financial Insurance Corporateand Other Total Operating income: 2010 $ 625 $ 591 $ (209 ) $ 1,007 2009 617 569 (240 ) 946 2008 579 545 $ 44 (260 ) 908 Operating income growth (decline): 2010 $ 8 $ 22 $ 31 $ 61 2010 percentage 1 % 4 % 6 % 2009 $ 38 $ 24 $ (44 ) $ 20 $ 38 2009 percentage 7 % 4 % 4 % Operating margin: 2010 28.3 % 30.3 % 24.4 % 2009 28.6 % 29.3 % 23.2 % 2008 27.2 % 27.4 % 8.7 % 19.8 % Operating margin growth (decline):(1) 2010 (0.3 %) 1.0 % 1.2 % 2009 1.4 % 1.9 % 3.4 % (1) Represents the percentage point improvement or decline in operating margin. Total operating income increased $61 million, or 6%, and $38 million, or 4%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Operating margin increased to 24.4% in 2010 from 23.2% in 2009 and 19.8% in 2008. The operating margin improvements of 120 basis points and 340 basis points in 2010 and 2009, respectively, were due in part to our continuing operational effectiveness activities and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. In addition, the increase in operating income and margin in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree and the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, which generated lower operating margins, partially offset by a decrease in higher-margin contract termination fees. 26 Table of Contents Operating income in our Payments segment increased $8 million, or 1%, and $38 million, or 7%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 28.3%, 28.6% and 27.2% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and decreased 30 basis points in 2010 and increased 140 basis points in 2009. Payments segment operating income and margin in 2010 compared to 2009 were impacted by increased expenses associated with the development and support of new and existing products and services which we expect to enhance our long term revenue growth, partially offset by increased operating leverage and scale efficiencies in our transaction processing electronic payments businesses. The increases in operating income and margin in 2009 compared to 2008 were primarily due to cost savings associated with the integration of CheckFree and improved operating leverage in our electronic payments businesses, partially offset by a decline in higher-margin software license revenue. Operating income in our Financial segment increased $22 million, or 4%, and $24 million, or 4%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 30.3%, 29.3% and 27.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and increased 100 basis points in 2010 and 190 basis points in 2009. These improvements in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to revenue growth in 2010 and scale and cost efficiencies in our bank and credit union account processing businesses. In addition, operating income and margin were positively impacted by an increase in higher-margin contract termination fee revenue in 2010 and negatively impacted by a decline in contract termination fee revenue in 2009. The operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment decreased $31 million and $20 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior years. The operating loss decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to a $21 million decrease in employee severance expenses and lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree. The operating loss decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to lower expenses, primarily related to our acquisition of CheckFree. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $22 million, or 10%, and $40 million, or 15%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior years. These decreases were primarily due to the continued reduction in total outstanding borrowings in 2010 and 2009. In addition, interest expense in 2010 was lower than 2009 due to the positive impact of interest rate hedge contracts that expired at the end of 2009. Interest Income Interest income was $10 million, $8 million and $13 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest income in 2008 was higher than 2010 and 2009 due primarily to interest income earned from investing the proceeds of our business dispositions. Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment In September 2010, we issued $750 million of senior notes in a public offering with a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 4.0%. In October 2010, we used a portion of the proceeds from the senior notes offering to purchase $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 for $276 million including the premium paid and other costs associated with the transaction. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $26 million. Loss on Sale of Businesses In 2008, we recognized a $21 million pre-tax loss due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. 27 Table of Contents Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 38.0% in 2010, 37.2% in 2009, and 44.9% in 2008. The higher effective income tax rate in 2008 was due primarily to income taxes associated with our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. In addition, our effective income tax rate in 2009 includes the positive impact of a tax settlement. The significant items impacting our effective income tax rates for continuing operations were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Statutory federal, state and foreign income tax provisions, net 38.0 % 38.1 % 38.3 % Sale of Fiserv Insurance(1) — — 6.6 % Tax settlement(2) — (0.9 %) — Effective income tax rate 38.0 % 37.2 % 44.9 % (1) Represents a $34 million income tax provision related to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. (2) Represents a $7 million income tax benefit recognized in conjunction with the final settlement of a CheckFree purchase accounting income tax reserve. Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate We record our 49% share of StoneRiver’s net income, $14 million, $12 million and $6 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Income (loss) from discontinued operations totaled $(10) million, $3 million and $211 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we recognized after-tax gains from the sale of businesses of $25 million and $229 million, respectively. Net Income Per Share—Diluted from Continuing Operations Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $3.34 in 2010 compared to $3.04 in 2009 and $2.20 in 2008. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2010 compared to 2009 was positively impacted by operating income growth in 2010, partially offset by an $0.11 per share loss on early debt extinguishment. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2009 compared to 2008 was positively impacted by operating income growth in 2009, a $0.34 per share after-tax loss on the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance recognized in 2008, and a $0.14 per share decrease in merger related expenses in 2009 associated with our acquisition of CheckFree. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.60, $0.58 and $0.57 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 28 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using our cash flow generated by operations, our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 of $563 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $971 million at December 31, 2010.

Our operating cash flow in 2010 included a $40 million dividend from StoneRiver, of which we own 49%, that we do not expect to recur on an annual basis. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures of $175 million and $198 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, were less than 5% of our total revenue in each year. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we received $89 million from StoneRiver, of which we own 49%, comprised of a $61 million dividend and a $28 million repayment of a loan. The portion of this dividend that represented a return on our investment, $40 million, is reported in cash flows from operating activities. Share Repurchases We purchased $413 million, $175 million and $441 million of our common stock in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. On November 16, 2010, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 7.0 million additional shares of our common stock and, as of December 31, 2010, we had 6.0 million shares remaining under this authorization. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. Indebtedness December 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 Senior term loan $ 1,100 $ 1,880 Senior notes due 2012 999 1,248 Senior notes due 2015 299 — Senior notes due 2017 500 500 Senior notes due 2020 449 — Other borrowings 9 13 Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 3,356 $ 3,641 In September 2010, we issued $750 million of senior notes due in 2015 and 2020. We used the proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of our senior term loan borrowings and, as described below, to repurchase a 29 Table of Contents portion of our senior notes due in 2012. In 2010, our debt repayments, net of the $750 million senior notes offering, totaled $285 million. In addition, we paid $26 million of premium and other costs associated with the repurchase of the senior notes. At December 31, 2010, our long-term debt consisted primarily of $1.1 billion senior term loan borrowings and $2.25 billion of senior notes. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in 2010. Senior Term Loan In December 2007, we entered into an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. Term loan borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate and mature in November 2012. The weighted-average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 0.9% at December 31, 2010. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below. Senior Notes In September 2010, we issued $300 million of 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 and $450 million of 4.625% senior notes due in October 2020, which pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 commencing on April 1, 2011. Our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 and 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017 pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit: our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens; and our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. Tender Offer to Purchase Senior Notes In October 2010, we purchased $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 for $276 million including the premium paid and other costs associated with the transaction. Revolving Credit Facility In September 2010, we entered into a new $1.0 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks and terminated our then existing $900 million revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in March 2011. Borrowings under the new revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, (i) to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments and (ii) to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense. The facility expires in September 2014. As of December 31, 2010, we issued letters of credit totaling $29 million under the new facility, and had available borrowings of $971 million. Interest Rate Hedge Contracts We maintain interest rate swap agreements (“Swaps”) with total notional values of $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Additionally, in 2010, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements (“Forward-Starting Swaps”) with total notional values of $200 million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted fixed rate borrowings. The Swaps effectively fix the interest rates on floating rate term loan 30 Table of Contents borrowings at a weighted-average rate of approximately 5.0%, prior to financing spreads and related fees, and have expiration dates through September 2012. The Forward-Starting Swaps, which expire in September 2012, effectively fix the benchmark interest rate on forecasted five-year and ten-year borrowings at weighted-average rates of approximately 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively. Shelf Registration Statement In 2010, we filed a “shelf” registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, or a combination thereof. Each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital, acquisitions or general corporate purposes. Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2010, we had a credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB- with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 2.0%. In no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes nor will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed 2.0% above the original interest rate. The interest rates on any series of notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes becomes rated A3 (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody’s and A- (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than letters of credit. The following table details our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2010: (In millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years Long-term debt including interest(1) $ 4,051 $ 185 $ 2,330 $ 425 $ 1,111 Minimum operating lease payments(1) 310 91 121 59 39 Purchase obligations 88 49 31 8 — Income tax obligations 41 15 22 2 2 Total $ 4,490 $ 340 $ 2,504 $ 494 $ 1,152 (1) Interest and operating lease payments are reported on a pre-tax basis. 31 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency risk. We actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management. In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable merchants. These subscriber funds are invested in short-term instruments that are guaranteed by the United States government. Subscriber funds, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment activity, and totaled approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2010. Based on interest rates and subscriber funds balances at December 31, 2010, a 1% increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual income from continuing operations by approximately $10 million, and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero, our annual income from continuing operations would decrease by less than $5 million. We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating-rate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts. We currently use interest rate swaps with total notional values of $1 billion and forward-starting swaps with total notional values of $200 million at December 31, 2010, to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs. Generally, under these swaps, we agree with a counter-party to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount. Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at December 31, 2010, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. We conduct business in the U.S. and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2010, there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position. 32 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:20:22.236423

This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2011. 19 Table of Contents Overview Company Background We are a leading global provider of financial services technology. We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, Internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve approximately 16,000 clients worldwide including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants and government agencies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years, and we have experienced high contract renewal rates with our clients. The majority of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their business and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. Our operations are primarily in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment, the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment and the Corporate and Other segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services, debit and other card-based payment products and services, Internet and mobile banking software and services, and other electronic payments software and services including account-to-account transfers and person-to-person payments. Our businesses in this segment also provide investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, card and print personalization services, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations. In September 2011, we acquired CashEdge Inc. (“CashEdge”), a leading provider of consumer and business payments solutions such as account-to-account transfer, account opening and funding, data aggregation, small business invoicing and payments, and person-to-person payments, for approximately $460 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition of CashEdge is expected to advance our digital payments strategies. In the first quarter of 2011, we acquired Mobile Commerce Ltd. (“M-Com”), an international mobile banking and payments provider, and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50 million. M-Com enhances our mobile and payments capabilities, and the other acquired companies add to or enhance specific products or services that we already provide. Enterprise Priorities We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2012 are: (i) to deliver improved financial performance including an increased level of high quality revenue growth; (ii) to further center the Fiserv culture on growth resulting in more clients and deeper client relationships and to secure a higher share of strategic solutions; and (iii) to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients. Industry Trends Market and regulatory conditions have continued to create a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the United States and internationally. As a result, financial institutions have 20 Table of Contents exercised caution in their information technology spending. Despite this environment, in 2011, our revenue increased 5%, to $4.3 billion, as compared to 2010; net income per share from continuing operations increased 2% to $3.40, which included a charge of $0.37 per share for the loss on early debt extinguishment, as compared to 2010; and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $953 million. We believe this revenue growth demonstrates the resilience of our recurring fee-based revenue model, the largely non-discretionary nature of our products and services, and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry. In recent years, many of our financial institution clients have finalized their spending decisions later in the year. As a result, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, a larger percentage of our annual revenue occurring in the second half of the year. We believe that financial institutions are increasingly focused on technology solutions that we provide to help them win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue and enhance their operating efficiency. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house transaction processing solutions to outsourced solutions. In each of 2010 and 2009, approximately 1% of all financial institutions in the United States failed or were subject to government action. The number of government actions and the average size of institutions impacted by such actions decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010. These reductions resulted in the loss of a small number of our clients. In 2012, we believe that the number of government actions will continue to decline as compared to 2011. Bank failures and forced consolidations have been, to some extent, offset by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions. A consolidation benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform, or elects to move to one of our platforms, and negatively impacts us when a competing platform is selected. Consolidations and acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts. These fees are primarily generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. We generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action. In addition, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and will continue to generate, numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry. It is too early, however, to fully determine the overall impact of this complex legislation on us or our clients over the long term. Business Developments We continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments, including person-to-person payments; Mobiliti for mobile banking and payments services; account processing, including Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions; and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions. We believe our wide range of market-leading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace. Critical Accounting Policies General Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. 21 Table of Contents Acquisitions We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In 2011, we early adopted guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to the assessment of qualitative factors in evaluating goodwill for impairment. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess numerous qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units. If it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we perform a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step in this test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets, goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2011 determined that our goodwill was not impaired. Based on the most recent fair value estimates, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Based on our impairment assessments in 2011, we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. Deferred revenue consists primarily of advance billings for services. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Revenue is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 22 Table of Contents Other We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than letters of credit. We use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates, managing our ratio of fixed to floating-rate debt and foreign exchange rate risks. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Results of Operations Components of Revenue and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Processing and Services Processing and services revenue, which in 2011 represented 82% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenue, which in 2011 represented 18% of our consolidated revenue, is derived from integrated print and card production (13%) and software licenses (5%). Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees, and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 23 Table of Contents Financial Results The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

Total Revenue Total revenue increased $204 million, or 5%, in 2011 and increased $56 million, or 1%, in 2010 compared to the prior years. The increase in total revenue during 2011 was primarily due to 8% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 3% revenue growth in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2010. The increase in total revenue during 2010 was primarily due to 2% revenue growth in our Payments segment as compared to 2009. Revenue from acquired companies contributed $30 million and $3 million to revenue in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Revenue in our Payments segment increased $173 million, or 8%, in 2011 and increased $48 million, or 2%, in 2010 compared to the prior years. Revenue from acquired companies totaled $26 million and positively impacted revenue growth by approximately one percentage point in 2011. Revenue growth in our Payments segment during 2011 and 2010 was primarily driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $99 million, or 6%, and $58 million, or 4%, in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our electronic payments businesses, including our electronic banking and card services businesses. In addition, higher postage pass-through revenue, which is included in both product revenue and cost of product, in our output solutions business contributed approximately three percentage points of growth in this segment in 2011. In 2010, Payments segment revenue growth of 2% was negatively impacted by lower product revenue in our output solutions business, which decreased $10 million, or 2%, as compared to 2009. 25 Table of Contents Revenue in our Financial segment increased $53 million, or 3%, in 2011 and increased $9 million, or 0.5%, in 2010 compared to the prior years. Revenue growth in our Financial segment was favorably impacted by increases of $42 million and $31 million, or 2% in each of 2011 and 2010, in processing and services revenue due primarily to increased revenue in our bank and credit union account processing businesses and, in 2010, by higher contract termination fee revenue. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by volume declines in our check processing business in 2011 and 2010. In 2011, Financial segment revenue growth was favorably impacted by an $11 million increase in product revenue, primarily due to higher software license revenue, and in 2010, product revenue was negatively impacted by a decline in software license revenue compared to the prior year periods. Total Expenses Total expenses increased $215 million, or 7%, in 2011 compared to 2010 and decreased $5 million, or 0.2%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 77.0%, 75.6% and 76.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue increased to 54.8% in 2011 and decreased to 54.3% in 2010 from 55.4% in 2009. In 2011 and 2010, cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, operating efficiency initiatives across the company, and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. In 2011, cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with the development and support of new and existing products and services and increased employee compensation costs. These new products and services include Mobiliti for mobile banking and payments services and Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 75.7% in 2011 compared to 74.2% in 2010 and 71.7% in 2009. The increase in cost of product in 2011 was primarily due to an increase in postage pass-through revenue and expenses in our output solutions business. Cost of product was relatively unchanged in 2010 compared to 2009. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue, however, increased in 2010 due primarily to a decline in higher-margin software license revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $59 million, or 8%, and decreased $11 million, or 1%, in 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to the prior years. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily in our Corporate and Other segment due to $18 million of employee severance expenses, increased employee compensation and commission costs totaling $15 million, and higher merger and integration costs of $12 million. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to lower employee severance expenses and a $5 million gain on the sale of a facility which reduced expenses in 2010. Operating Income and Operating Margin Total operating income decreased $11 million, or 1%, in 2011 and increased $61 million, or 6%, in 2010 compared to the prior years. Operating income in 2011 was negatively impacted by higher expenses in our Corporate and Other segment and favorably impacted by operating income growth of 5% and 4% in our Payments and Financial segments, respectively. Operating margin decreased to 23.0% in 2011 from 24.4% in 2010 and increased in 2010 from 23.2% in 2009. The operating margin decline of 140 basis points in 2011 was primarily due to increased operating losses in our Corporate and Other segment. The operating margin improvement of 120 basis points in 2010 was due in part to operational effectiveness activities and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. Operating income in our Payments segment increased $31 million, or 5%, and $8 million, or 1%, in 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 27.5%, 28.3% and 28.6% in 2011, 2010 26 Table of Contents and 2009, respectively, and decreased 80 basis points in 2011 and 30 basis points in 2010. Payments segment operating income in 2011 and 2010 was favorably impacted by improved revenue growth and increased operating leverage and scale efficiencies in our electronic payments businesses. Operating margins in 2011 and 2010 were negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with the development and support of new and existing products and services. In addition, operating margin in the Payments segment in 2011 was negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points due to increased postage pass-through costs, which are included in both revenue and expenses. Operating income in our Financial segment increased $22 million, or 4%, in each of 2011 and 2010 compared to the prior years. Operating margins improved in both years and were 30.6%, 30.3% and 29.3% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These improvements in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to improved revenue growth and cost efficiencies in our bank and credit union account and item processing businesses. In addition, in 2011, operating income and operating margin were positively impacted by higher software license revenue and negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with our new Acumen account processing platform. In 2010, operating income and margins were positively impacted by an increase in higher-margin contract termination fee revenue and negatively impacted by a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue. The operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment increased $64 million in 2011 and decreased $31 million in 2010 compared to the prior years. The operating loss increase in 2011 was primarily due to employee severance costs of $18 million, higher merger and integration costs of $17 million, a $9 million increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and a $5 million gain on the sale of a facility recorded in 2010. The operating loss decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to a $21 million decrease in employee severance expenses and lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree Corporation (“CheckFree”). Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $10 million, or 5%, and $22 million, or 10%, in 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to the prior years. These decreases were primarily due to lower average interest rates in 2011 and 2010 as compared to the prior years and, in 2010, a reduction in average outstanding borrowings as compared to 2009. Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment In June 2011, we purchased $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 in a tender offer for $754 million, and in July 2011, we redeemed the remaining $300 million aggregate principal amount of these notes for $322 million. In October 2010, we purchased $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 for $276 million. We recorded pre-tax losses on early debt extinguishment for the premiums paid and other costs associated with these transactions of $85 million in 2011 and $26 million in 2010. Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 35.1% in 2011, 38.0% in 2010 and 37.2% in 2009. The lower effective tax rate in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the resolution of tax audits and changes in state tax laws. The higher effective tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized in 2009 in connection with the final settlement of a CheckFree purchase accounting income tax reserve. Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate Our 49% share of the income of StoneRiver Group, L.P. (“StoneRiver”) was $18 million, $14 million and $12 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2011, the $4 million increase in income was primarily due to a $3 million gain on the sale of a business by StoneRiver. 27 Table of Contents Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Income (loss) from discontinued operations totaled $(19) million, $(10) million and $3 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2009, we recognized a $25 million after-tax gain from the sale of a business. Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing Operations Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $3.40 in 2011 compared to $3.34 in 2010 and $3.04 in 2009. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted by losses on early debt extinguishment of $0.37 per share and $0.11 per share in 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted in 2011 by $0.08 per share due to employee severance expenses. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.69, $0.60 and $0.58 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using our cash flow generated by operations, our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 of $337 million, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

In 2011, our operating cash flow was negatively impacted by a $28 million decrease in the portion of StoneRiver dividends that are included in operating cash flow and a $12 million increase in working capital compared to 2010. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures of $192 million and $175 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, were less than 5% of our total revenue in each year. The $17 million increase in capital expenditures in 2011 was primarily due to equipment purchases associated with a new data center. In 2011, we acquired CashEdge, M-Com, and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $511 million, net of cash acquired. In 2011 and 2010, we received cash dividends of $54 million and $61 million, respectively, from StoneRiver. The portions of these dividends that represented returns on our investment, $12 million in 2011 and $40 million in 2010, are reported in cash flows from operating activities. 28 Table of Contents Share Repurchases We purchased $533 million, $413 million and $175 million of our common stock in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. On May 25, 2011, we announced that our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 7.5 million shares of our common stock and, as of December 31, 2011, we had 4.7 million shares remaining under this authorization. On February 22, 2012, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 10.0 million additional shares of our common stock. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans.

At December 31, 2011, our long-term debt consisted primarily of $1.1 billion senior term loan borrowings and $2.25 billion of senior notes. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in 2011. Senior Term Loan We maintain an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. Term loan borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate and mature in November 2012. The weighted-average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 1.0% at December 31, 2011. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below. At December 31, 2011, a portion of our term loan borrowings, $925 million, was classified in our consolidated balance sheet as long-term debt because we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and could do so under our revolving credit facility that expires in 2014. Senior Notes In June 2011, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $600 million of 3.125% senior notes due in June 2016 and $400 million of 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021, which pay interest semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 and $450 million of 4.625% senior notes due in October 2020, which pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Our 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017 pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit: our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens; and our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. 29 Table of Contents In June 2011, we purchased $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 in a tender offer for $754 million, and in July 2011, we redeemed the remaining $300 million aggregate principal amount of these notes for $322 million. Revolving Credit Facility We maintain a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate (2.3% at December 31, 2011). There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The facility expires in September 2014. As of December 31, 2011, there were letters of credit totaling $28 million and no borrowings outstanding under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense. Interest Rate Hedge Contracts We maintain interest rate swap agreements (“Swaps”) with total notional values of $1.0 billion to hedge against changes in interest rates and forward-starting interest rate swap agreements (“Forward-Starting Swaps”) with total notional values of $550 million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted fixed rate borrowings. The Swaps and Forward-Starting Swaps expire in September 2012 and have been designated by us as cash flow hedges. The Swaps effectively fix the interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weighted-average rate of approximately 5.0%, prior to financing spreads and related fees. The Forward-Starting Swaps effectively fix the benchmark interest rate on forecasted five-year and ten-year borrowings at weighted-average rates of approximately 3.2% and 3.9%, respectively. Shelf Registration Statement In 2010, we filed a “shelf” registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, or a combination thereof. Each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital, acquisitions or general corporate purposes. Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, we had a credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB- with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 2.0%. In no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes nor will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed 2.0% above the original interest rate. 30 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than letters of credit.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency. We actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management. In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. These subscriber funds are invested in short-term instruments that are guaranteed by the United States government. Subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity. Based on average subscriber funds balances during 2011 of approximately $1.0 billion, a 1% increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pre-tax income by approximately $10 million, and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero, our annual pre-tax income would decrease by less than $5 million. We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts. We currently use interest rate swaps with total notional values of $1 billion and forward-starting swaps with total notional values of $550 million at December 31, 2011 to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs. Generally, under these swaps, we agree with a counter-party to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount. Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at December 31, 2011, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2012 by less than $5 million. We conduct business in the United States and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. In 2011, 7% of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2011, there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position. 31 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:20:24.829225
798354,FI,FISERV INC,2013,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows: • Overview. This section contains background information on our company and the services and products that we provide, our enterprise priorities and the trends and business developments affecting our industry in order to provide context for management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. • Critical accounting policies. This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. • Results of operations. This section contains an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2012 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2011 and by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2011 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2010. • Liquidity and capital resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2012. 20 Overview Company Background We are a leading global provider of financial services technology. We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve approximately 16,000 clients worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants and government agencies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. We also have had high contract renewal rates with our clients. The majority of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their business and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. Our operations are primarily in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment and the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services, debit and other card-based payment products and services, internet and mobile banking software and services, and other electronic payments software and services including account-to-account transfers and person-to-person payments. Our businesses in this segment also provide investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, card and print personalization services, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations. On January 14, 2013, we acquired Open Solutions Inc. (“Open Solutions”), a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions for a cash purchase price of $55 million. We also assumed approximately $960 million of Open Solutions’ debt in connection with the acquisition. This acquisition advances Fiserv’s go-to-market strategies by adding a number of products and services and by expanding the number of account processing clients to which we can provide a broad array of our add-on solutions. In September 2011, we acquired CashEdge Inc. (“CashEdge”), a leading provider of consumer and business payments solutions such as account-to-account transfer, account opening and funding, data aggregation, small business invoicing and payments, and person-to-person payments, for approximately $460 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition of CashEdge has advanced our digital payments strategy. In the first quarter of 2011, we acquired Mobile Commerce Ltd. (“M-Com”), an international mobile banking and payments provider, and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50 million, net of cash acquired. M-Com has enhanced our mobile and payments capabilities, and the other acquired companies have added to or enhanced specific products or services that we already provide. Enterprise Priorities We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2013 are: (i) to continue to build high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; (ii) to extend market momentum into deeper client relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions; and (iii) to deliver innovation and integration to enhance results for our clients. 21 Industry Trends Market and regulatory conditions have continued to create a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the United States and internationally. In addition, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and will continue to generate, numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry. Financial institutions have generally remained cautious in their information technology spending as a result. These conditions have, however, created interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include our digital channels and electronic payments solutions, including mobile banking and person-to-person payments. Despite the difficult environment over the past several years, our revenue increased 3% to $4.5 billion in 2012 as compared to 2011, our net income per share from continuing operations increased to $4.34 as compared to $3.40 in 2011, which included a loss from early debt extinguishment in 2011 of $0.37 per share, and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $835 million. We believe these financial results demonstrate the resilience of our recurring, fee-based revenue model, the largely non-discretionary nature of our products and services, and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology solutions to outsourced solutions. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year. This decline is primarily a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions, although in the past several years was also due to government actions. In 2012, the number of government actions continued to decline as compared to 2011 and 2010. Although these reductions in the number of financial institutions resulted in the loss of a small number of our clients, bank failures and forced consolidations have been, to some extent, offset by a general decline in the number of mergers and acquisitions among financial institutions. A consolidation benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform, or elects to move to one of our platforms, and negatively impacts us when a competing platform is selected. Consolidations and acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts. Contract termination fees are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi-year contract is acquired by another financial institution. These fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. We generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action. Business Developments We continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments, including Popmoney for person-to-person payments; Mobiliti for mobile banking and payments services; and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions. We believe our wide range of market-leading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace. Critical Accounting Policies General Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. 22 Acquisitions We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. We have not aggregated any operating segments into reporting units for purposes of conducting goodwill impairment testing. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess numerous qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units. If it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or to the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, then we perform a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step in this test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets, goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2012 determined that our goodwill was not impaired. Based on the most recent fair value estimates, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Based on our impairment assessments in 2012, we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. Deferred revenue consists primarily of advance billings for services. Revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Additionally, given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 23 Results of Operations Components of Revenue and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Processing and Services Processing and services revenue, which in 2012 represented 83% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenue, which in 2012 represented 17% of our consolidated revenue, is derived from integrated print and card production (13%) and software licenses (4%). Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees, and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 24 Financial Results The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

Total Revenue Total revenue increased $145 million, or 3%, in 2012 and increased $204 million, or 5%, in 2011 compared to the prior years. The increase in total revenue during 2012 was primarily due to 5% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 2% revenue growth in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2011. The increase in total revenue during 2011 was primarily due to 8% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 3% revenue growth in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2010. Revenue from acquired companies contributed $43 million and $30 million to revenue in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Revenue in our Payments segment increased $108 million, or 5%, in 2012 and increased $173 million, or 8%, in 2011 compared to the prior years. Revenue growth in our Payments segment during 2012 and 2011 was primarily driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $98 million and $99 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, or 6% each year. The growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services business as well as our digital channels business, which includes our mobile banking solution. Revenue from acquired companies totaled $40 million and $26 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, and positively impacted revenue growth by approximately two percentage points and one percentage point in the respective periods. In addition, higher postage pass-through revenue, which is included in both product revenue and cost of product in our output solutions business, contributed to growth in this segment by approximately one percentage point in 2012 and three percentage points in 2011. The positive growth in 2012 was partially offset by lower revenue in our electronic bill payment business, driven primarily by the loss of a client that was acquired by another financial institution. 26 Revenue in our Financial segment increased $36 million, or 2%, in 2012 and increased $53 million, or 3%, in 2011 compared to the prior years. Revenue growth in our Financial segment was favorably impacted by increases of $67 million, or 4%, and $42 million, or 2%, in 2012 and 2011, respectively, in processing and services revenue due primarily to increased revenue in our account processing and lending businesses, partially offset by volume declines in our check processing business. In addition, Financial segment growth was negatively impacted by approximately two percentage points in 2012 primarily due to lower software license revenue. Total Expenses Total expenses increased $85 million, or 3%, in 2012 compared to 2011 and increased $215 million, or 7%, in 2011 compared to 2010. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 76.4%, 77.0% and 75.6% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 53.1% in 2012 and increased to 54.8% in 2011 from 54.3% in 2010. In 2012 and 2011, cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and operating efficiency initiatives across the company that lowered our overall cost structure. In 2011, this positive impact was offset by increased expenses associated with the development and support of new and existing products and services. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 81.2% in 2012 compared to 75.7% in 2011 and 74.2% in 2010. The increase in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in high-margin software license sales as compared to 2011. The cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in both 2012 and 2011 was also impacted by an increase in postage pass-through revenue and expenses in our output solutions business. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $30 million, or 4%, and $59 million, or 8%, in 2012 and 2011, respectively, compared to the prior years; however, selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was relatively consistent in 2012 at 18.5% compared to 18.4% in 2011. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2011 was primarily in the Corporate and Other segment and was due to employee severance and merger and integration expenses. Operating Income and Operating Margin Total operating income increased $60 million, or 6%, in 2012 and decreased $11 million, or 1%, in 2011 compared to the prior years. Operating margin increased to 23.6% in 2012 from 23.0% in 2011 and decreased in 2011 from 24.4% in 2010. The operating margin improvement of 60 basis points in 2012 was due in part to increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and operational effectiveness activities that lowered our overall cost structure. The operating margin decline of 140 basis points in 2011 was primarily due to increased operating losses in the Corporate and Other segment primarily attributable to higher employee severance, merger and integration costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Operating income in our Payments segment increased $12 million, or 2%, and $31 million, or 5%, in 2012 and 2011, respectively, compared to the prior years, primarily due to growth and operating leverage in our card services business. Operating margins were 26.8%, 27.5% and 28.3% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and decreased 70 basis points in 2012 and 80 basis points in 2011. Payments segment operating margins in 2012 and 2011 were negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with the development, support and integration of new products and services, including Popmoney for person-to-person payments and Mobiliti for mobile banking and payment services. Operating margin was also negatively impacted in 2012 by a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue and by lower revenue in our electronic bill payment business driven primarily by the loss of a client that was acquired by another financial institution. In addition, operating margins in the Payments segment in 2012 and 2011 were negatively impacted by increased postage pass-through costs, which are included in both revenue and expenses. 27 Operating income in our Financial segment increased $39 million, or 6%, and $22 million, or 4%, in 2012 and 2011, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins improved in both years and were 32.0%, 30.6% and 30.3% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These improvements in operating income and operating margin in 2012 were primarily due to improved revenue growth and scale efficiencies in our account processing and lending businesses and operating efficiencies in our item processing businesses, partially offset by a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue. Operating margin in 2011 was consistent with 2010. The operating loss in the Corporate and Other segment decreased $9 million in 2012 and increased $64 million in 2011 compared to the prior years. The changes in operating loss were primarily due to employee severance and merger and integration costs which, in total, decreased $10 million in 2012 and increased $35 million in 2011 as compared to the respective prior year periods. In addition, the remaining increase in 2011 was also attributable to higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $14 million, or 7%, and $10 million, or 5%, in 2012 and 2011, respectively, compared to the prior years. These decreases were primarily due to lower average interest rates in 2012 and 2011 as compared to the prior years as a result of our debt refinancing activities. In 2012, interest expense was negatively impacted by $4 million of expense associated with hedge ineffectiveness recognized upon the settlement of our forward-starting interest rate swap agreements (“Forward-Starting Swaps”) in September of 2012. Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment In 2011 and 2010, we issued $1.0 billion and $750 million principal amount of senior notes, respectively, in public debt offerings and used proceeds from the offerings to repay our senior notes which matured in November 2012. The premium paid on the early retirement of debt and other costs associated with the transactions resulted in pre-tax charges of $85 million in 2011 and $26 million in 2010. Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 34.0% in 2012, 35.1% in 2011 and 38.0% in 2010. The lower effective tax rate in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to increased deductions resulting from federal tax planning initiatives, including the associated discrete tax benefits. The lower effective tax rate in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the resolution of tax audits and changes in state tax laws. Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate Our 49% share of the income of StoneRiver Group, L.P. (“StoneRiver”) was $11 million, $18 million and $14 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, the increase in income was primarily due to a $3 million gain, representing our share, on the sale of a business by StoneRiver. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Income (loss) from discontinued operations related to prior dispositions totaled $14 million, $(19) million and $(10) million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and included income tax (expense) benefits of $(10) million, $13 million and $14 million, respectively. Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing Operations Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $4.34 in 2012 compared to $3.40 in 2011 and $3.34 in 2010. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted by a loss on early debt extinguishment of $0.37 per share in 2011. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.76, $0.69 and $0.60 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 28 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, our cash and cash equivalents of $358 million at December 31, 2012 and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

In 2012, our working capital was negatively impacted by an increase in payments for discretionary and incentive-based employee compensation, including company 401k profit sharing contributions, and higher income tax payments in 2012 compared to 2011, partially offset by improved accounts receivable collections in 2012. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures of $195 million in 2012 remained relatively consistent with 2011 expenditures and were less than 5% of our total revenue in each year. In 2012 and 2011, we received cash dividends of $55 million and $54 million, respectively, from StoneRiver. The portions of these dividends that represented returns on our investment, $23 million in 2012 and $12 million in 2011, are reported in cash flows from operating activities. In 2011, we acquired CashEdge, M-Com and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $511 million, net of cash acquired. Share Repurchases We purchased $634 million, $533 million and $413 million of our common stock in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. On February 22, 2012, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to ten million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 5.6 million shares remaining under this authorization. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. 29 Indebtedness December 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 Revolving credit facility $ 280 $ - 3.125% senior notes due 2015 300 299 3.125% senior notes due 2016 600 599 6.8% senior notes due 2017 500 500 4.625% senior notes due 2020 449 449 4.75% senior notes due 2021 399 399 3.5% senior notes due 2022 697 - Senior term loan - 1,100 Other borrowings 5 49 Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 3,230 $ 3,395 In September 2012, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2022 and used the net proceeds from this offering primarily to repay a portion of our senior term loan that was due in November 2012. The remaining outstanding amount of the term loan was repaid upon maturity using available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available cash. At December 31, 2012, our long-term debt consisted primarily of $2.95 billion of senior notes and $280 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in 2012. The acquisition of Open Solutions on January 14, 2013 for a cash purchase price of $55 million and repayment of assumed debt of $960 million was funded in 2013 utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility. Revolving Credit Facility In August 2012, we entered into a $2.0 billion Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks, replacing our existing $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in September 2014. Borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate (1.3% at December 31, 2012). There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The facility expires on August 1, 2017 and contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended. Senior Notes In September 2012, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% senior notes due in October 2022, which pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on April 1, 2013. In June 2011, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $600 million of 3.125% senior notes due in June 2016 and $400 million of 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021, which pay interest semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. Our 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 and our 4.625% senior notes due in October 2020 pay interest at the stated rate on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Our 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017 pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The interest rates 30 applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. In June 2011, we purchased $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 in a tender offer for $754 million, and in July 2011, we redeemed the remaining $300 million aggregate principal amount of these notes for $322 million. Senior Term Loan Our senior term loan matured in November 2012 and was repaid using a combination of proceeds from the September 2012 issuance of senior notes, our revolving credit facility and available cash. Term loan borrowings under this facility bore interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate. Interest Rate Hedge Contracts To manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we maintained Forward-Starting Swaps, designated as cash flow hedges, with a total notional value of $550 million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted five-year and ten-year fixed rate borrowings. Upon the issuance of senior notes in September 2012, we paid $88 million, included in cash flows from operating activities, to settle the Forward-Starting Swaps and recognized approximately $4 million of interest expense due to hedge ineffectiveness. The remaining $84 million is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes of $33 million, and will be recognized as interest expense over the terms of the originally forecasted interest payments. In addition, we maintained interest rate swap agreements (“Swaps”), designated as cash flow hedges, with a total notional value of $1.0 billion to hedge against changes in interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings. The Swaps, which expired in September 2012, effectively fixed the interest rate on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weighted-average rate of approximately 5.0% prior to financing spreads and related fees. There were no Swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2012. Shelf Registration Statement In 2010, we filed a “shelf” registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, or a combination thereof. Each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital, acquisitions or general corporate purposes. Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, we had a credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB- with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. 31 The interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes nor will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed two percent above the original interest rate. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than letters of credit. The following table details our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2012: (In millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years Long-term debt including interest (1) $ 4,064 $ 132 $ 560 $ 1,588 $ 1,784 Minimum operating lease payments (1) 274 73 109 60 32 Purchase obligations (1) 280 129 127 11 13 Income tax obligations 56 8 31 10 7 Total $ 4,674 $ 342 $ 827 $ 1,669 $ 1,836 (1) Interest, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency. We actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management. In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. These subscriber funds are primarily invested in short-term instruments that are guaranteed by the United States government. Subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity. Based on average subscriber funds balances during 2012 of approximately $1.0 billion, a 1% increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pre-tax income by approximately $10 million, and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero, our annual pre-tax income would decrease by less than $5 million. We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt and previously through the use of interest rate hedge contracts. We previously maintained interest rate swap agreements with total notional values of $1 billion and forward-starting swaps with a total notional value of $550 million to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs. All interest rate hedge contracts were settled or expired in September 2012. Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at December 31, 2012, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2013 by less than $5 million. We conduct business in the United States and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. In 2012, 7% of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2012, there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position. 32",2023-12-30 20:20:21.519967

We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve approximately 14,500 clients worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants and government agencies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. We also have had high contract renewal rates with our clients. The majority of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their business and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. Our operations are primarily in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment and the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services, debit and other card-based payment products and services, internet and mobile banking software and services, and other electronic payments software and services, including account-to-account transfers and person-to-person payments. Our businesses in this segment also provide investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, card and print personalization services, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance. On November 20, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of our common stock and a proportionate increase in the number of our authorized shares of common stock. The additional shares were distributed on December 16, 2013 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 2, 2013. Our common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 17, 2013. All share and per share amounts are retroactively presented on a split-adjusted basis. In the fourth quarter of 2013, StoneRiver Group, L.P., a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, completed a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business, resulting in a gain. Our share of the gain on the transaction was $71 million, with related income tax expense of $17 million. In the first quarter of 2013, we acquired Open Solutions Inc. (“Open Solutions”), a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions, for a cash purchase price of $55 million and the assumption of approximately $960 million of debt. With this acquisition, we added DNA, a real-time, open architecture account processing system, along with 3,300 existing Open Solutions clients. This acquisition advanced Fiserv’s go-to-market strategies by adding a number of products and services and by expanding the number of account processing clients to which we can provide our broad array of add-on solutions. In the third quarter of 2011, we acquired CashEdge Inc. (“CashEdge”), a leading provider of consumer and business payments solutions such as account-to-account transfer, account opening and funding, data aggregation, small business invoicing and payments, and person-to-person payments, for approximately $460 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition of CashEdge has advanced our digital payments strategies. In the first quarter of 2011, we acquired Mobile Commerce Ltd. (“M-Com”), an international mobile banking and payments provider, and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50 million, net of cash acquired. M-Com has enhanced our mobile and payments capabilities, and the other acquired companies have added to or enhanced specific products or services that we already provide. 21 Table of Contents Enterprise Priorities We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2014 are: (i) to continue to build high-quality revenue growth while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) to extend market momentum deeper into client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions; and (iii) to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients. Industry Trends Market and regulatory conditions have continued to create a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the United States and internationally. In particular, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and will continue to generate, numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry. Financial institutions have generally remained cautious in their information technology spending as a result. These conditions have, however, created interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include our digital channels and electronic payments solutions, including mobile banking and person-to-person payments. Despite the difficult environment over the past several years, our revenue increased 9% to $4.8 billion in 2013 as compared to 2012, our net income per share from continuing operations increased to $2.44 in 2013 as compared to $2.15 in 2012 and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $1.0 billion in 2013 compared to $826 million in 2012. We believe these financial results demonstrate the resilience of our recurring, fee-based revenue model, the largely non-discretionary nature of our products and services, and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology solutions to outsourced solutions. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. An acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system, or elects to move to one of our systems, and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected. Financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts. Contract termination fees are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi-year contract is acquired by another financial institution. These fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. Business Developments We continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments, including Popmoney for person-to-person payments; Mobiliti for mobile banking and payments services; and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions. In January 2013, we acquired Open Solutions and its DNA account processing system. We believe our wide range of industry-leading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial 22 Table of Contents statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. Acquisitions We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step in the quantitative test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets, goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the quantitative test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2013 determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Based on our impairment assessments in 2013, we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired. 23 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Additionally, given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations Components of Revenue and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. Processing and Services Processing and services revenue, which in 2013 represented 84% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenue, which in 2013 represented 16% of our consolidated revenue, is derived from integrated print and card production (13%) and software licenses (3%). Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 24 Table of Contents Financial Results On March 14, 2013, the Company sold its club solutions business (“Club Solutions”). The results of operations and cash flows of Club Solutions, which were previously included within the Payments segment, have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Total Revenue Total revenue increased $378 million, or 9%, in 2013 and increased $147 million, or 3%, in 2012 compared to the prior years. The increase in total revenue during 2013 was attributable to 13% revenue growth in our Financial segment due primarily to the acquisition of Open Solutions and 4% revenue growth in our Payments segment, in each case, as compared to 2012. The increase in total revenue during 2012 was primarily due to 5% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 2% revenue growth in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2011. Revenue from acquired companies contributed $270 million and $43 million to revenue in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Revenue in our Payments segment increased $109 million, or 4%, in 2013 and increased $110 million, or 5%, in 2012 compared to the prior years. Payments segment revenue growth during 2013 and 2012 was primarily driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $114 million and $100 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, or 6% each year. The growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services business and digital channels business, which includes our online and mobile banking solutions, as well as our biller solutions and bill payment businesses in 2013. In 2012, revenue from acquired companies totaling $40 million and higher postage pass-through revenue, which is included in both product revenue and cost of product in our output solutions business, positively impacted revenue growth by approximately three percentage points as compared to 2011. The positive 26 Table of Contents revenue growth in both 2013 and 2012 was partially offset by lower software license revenue, along with a discount on the renewal of a bill payment contract in 2013 and the loss of a client that was acquired by another financial institution in 2012. Revenue in our Financial segment increased $269 million, or 13%, in 2013 and increased $36 million, or 2%, in 2012 compared to the prior years. Financial segment revenue growth in 2013 was driven by the acquisition of Open Solutions, which contributed $270 million in revenue. Excluding the Open Solutions acquisition, revenue growth in 2013 was flat compared to the prior year, primarily due to the migration of an account processing client from our system to its parent company’s account processing system. In 2012, revenue growth in our Financial segment was favorably impacted by an increase of $67 million, or 4%, in processing and services revenue primarily attributed to increased revenue in our account processing and lending businesses, partially offset by volume declines in our check processing business. In addition, Financial segment growth was negatively impacted by approximately two percentage points in 2012 primarily due to lower software license revenue as compared to 2011. Total Expenses Total expenses increased $365 million, or 11%, in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased $89 million, or 3%, in 2012 compared to 2011. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 78.0%, 76.4% and 76.9% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in total expenses and as a percentage of total revenue in 2013 is due primarily to the acquisition of Open Solutions. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 51.6% in 2013 compared to 52.9% in 2012 and 54.4% in 2011. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2013 and 2012 by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that lowered our cost structure. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 89.2% in 2013 compared to 81.2% in 2012 and 75.7% in 2011. The increase in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2013 was primarily attributable to merger and integration costs resulting from the Open Solutions acquisition, including a $30 million non-cash impairment charge related to the replacement of our Acumen® account processing system with DNA, an Open Solutions account processing system. The increase in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in high-margin software license sales, as well as an increase in postage pass-through revenue and expenses in our output solutions business, as compared to 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $153 million, or 19%, and $29 million, or 4%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior years. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 20.3%, 18.6% and 18.5% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2013 was primarily due to higher acquired intangible amortization and merger and integration costs of $53 million attributable to our acquisition of Open Solutions. Operating Income and Operating Margin Total operating income increased $13 million, or 1%, in 2013 and $58 million, or 6%, in 2012 compared to the prior years. Operating margin decreased to 22.0% in 2013 from 23.6% in 2012 and increased in 2012 from 23.1% in 2011. The operating margin decline of 160 basis points in 2013 was due to increased operating losses of $125 million in our Corporate and Other segment, which negatively impacted our operating margin by 260 basis points due primarily to acquired intangible amortization and merger and integration costs of $115 million associated with the acquisition of Open Solutions. This negative impact was partially offset by positive margin increases in our Payments and Financial segments in 2013. The operating margin improvement of 50 basis points in 2012 was due in part to increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and operational effectiveness activities that lowered our cost structure. 27 Table of Contents Operating income in our Payments segment increased $45 million, or 7%, and $9 million, or 1%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 27.5%, 26.9% and 27.8% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and increased 60 basis points in 2013 and decreased 90 basis points in 2012. The increases in operating income were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in our card services business in 2013 and 2012, as well as our digital channels business in 2013. Payments segment operating margins were negatively impacted by a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue in both years, along with a discount on the renewal of a bill payment contract in 2013 and the loss of a client that was acquired by another financial institution in 2012. Operating margin in 2012 was also negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with the development, support and integration of new products and services, including Popmoney for person-to-person payments and Mobiliti for mobile banking and payment services. Operating income in our Financial segment increased $93 million, or 14%, and $39 million, or 6%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margin in 2013 improved slightly to 32.2% as compared to 2012, which improved to 32.0% from 30.6% in 2011. These improvements in operating income and margin in 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to scale efficiencies and operational effectiveness benefits, partially offset by the migration of an account processing client to its parent company’s account processing system in 2013 and a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue in 2012 as compared to 2011. The operating loss in the Corporate and Other segment increased $125 million in 2013 and decreased $10 million in 2012 compared to the prior years. The increase in operating loss in 2013 was primarily attributable to merger and integration costs of $65 million resulting from the Open Solutions acquisition, including a $30 million non-cash impairment charge related to the replacement of our Acumen account processing system with DNA, an Open Solutions account processing system. In addition, amortization expenses increased by $50 million in 2013, primarily related to Open Solutions acquired intangible assets. The decrease in operating loss in 2012 was primarily due to reduced employee severance and merger and integration costs as compared to 2011. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $10 million, or 6%, and $14 million, or 7%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior years. These decreases were primarily due to lower average interest rates in 2013 and 2012 as compared to the prior years as a result of our debt refinancing activities. The interest expense decrease in 2013 was partially offset by additional debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of Open Solutions. In 2012, interest expense was negatively impacted by $4 million of expense associated with hedge ineffectiveness recognized upon the settlement of our forward-starting interest rate swap agreements (“Forward-Starting Swaps”) in September of 2012. Interest and Investment Income Interest and investment income decreased $6 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to a gain recognized on a sale of an investment in the prior year period. Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment In 2011, we issued $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes in a public debt offering and used the proceeds to repay our senior notes which matured in November 2012. The premium paid on the early retirement of debt and other costs associated with the transaction resulted in pre-tax charges of $85 million in 2011. Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 36.5% in 2013, 34.0% in 2012 and 35.1% in 2011. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to the income tax expense associated with our share of a gain on a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business by our unconsolidated affiliate, StoneRiver Group, L.P. (“StoneRiver”). The lower effective tax rate in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to increased deductions resulting from federal tax planning initiatives, including the associated discrete tax benefits. 28 Table of Contents Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate Our share of the income of StoneRiver, a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest, was $80 million, $11 million and $18 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2013 increase in income was due to our $71 million share of a gain on a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business by StoneRiver. (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations (Loss) income from discontinued operations related to Club Solutions and prior dispositions totaled $(2) million, $19 million and $(15) million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and included income tax (expense) benefits of $(4) million, $(13) million and $11 million, respectively. Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing Operations Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $2.44 in 2013 compared to $2.15 in 2012 and $1.69 in 2011. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2013 was favorably impacted by $0.20 per share from our share of a gain on a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business by StoneRiver, offset by merger and integration costs of $0.20 per share incurred due to the acquisition of Open Solutions. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted by a loss on early debt extinguishment of $0.18 per share in 2011. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.51, $0.37 and $0.34 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, our cash and cash equivalents of $400 million at December 31, 2013 and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The following table presents our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Year EndedDecember 31, Increase (Decrease) (In millions) 2013 2012 $ % Income from continuing operations $ 650 $ 592 $ 58 Depreciation and amortization 403 350 53 Share-based compensation 46 44 2 Deferred income taxes (9 ) 5 (14 ) Income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate (80 ) (11 ) (69 ) Non-cash impairment charge 30 - 30 Dividends from unconsolidated affiliate 6 23 (17 ) Settlement of interest rate hedge contracts - (88 ) 88 Net changes in working capital and other (7 ) (89 ) 82 Operating cash flow $ 1,039 $ 826 $ 213 26 % Capital expenditures $ 236 $ 193 $ 43 22 % Our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow, was $1,039 million in 2013, an increase of 26% compared with $826 million in 2012. This increase was primarily due to increased earnings, favorable working capital changes and a payment of $88 million for the settlement of Forward-Starting Swaps in 2012. In 2013, our working capital was positively impacted by timing of various cash payments and receipts and overall 29 Table of Contents lower income tax payments compared to 2012. In addition, working capital was negatively impacted in 2012 by an increase in payments for discretionary and incentive-based employee compensation, including company 401(k) profit sharing contributions. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures in 2013 increased by $43 million compared to 2012 and were less than 5% of our total revenue in each year. In the first quarter of 2013, we acquired Open Solutions for a cash purchase price of $16 million, net of cash acquired, and sold Club Solutions for $35 million in cash. In 2013 and 2012, we received cash dividends of $122 million and $55 million, respectively, from StoneRiver. The portions of these dividends that represented returns on our investment, $6 million in 2013 and $23 million in 2012, are reported in cash flows from operating activities. Share Repurchases We purchased $578 million and $634 million of our common stock in 2013 and 2012, respectively. On each of February 22, 2012 and August 5, 2013, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 18.5 million shares remaining under this authorization. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. Indebtedness December 31, (In millions) 2013 2012 Term loan $ 900 $ - 3.125% senior notes due 2015 300 300 3.125% senior notes due 2016 600 600 6.8% senior notes due 2017 500 500 4.625% senior notes due 2020 449 449 4.75% senior notes due 2021 399 399 3.5% senior notes due 2022 697 697 Revolving credit facility - 280 Other borrowings 3 5 Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 3,848 $ 3,230 The acquisition of Open Solutions in January 2013 for a cash purchase price of $55 million and repayment of assumed debt of $960 million was funded utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility. In October 2013, we obtained a $900 million term loan under a new loan agreement with a syndicate of banks and used the net proceeds from the term loan to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2013, our long-term debt consisted primarily of $2.95 billion of senior notes and $900 million of term loan borrowings. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in 2013. Term Loan On October 25, 2013, we obtained a $900 million term loan under a new loan agreement with a syndicate of banks. This term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or the bank’s base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time, and matures in October 2018. The weighted average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 1.4% at December 31, 2013. Scheduled principal payments of $90 million are due on the last business day of December of each year, commencing on 30 Table of Contents December 31, 2014, with the remaining principal balance of $540 million due in October 2018. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below. Revolving Credit Facility In connection with the term loan financing described above, on October 25, 2013, we entered into an amendment to our existing $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that conformed certain of its provisions to those in the new term loan agreement and extended its maturity to October 25, 2018. The revolving credit facility was previously scheduled to expire on August 1, 2017. Borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or the bank’s base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. As of December 31, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended. Senior Notes In September 2012, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% senior notes due in October 2022, which pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. In June 2011, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $600 million of 3.125% senior notes due in June 2016 and $400 million of 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021, which pay interest semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. Our 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 and our 4.625% senior notes due in October 2020 pay interest at the stated rate on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Our 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017 pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. Interest Rate Hedge Contracts To manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we maintained Forward-Starting Swaps, designated as cash flow hedges, with a total notional value of $550 million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted five-year and ten-year fixed rate borrowings. Upon the issuance of senior notes in September 2012, we paid $88 million, included in cash flows from operating activities, to settle the Forward-Starting Swaps and recognized approximately $4 million of interest expense due to hedge ineffectiveness. The remaining $84 million was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes of $33 million, and is being recognized as interest expense over the terms of the originally forecasted interest payments. In addition, we maintained interest rate swap agreements (“Swaps”) that expired in September of 2012, designated as cash flow hedges, with a total notional value of $1.0 billion to hedge against changes in interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings. There were no Forward-Starting Swaps or Swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2013. Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013, we had a credit 31 Table of Contents rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB- with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rates payable on our senior notes, term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than letters of credit. The following table details our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2013: (In millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years Long-term debt including interest (1) (2) $ 4,588 $ 231 $ 1,334 $ 1,304 $ 1,719 Minimum operating lease payments (1) 333 83 132 70 48 Purchase obligations (1) 251 112 107 24 8 Income tax obligations 60 16 24 15 5 Total $ 5,232 $ 442 $ 1,597 $ 1,413 $ 1,780 (1) Interest, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis. (2) The calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, no refinancing occurs and the variable rate on the term loan is priced at the rate in effect as of December 31, 2013. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency. Our senior management actively monitors these risks. In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. These subscriber funds are invested in short-term, highly liquid investments. Subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity. Based on daily average subscriber funds balances during 2013 of approximately $1.0 billion, a 1% increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pre-tax income by approximately $10 million, and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero, our annual pre-tax income would decrease by less than $5 million. We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt. We have also used interest rate hedge contracts. We previously maintained interest rate swap agreements with total notional values of $1.0 billion and forward-starting swaps with a total notional value of $550 million to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs. All interest rate hedge contracts were settled or expired in September 2012. Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at December 31, 2013, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2014 by approximately $9 million. 32 Table of Contents We conduct business in the United States and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately $53 million to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. In 2013, approximately 7% of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2013, there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position. 33 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:20:25.219206

We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve approximately 14,500 clients worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, and merchants. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. Our operations are principally located in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment and the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment. The Payments segment primarily provides debit, credit and prepaid card processing and services, electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, person-to-person payment services, and other electronic payments software and services. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts, credit unions, and leasing and finance companies with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance. During 2014, StoneRiver Group, L.P. (“StoneRiver”), a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses, and in 2013, completed a transaction which reduced its ownership interest in another subsidiary business, resulting in a gain associated with the deconsolidation. Our share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was $87 million in 2014 and $71 million in 2013, with related tax expenses of $36 million and $17 million, respectively. In addition, we received cash dividends, funded from capital transactions, from StoneRiver of $110 million and $122 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. On November 20, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of our common stock and a proportionate increase in the number of our authorized shares of common stock. The additional shares were distributed on December 16, 2013 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 2, 2013. Our common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 17, 2013. All share and per share amounts are retroactively presented on a split-adjusted basis. On January 14, 2013, we acquired Open Solutions Inc. (“Open Solutions”), a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions, for a cash purchase price of $55 million and the assumption of approximately $960 million of debt. With this acquisition, we added DNA, a real-time, open architecture account processing system, along with 3,300 existing Open Solutions’ clients. This acquisition advanced our go-to-market strategies by adding a number of products and services and by expanding the number of account processing clients to which we can provide our broad array of add-on solutions. Enterprise Priorities We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and 20 Table of Contents differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2015 are: (i) to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and (iii) to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients. Industry Trends The market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly. The financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment, deposit, lending, investment and risk management products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, regulatory conditions have continued to create a difficult operating environment for financial institutions. In particular, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and will continue to generate, numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry. These conditions, along with mild economic improvement, have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as “digital channels.” This increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. We expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes amidst an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. Based on these market conditions, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth. In addition, we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients. In addition to the trends described above, the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. An acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system, or elects to move to one of our systems, and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected. Financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts, which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi-year contract is acquired by another financial institution. These fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. Our revenue is diversified, and our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model, and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25% of our annual revenue. In addition, we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. 21 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. Acquisitions We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry, and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step in the quantitative test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets, goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the quantitative test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2014 determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values. 22 Table of Contents We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. No impairment of our acquired intangible assets was identified during 2014. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. At times, however, judgment is exercised in evaluating revenue recognition, such as when a contract arrangement includes multiple product and service deliverables. Due to the quantity, size and nature of our multiple element arrangements, the judgments we make in this regard are not likely to have a material impact on revenue recognition for any individual element. Additionally, given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations Components of Revenue and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. Processing and Services Processing and services revenue, which in 2014 represented 83% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenue, which in 2014 represented 17% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales which represented less than 4% of our consolidated revenue. Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 23 Table of Contents Financial Results On March 14, 2013, the Company sold its club solutions business (“Club Solutions”). The 2013 and 2012 results of operations and cash flows of Club Solutions, which were previously included within the Payments segment, have been reported as discontinued operations. The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

Total Revenue Total revenue increased $252 million, or 5%, in 2014 and increased $378 million, or 9%, in 2013 compared to the prior years. The increase in total revenue during 2014 was due to 8% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 3% revenue growth in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2013. The increase in total revenue during 2013 was attributable to 13% revenue growth in our Financial segment due primarily to the acquisition of Open Solutions and 4% revenue growth in our Payments segment, in each case, as compared to 2012. The Open Solutions acquisition contributed $270 million to revenue in 2013. Revenue in our Payments segment increased $195 million, or 8%, in 2014 and increased $109 million, or 4%, in 2013 compared to the prior years. Payments segment revenue growth during 2014 and 2013 was driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $128 million, or 7%, and $114 million, or 6%, in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services, bill payment and digital channels businesses, as well as our biller solutions business in 2013. Higher product revenue from increased volumes in our output solutions business, a portion of which is postage pass-through revenue that is included in both product revenue and cost of product, also contributed to overall segment revenue growth in 2014. The positive revenue growth in 2013 was partially offset by lower software license revenue as compared to the prior year, along with a discount on the renewal of a bill payment contract. 25 Table of Contents Revenue in our Financial segment increased $58 million, or 3%, in 2014 and increased $269 million, or 13%, in 2013 compared to the prior years. In 2014, revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased processing and services revenue in our account processing and lending businesses, including higher contract termination fee revenue. This growth was partially offset by a revenue decline in our international business due to the completion of several client implementations in the prior year and negative currency fluctuations in the current year. Financial segment revenue growth in 2013 was driven by the acquisition of Open Solutions, which contributed $270 million in revenue. Excluding the Open Solutions acquisition, revenue growth in 2013 was flat compared to the prior year, primarily due to the migration of an account processing client from our system to its parent company’s account processing system. Total Expenses Total expenses increased $103 million, or 3%, in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased $365 million, or 11%, in 2013 compared to 2012. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 76.1%, 78.0% and 76.4% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in total expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2013 was due primarily to higher merger and integration expenses attributable to our acquisition of Open Solutions. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 51.3% in 2014 compared to 51.6% in 2013 and 52.9% in 2012. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2014 and 2013 by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, as well as by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that have lowered our cost structure. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 84.7% in 2014 compared to 89.2% in 2013 and 81.2% in 2012. In 2013, cost of product included merger and integration costs resulting from the Open Solutions acquisition, including a $30 million non-cash impairment charge related to the replacement of our Acumen® account processing system with DNA, an Open Solutions’ account processing system, which resulted in an increase in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue. In 2014, cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was negatively impacted by an increase in postage pass-through revenue and expense in our output solutions business. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 19.2%, 20.3% and 18.6% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in both 2014 and 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher acquired intangible amortization, and in 2013, merger and integration costs attributable to our acquisition of Open Solutions. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was favorably impacted by reduced professional services expenses, including merger and integration costs, in 2014 as compared to 2013. Operating Income and Operating Margin Total operating income increased $149 million, or 14%, in 2014 and $13 million, or 1%, in 2013 compared to the prior years. Operating margin increased to 23.9% in 2014 from 22.0% in 2013 and decreased in 2013 from 23.6% in 2012. Operating income and margin were positively impacted in 2014 primarily by scale efficiencies, operational effectiveness initiatives, and lower merger and integration expenses in our Corporate and Other segment related to the Open Solutions acquisition. The operating margin decline of 160 basis points in 2013 was due to increased operating losses of $125 million in our Corporate and Other segment, which negatively impacted our operating margin by 260 basis points due primarily to acquired intangible amortization and merger and integration costs of $115 million associated with the acquisition of Open Solutions. This negative impact was partially offset by positive margin increases in our Payments and Financial segments in 2013. Operating income in our Payments segment increased $66 million, or 9%, and $45 million, or 7%, in 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 28.0%, 27.5% and 26.9% in 2014, 2013 26 Table of Contents and 2012, respectively, and increased 50 basis points in 2014 and 60 basis points in 2013. The increases in operating income were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in our card services and digital channels businesses in 2014 and 2013, as well as our bill payment business in 2014. During 2014, Payments segment operating margin improvements were partially offset by increased postage pass-through costs in our output solutions business, which are included in both revenue and expenses, as well as increased expenses associated with investments in our biller solutions business. Operating margin in 2013 was negatively impacted by a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue, along with a discount on the renewal of a bill payment contract. Operating income in our Financial segment increased $28 million, or 4%, and $93 million, or 14%, in 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margin in 2014 improved 40 basis points to 32.6% as compared to 2013, which improved slightly to 32.2% from 32.0% in 2012. These improvements in operating income and margin in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to scale efficiencies and operational effectiveness initiatives, along with higher contract termination fee revenue in our account processing businesses in 2014. In addition, the increase in operating income in 2013 was also attributed to the acquisition of Open Solutions. The operating loss in the Corporate and Other segment decreased $55 million in 2014 and increased $125 million in 2013 compared to the prior years. The 2014 decrease in operating loss was primarily due to reduced merger and integration costs related to the Open Solutions acquisition as compared to 2013. The increase in operating loss in 2013 was primarily attributable to merger and integration costs of $65 million resulting from the Open Solutions acquisition, along with increased amortization expenses of $50 million, primarily related to Open Solutions’ acquired intangible assets. Interest Expense Interest expense was consistent in 2014 and 2013, and decreased $10 million, or 6%, in 2013 compared to 2012. A decline in average outstanding debt during 2014 was offset by slightly higher variable interest rates as compared to 2013. The decrease in interest expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 was due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by additional debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of Open Solutions. Interest and Investment Income Interest and investment income was consistent in 2014 and 2013, and decreased $6 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to a gain recognized on a sale of an investment in 2012. Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 36.6% in 2014, 36.5% in 2013 and 34.0% in 2012. The 2014 effective income tax rate was relatively consistent with 2013 as increased deductions resulting from federal tax planning initiatives and the favorable resolution of tax matters were offset by additional income tax expense associated with our share of net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses at StoneRiver, a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to income tax expense associated with our share of a gain on a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business by StoneRiver. Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate Our share of the income of StoneRiver was $91 million, $80 million and $11 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. During 2014, StoneRiver recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses, and in 2013, completed a transaction which reduced its ownership interest in another subsidiary business, resulting in a gain associated with the deconsolidation. Our share of the gains and related expenses on these transactions was $87 million in 2014 and $71 million in 2013. 27 Table of Contents (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations (Loss) income from discontinued operations related to Club Solutions and prior dispositions totaled $(2) million and $19 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, and included income tax expense of $4 million and $13 million, respectively. Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing Operations Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $2.99 in 2014 compared to $2.44 in 2013 and $2.15 in 2012. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted in both 2014 and 2013 by $0.20 per share from our share of net transaction gains at StoneRiver, and was negatively impacted in 2013 by merger and integration costs of $0.20 per share incurred due to the acquisition of Open Solutions. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.52, $0.51 and $0.37 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, our cash and cash equivalents of $294 million at December 31, 2014 and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The following table presents our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Year EndedDecember 31, Increase (Decrease) (In millions) 2014 2013 $ % Net income from continuing operations $ 754 $ 650 $ 104 Depreciation and amortization 404 403 1 Share-based compensation 49 46 3 Deferred income taxes 3 (9 ) 12 Income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate (91 ) (80 ) (11 ) Dividends from unconsolidated affiliate 110 6 104 Non-cash impairment charge - 30 (30 ) Net changes in working capital and other 78 (7 ) 85 Operating cash flow $ 1,307 $ 1,039 $ 268 26 % Capital expenditures $ 292 $ 236 $ 56 24 % Our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow, was $1.3 billion in 2014, an increase of 26% compared with $1.0 billion in 2013. This increase was primarily due to increased earnings, favorable working capital changes and cash dividends received from our StoneRiver joint venture, representing returns on our investment. Working capital was favorably impacted in 2014 by the timing of accrued expenses, including client deposits and income taxes, and was negatively impacted in 2013 by payments related to merger and integration costs and assumed liabilities resulting from the acquisition of Open Solutions. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 6% and 5% of our total revenue in 2014 and 2013, respectively. 28 Table of Contents In 2014 and 2013, we received cash dividends of $110 million and $122 million, respectively, from StoneRiver. The portions of these dividends that represented returns on our investment, $110 million in 2014 and $6 million in 2013, are reported in cash flows from operating activities. In the first quarter of 2013, we acquired Open Solutions for a cash purchase price of $16 million, net of cash acquired, along with the assumption of approximately $960 million of debt, and sold Club Solutions for approximately $35 million in cash. Share Repurchases Cash outflows for repurchases of our common stock were $1.1 billion and $578 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. On each of August 5, 2013 and November 19, 2014, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. Purchases pursuant to the August 5, 2013 authorization have been completed. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 19.8 million shares remaining under the November 19, 2014 authorization. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans.

In October 2013, we obtained a $900 million term loan under a new loan agreement with a syndicate of banks and used the net proceeds from the term loan to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2014, our long-term debt consisted primarily of $2.95 billion of senior notes and $810 million of term loan borrowings. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2014. Term Loan On October 25, 2013, we obtained a $900 million term loan under a new loan agreement with a syndicate of banks. This term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or the bank’s base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time, and matures in October 2018. The variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 1.4% at December 31, 2014. Scheduled principal payments of $90 million commenced on December 31, 2014 and are due on the last business day of December of each year, with the remaining principal balance of $540 million due in October 2018. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below. Revolving Credit Facility In connection with the term loan financing described above, on October 25, 2013, we entered into an amendment to our existing $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that conformed certain of its 29 Table of Contents provisions to those in the new term loan agreement and extended its maturity to October 25, 2018. Borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or the bank’s base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The weighted average variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings was 1.15% at December 31, 2014. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended. Senior Notes In September 2012, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% senior notes due in October 2022. These senior notes, along with our 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 and our 4.625% senior notes due in October 2020, pay interest at the stated rates on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Our 3.125% senior notes due in June 2016 and 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021 pay interest at the stated rates on June 15 and December 15 of each year, and our 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017 pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. At December 31, 2014, our 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility, which matures in October 2018. Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rates payable on our senior notes, term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes. 30 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than letters of credit. The following table details our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2014: (In millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years Long-term debt including interest (1) (2) $ 4,436 $ 231 $ 1,523 $ 1,027 $ 1,655 Minimum operating lease payments (1) 383 93 137 67 86 Purchase obligations (1) 207 118 66 19 4 Income tax obligations 55 3 34 13 5 Total $ 5,081 $ 445 $ 1,760 $ 1,126 $ 1,750 (1) Interest, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis. (2) The calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, the 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 are refinanced on a long-term basis, no additional refinancing or lending occurs, and the variable rates on the term loan and revolving credit facility are priced at the rate in effect as of December 31, 2014. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency. Our senior management actively monitors these risks. We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt. Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at December 31, 2014, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2015 by approximately $8.5 million. In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. These subscriber funds are invested in short-term, highly liquid investments. Subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity. Based on daily average subscriber funds balances during 2014 of approximately $1.0 billion, a 1% increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pre-tax income by approximately $10 million, and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero, our annual pre-tax income would decrease by less than $5 million. We conduct business in the United States and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately $73 million as of December 31, 2014 to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. In 2014, approximately 6% of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2014, there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position. 31 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:20:23.112492

This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2015.16Table of ContentsOverview Company BackgroundWe are a leading global provider of financial services technology. We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve approximately 13,000 clients worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants, mutual savings banks, and building societies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature.Our operations are principally located in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment and the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment. The Payments segment primarily provides debit and credit card processing and services, electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, person-to-person payment services, and other electronic payments software and services. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts, credit unions, and leasing and finance companies with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Corporate and Other primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses including share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance.During 2015 and 2014, StoneRiver Group, L.P. (“StoneRiver”), a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses, and in 2013, completed a transaction which reduced its ownership interest in another subsidiary business, resulting in a gain associated with the deconsolidation. Our share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was $29 million in 2015, $87 million in 2014 and $71 million in 2013, with related tax expenses of $13 million, $36 million and $17 million, respectively. In addition, we received cash dividends, funded from capital transactions, from StoneRiver of $36 million, $110 million, and $122 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.On January 14, 2013, we acquired Open Solutions Inc. (“Open Solutions”), a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions, for a cash purchase price of $55 million and the assumption of approximately $960 million of debt. With this acquisition, we added DNA, a real-time, open architecture account processing system, along with 3,300 existing Open Solutions’ clients. This acquisition advanced our go-to-market strategies by adding a number of products and services and by expanding the number of account processing clients to which we can provide our broad array of add-on solutions.Enterprise PrioritiesWe continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2016 are: (i) to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and (iii) to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.Industry TrendsThe market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly. The financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment, deposit, lending, investment and risk management products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, regulatory conditions have continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. In particular, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and will continue to generate, numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry. These conditions, along with mild economic improvement, have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as “digital channels.”17Table of ContentsThis increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. We expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes amidst an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. Based on these market conditions, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth. Furthermore, we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients.In addition to the trends described above, the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. An acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system, or elects to move to one of our systems, and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected. Financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts, which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi-year contract is acquired by another financial institution. These fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. Our revenue is diversified, and our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model, and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25% of our annual revenue. In addition, we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates.AcquisitionsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible AssetsWe review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit’s last quantitative test, the extent a 18Table of Contentsreorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry, and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test.The first step in the quantitative test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets, goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the quantitative test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions.Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015 determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values.We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. No impairment of our acquired intangible assets was identified during 2015.Revenue RecognitionThe majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. At times, however, judgment is exercised in evaluating revenue recognition, such as when a contract arrangement includes multiple product and service deliverables. Due to the quantity, size and nature of our multiple element arrangements, the judgments we make in this regard are not likely to have a material impact on revenue recognition for any individual element. Additionally, given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Results of OperationsComponents of Revenue and ExpensesThe following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income.Processing and ServicesProcessing and services revenue, which in 2015 represented 84% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses.ProductProduct revenue, which in 2015 represented 16% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales which represented less than 4% of our consolidated revenue. Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue.19Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses.Financial ResultsIn March 2013, we sold our club solutions business (“Club Solutions”). The 2013 results of operations and cash flows of Club Solutions, which were previously included within the Payments segment, have been reported as discontinued operations.The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year.

Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted overall revenue growth by approximately 50 basis points in 2015. The increase in total revenue during 2015 was due to 4% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 3% revenue growth in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2014. The increase in total revenue during 2014 was attributable to 8% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 3% revenue growth in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2013. Revenue in our Payments segment increased $115 million, or 4%, in 2015 and increased $195 million, or 8%, in 2014 compared to the prior years. Payments segment revenue growth during 2015 and 2014 was driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $129 million, or 6%, and $128 million, or 7%, in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services, bill payment and digital channels businesses, as well as our biller solutions business in 2015. Product revenue decreased $14 million, or 2%, in 2015 and increased $67 million, or 10%, in 2014 compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower software license revenue as compared to the prior year, while the higher product revenue in 2014 was attributable to increased volumes including a higher level of card reissuances in our output solutions business, a portion of which is postage pass-through revenue that is included in both product revenue and cost of product.Revenue in our Financial segment increased $76 million in 2015 and $58 million in 2014, or 3% in each year, compared to the prior years. In both 2015 and 2014, revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased processing and services revenue in our account processing and lending businesses, including higher contract termination fee revenue. This growth was partially offset by negative foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 70 basis points and 30 basis points in 2015 and 2014, 21Table of Contentsrespectively, along with a revenue decline in our international business in 2014 due to the completion of several client implementations in 2013. Total ExpensesTotal expenses increased $87 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $103 million, or 3%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 75.1%, 76.1% and 78.0% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was higher in 2013 due primarily to merger and integration expenses attributed to our acquisition of Open Solutions.Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 49.4% in 2015 compared to 51.3% in 2014 and 51.6% in 2013. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2015 and 2014 by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, as well as by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that have benefited our overall cost structure.Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 86.7% in 2015 compared to 84.7% in 2014 and 89.2% in 2013. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was negatively impacted in 2015 by increased expenses in our output solutions business associated with additional investments to expand our card manufacturing and personalization capacity. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue improved in 2014 due to higher merger and integration costs in 2013 resulting from the Open Solutions acquisition, including a $30 million non-cash impairment charge related to the replacement of our Acumen® account processing system with DNA, an Open Solutions account processing system.Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 19.7%, 19.2% and 20.3% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2015 as compared to 2014 was largely due to increased share-based compensation and incremental costs associated with data center and real estate consolidation activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was favorably impacted by reduced professional services expenses, including merger and integration costs, in 2014 as compared to 2013.Operating Income and Operating MarginTotal operating income increased $101 million, or 8%, in 2015 and $149 million, or 14%, in 2014 compared to the prior years. Total operating margin increased to 24.9% in 2015 from 23.9% in 2014 and 22.0% in 2013. Operating income and operating margin improvements in 2015 and 2014 were driven by scale efficiencies, expense discipline and operational effectiveness initiatives, along with lower merger and integration expenses in Corporate and Other related to the Open Solutions acquisition.Operating income in our Payments segment increased $72 million, or 9%, and increased $66 million, or 9%, in 2015 and 2014, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 29.3%, 28.0% and 27.5% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, improving 130 basis points in 2015 and 50 basis points in 2014. The increases in operating income and operating margin in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in a number of our businesses, including card services. During 2015, Payments segment operating margin improvements were partially offset by increased expenses associated with additional investments in our biller and output solutions businesses, along with a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue. Operating margin in 2014 was negatively impacted by increased postage pass-through costs in our output solutions business, which are included in both revenue and expenses.Operating income in our Financial segment increased $53 million, or 7%, and increased $28 million, or 4%, in 2015 and 2014, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margin in 2015 improved 120 basis points to 33.8% as compared to 2014, which improved 40 basis points to 32.6% from 32.2% in 2013. Operating income and operating margin were positively impacted in both years by revenue growth, including higher contract termination fee revenue, along with operational effectiveness initiatives and scale efficiencies primarily in our account processing businesses.The operating loss in Corporate and Other increased $24 million in 2015 and decreased $55 million in 2014 compared to the prior years, primarily due to merger, integration and other cost activity. The operating loss increase in 2015 was attributable to increased costs incurred in conjunction with the achievement of our operational effectiveness objectives, including incremental costs related to data center and real estate consolidation activities. The 2014 decrease in operating loss compared to 2013 was primarily due to reduced merger and integration costs related to the Open Solutions acquisition. Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased $6 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and was consistent in 2014 and 2013. The increase in interest expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the reclassification of unamortized losses on settled cash flow hedges to interest expense related to the early extinguishment of debt. A decline in average outstanding debt during 2014 was offset by slightly higher variable interest rates as compared to 2013.22Table of ContentsLoss on Early Debt ExtinguishmentIn May 2015, we redeemed our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in 2016 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.8% senior notes due in 2017, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $85 million related to make-whole payments and other costs associated with redemption.Income Tax ProvisionOur effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 35.7% in 2015, 36.6% in 2014 and 36.5% in 2013. The lower effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower income tax expense associated with our share of the net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses by our unconsolidated affiliate, StoneRiver. The 2014 effective income tax rate was relatively consistent with 2013 as increased deductions resulting from federal tax planning initiatives and the favorable resolution of tax matters were offset by additional income tax expense associated with our share of net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses at StoneRiver.Income from Investment in Unconsolidated AffiliateOur share of the income of StoneRiver was $32 million, $91 million and $80 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During 2015 and 2014, StoneRiver recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses, and in 2013, completed a transaction which reduced its ownership interest in another subsidiary business, resulting in a gain associated with the deconsolidation. Our share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was $29 million in 2015, $87 million in 2014 and $71 million in 2013.Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing OperationsNet income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $2.99 in both 2015 and 2014 and $2.44 in 2013. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted from our share of net transaction gains at StoneRiver of $0.07 per share in 2015 and $0.20 per share in both 2014 and 2013, and was negatively impacted in 2015 by debt extinguishment and refinancing costs of $0.25 per share and in 2013 by merger and integration costs of $0.20 per share incurred due to the acquisition of Open Solutions. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.53, $0.52 and $0.51 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralOur primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, our cash and cash equivalents of $275 million at December 31, 2015 and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The following table presents our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

This increase was primarily due to increased operating results, partially offset by a decrease in cash dividends received from our StoneRiver joint venture, representing returns on our investment.Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 7% and 6% of our total revenue in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2015 include $70 million related to our Atlanta facility consolidation, consisting primarily of leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment, of which $25 million is offset by landlord reimbursements included in net changes in working capital and other.In 2015 and 2014, we received cash dividends of $36 million and $110 million, respectively, from our StoneRiver joint venture. These dividends, in their entirety, represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities. In January 2016, we received a $140 million cash dividend from StoneRiver funded from the January 2016 sale of a business interest.On January 20, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with ACI Worldwide, Inc. to acquire certain assets of its Community Financial Services business in a transaction valued at $200 million, exclusive of related tax benefits. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions and is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2016.Share RepurchasesWe purchased $1.47 billion and $1.16 billion of our common stock in 2015 and 2014, respectively. On November 19, 2014 and November 18, 2015, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 20.0 million and 15.0 million shares, respectively, of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 17.4 million shares remaining under these authorizations. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans.Indebtedness December 31,(In millions)2015 2014Term loan$628 $808Revolving credit facility379 423.125% senior notes due 2015— 3003.125% senior notes due 2016— 5996.8% senior notes due 2017— 4982.7 % senior notes due 2020843 —4.625% senior notes due 2020448 4474.75% senior notes due 2021397 3973.5% senior notes due 2022694 6933.85 % senior notes due 2025893 —Other borrowings11 6Long-term debt (including current maturities)$4,293 $3,790At December 31, 2015, our long-term debt consisted primarily of $3.3 billion of senior notes, $628 million of term loan borrowings and $379 million of revolving credit facility borrowings. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2015. The December 31, 2014 debt balances above have been adjusted on a retrospective basis for the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. Accordingly, debt issuance costs of $21 million and $13 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to our term loan and senior notes are reported as a direct reduction of the related debt instrument.24Table of ContentsRevolving Credit FacilityIn April 2015, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement that restated our existing $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and extended its maturity from October 2018 to April 2020. The amended and restated credit agreement also provided that our subsidiaries that were guaranteeing our obligations under the revolving credit facility were released from their respective guarantees. Borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility continue to bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings was 1.49% at December 31, 2015. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The amended revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that are substantially similar to those under our previously existing credit agreement and require us, among other things, to: (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended.Term LoanWe maintain a term loan with a syndicate of banks that matures in October 2018 and bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or on a base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. The variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 1.67% at December 31, 2015. A remaining scheduled principal payment of $90 million is due on December 31, 2017, with the outstanding principal balance of $540 million due at maturity. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above. In April 2015, we entered into an amendment to our term loan facility to conform certain of its terms to those in the amended and restated credit agreement, including providing that our subsidiaries that were guaranteeing our obligations under the term loan facility were released from their respective guarantees.Senior NotesIn May 2015, we completed an offering of $1.75 billion of senior notes comprised of $850 million aggregate principal amount of 2.7% senior notes due in June 2020 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 3.85% senior notes due in June 2025. The notes pay interest at the stated rates semi-annually on June 1 and December 1, which commenced on December 1, 2015. Our 4.625% senior notes due in October 2020 and 3.5% senior notes due in October 2022 pay interest at the stated rates on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Our 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021 pay interest at the stated rate on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. At December 31, 2014, our $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term as we had the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so under our amended and restated revolving credit facility. In October 2015, we used our available borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility to repay the $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes.In May 2015, we used the net proceeds from the offering described above to redeem our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in June 2016 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017. We recorded a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $85 million related to make-whole payments and other costs associated with this redemption. In addition, we paid scheduled December 2015 and December 2016 principal payments on the term loan totaling $180 million and repaid, at that time, outstanding borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility. The remaining net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes.In April 2015, we provided notice to the trustee under the indenture and supplemental indentures governing our outstanding senior notes that the subsidiary guarantors of the outstanding senior notes were automatically released from all of their obligations under the supplemental indentures and their respective guarantees.OtherAccess to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s 25Table of ContentsInvestors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities.The interest rates payable on our senior notes, term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than letters of credit. The following table details our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2015:(In millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsLong-term debt including interest (1) (2) $5,143 $143 $906 $1,904 $2,190Minimum operating lease payments (1) 344 89 128 60 67Purchase obligations (1) 371 163 168 40 —Income tax obligations 54 16 20 12 6Total $5,912 $411 $1,222 $2,016 $2,263(1)Interest, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis.(2)The calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, no additional refinancing or lending occurs, and the variable rates on the term loan and revolving credit facility are priced at the rate in effect as of December 31, 2015.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency. Our senior management actively monitors these risks.We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt. Based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at December 31, 2015, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2016 by approximately $10 million.In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. These subscriber funds are invested in short-term, highly liquid investments. Subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity. Based on daily average subscriber funds balances during 2015 of approximately $1.1 billion, a 1% increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pre-tax income by approximately $10 million, and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero, our annual pre-tax income would decrease by less than $5 million.We conduct business in the United States and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with total notional values of approximately $85 million as of December 31, 2015 to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. In 2015, approximately 6% of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2015, there would not have been a material impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position.26Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:20:15.425253
