On September 30, 2004, Enterprise and GulfTerra completed the merger of GulfTerra with a wholly owned subsidiary of Enterprise, with GulfTerra being the surviving entity thereof. Additionally, Enterprise completed certain other transactions related to the merger, including receipt of Enterprise GP’s contribution of a 50% membership interest in GulfTerra GP, which was acquired by Enterprise GP from El Paso, and the purchase of certain midstream energy assets located in South Texas from El Paso. The aggregate value of the total consideration Enterprise paid or issued to complete the GulfTerra Merger was approximately $4 billion. As a result of the GulfTerra Merger, GulfTerra and GulfTerra GP became wholly owned subsidiaries of Enterprise on September 30, 2004. On October 1, 2004, we contributed our ownership interests in GulfTerra and GulfTerra GP to our Operating Partnership, which resulted in GulfTerra and GulfTerra GP becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. Formed in 1993, GulfTerra manages a balanced, diversified portfolio of interests and assets relating to the midstream energy sector, which involves gathering, transporting, separating, processing, fractionating and storing natural gas, oil and NGLs. GulfTerra’s interests and assets included (i) offshore oil and natural gas pipelines, platforms, processing facilities and other energy infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, primarily offshore Louisiana and Texas; (ii) onshore natural gas pipelines and processing facilities in Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas; (iii) onshore NGL pipelines and fractionation facilities in Texas; and (iv) onshore natural gas and NGL storage facilities in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. The South Texas midstream assets consisted of nine natural gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 1.9 Bcf/d, a 294-mile natural gas gathering system, a natural gas treating facility with a capacity of 150 MMcf/d and a small NGL pipeline. The GulfTerra Merger transactions The GulfTerra Merger occurred in several interrelated transactions as described below. • Step One. On December 15, 2003, Enterprise purchased a 50% membership interest in GulfTerra GP from El Paso for $425 million in cash. GulfTerra GP owns a 1% general partner interest in GulfTerra. Prior to completion of the GulfTerra Merger, Enterprise accounted for its investment in GulfTerra GP using the equity method of accounting. The $425 million in funds required to complete Step One were borrowed under an Interim Term Loan and our pre-merger revolving credit facilities. This amount was fully repaid with the net proceeds from equity offerings completed during 2004. For additional information regarding changes in our debt obligations since December 31, 2003, please see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. • Step Two. On September 30, 2004, the GulfTerra Merger was consummated and GulfTerra and GulfTerra GP became wholly owned subsidiaries of Enterprise. The GulfTerra Merger was accounted for using purchase accounting. Step Two of the GulfTerra Merger included the following transactions: • Immediately prior to closing the GulfTerra Merger, Enterprise GP acquired El Paso’s remaining 50% membership interest in GulfTerra GP for $370 million in cash paid to El Paso and the issuance of a 9.9% membership interest in Enterprise GP to El Paso. Subsequently, Enterprise GP contributed this 50% membership interest in GulfTerra GP to us without the receipt of additional general partner interest, common units or other consideration. Enterprise GP borrowed the foregoing $370 million from Dan Duncan LLC (which owns a membership interest in Enterprise GP), which obtained the funds from a loan from EPCO (which indirectly owns the remaining membership interests in Enterprise GP). • Immediately prior to closing the GulfTerra Merger, Enterprise paid $500 million in cash to El Paso for 10,937,500 Series C units of GulfTerra and 2,876,620 common units of GulfTerra. The remaining 57,762,369 GulfTerra common units (7,433,425 of which were owned by El Paso) were converted into 44 Table of Contents 104,549,823 Enterprise common units (13,454,499 of which are held by El Paso) at the time of the consummation of the GulfTerra Merger. • Step Three. Immediately after Step Two was completed, Enterprise acquired certain South Texas midstream assets from El Paso for $155.3 million in cash. Pursuant to written agreements, our purchase of the South Texas midstream assets was effective September 1, 2004. In connection with the closing of the GulfTerra Merger, on September 30, 2004, our Operating Partnership borrowed an aggregate $2.8 billion under its new revolving credit facilities to fund its cash payment obligations under Step Two and Step Three of the GulfTerra Merger and related transactions, including the tender offers for GulfTerra’s outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes. In connection with the GulfTerra Merger, we are required under a consent decree to sell our 50% interest in Starfish, which owns the Stingray natural gas pipeline and related gathering pipelines and dehydration and other facilities located in south Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico offshore Louisiana by March 31, 2005. In January 2005, we entered into a contract with a third party to sell this investment for approximately $41.2 million. We expect to close this sale during the first quarter of 2005. The sale requires FTC approval under the terms of the consent decree relating to the GulfTerra Merger and is subject to other customary closing conditions. Additionally, under the same consent decree, we were required to sell our undivided 50% interest in a Mississippi propane storage facility by December 31, 2004. We sold our interest in this facility during the fourth quarter of 2004. For additional information regarding the GulfTerra Merger and our other business combinations and asset acquisitions completed during 2004 (including selected pro forma financial information), please read Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Acquisition of El Paso’s Interests in Enterprise and Enterprise GP by affiliates of EPCO. In January 2005, affiliates of EPCO acquired a 9.9% membership interest in Enterprise GP and 13,454,499 Enterprise common units from El Paso for approximately $425 million in cash. As a result of these transactions, EPCO and its affiliates own 100% of the membership interests of Enterprise GP and approximately 37.4% of our total outstanding common units. El Paso no longer owns any interest in us or Enterprise GP. Agreement with Atwater Valley Producers Group for Deepwater Platform and Gas Pipeline. In November 2004, we entered into an agreement with the Atwater Valley Producers Group (consisting of Anadarko, Dominion, Kerr-McGee, Spinnaker and Devon) for the dedication, processing and gathering of natural gas and condensate production from several natural gas fields in the Atwater Valley, DeSoto Canyon and Lloyd Ridge areas of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We will design, construct, install and own Independence Hub, a 105-foot deep-draft, semi submersible platform with a two-level production deck, which will be capable of processing 850 MMcf/d of natural gas. The platform, which is estimated to cost approximately $385 million, will be operated by Anadarko. Cal Dive is our 20% joint venture partner in the Independence Hub Platform project. Additionally, we will construct, own, and operate the 134-mile Independence Trail natural gas pipeline system, which will have a throughput capacity of approximately 850 MMcf/d of natural gas. The pipeline system, which is estimated to cost $280 million, will transport production from the Independence Hub platform to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline. Rocky Mountain NGL pipeline expansion and related NGL fractionation projects. In January 2005, we started a project to expand our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionator to accommodate increased production of NGLs being transported to Mont Belvieu from the Rocky Mountain area. Our Mont Belvieu facility’s current fractionation capacity is up to 210 MBPD of mixed NGLs. This project, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2006 at an estimated total cost of $34.2 million, will increase total fractionation capacity at this facility by 15 MBPD and reduce its energy costs. Additionally, we are reviewing a proposal to construct a new NGL fractionator at our Mont Belvieu complex that could add an additional 60 MBPD of fractionation capacity at this industry hub. Currently, the Rocky Mountain segment of our Mid-America pipeline system transports up to 225 MBPD of NGLs from the major producing basins in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico to the Hobbs station on the Texas-New Mexico border. The Western Expansion Project would increase the capacity of this pipeline to 275 MBPD. Permitting, engineering and design work are in progress. We submitted a draft environmental assessment and plan of development to the appropriate regulatory agencies during the first quarter of 2005. Contingent upon 45 Table of Contents receiving all required permits and regulatory approvals, construction could begin as early as the fourth quarter of 2005. Acquisition of Indian Springs natural gas gathering and processing assets from El Paso. In January 2005, we paid El Paso $74.5 million for their membership interests in Teco Gas Gathering, LLC and Teco Gas Processing, LLC. As a result of this acquisition, we indirectly own an 80% equity interest in the 89-mile Indian Springs Gathering System and a 75% equity interest in the Indian Springs natural gas processing facility, both of which are located in East Texas. The Indian Springs processing facility has capacity to process up to 120 MMcf/d of natural gas and there is an idle 20 MMcf/d production train available for restart to support increases in natural gas volumes. The natural gas processed at the Indian Springs processing facility is sourced from the Indian Springs Gathering System, as well as our nearby Big Thicket Gathering System. February 2005 equity offering. In February 2005, we sold 17,250,000 common units (including the over-allotment amount of 2,250,000 common units which closed on March 11, 2005) to the public at an offering price of $27.05 per unit. Net proceeds from this offering, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contribution of $9.1 million, were approximately $456.5 million after deducting applicable underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses of $19.7 million. The net proceeds from this offering, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contribution, were used to repay our 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility, to temporarily reduce indebtedness outstanding under our Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility or for general partnership purposes. Acquisition of Additional Interests in Dixie Pipeline Company. We purchased an approximate 26% interest in Dixie from an affiliate of ChevronTexaco in February, 2005 for $40 million, and an approximate 20% interest in Dixie from an affiliate of ConocoPhillips in January, 2005 for $31 million. As a result of these acquisitions, our ownership interest in Dixie is now approximately 66% and will be a consolidated subsidiary. The other owners of Dixie are affiliates of BP with a 23% interest and ExxonMobil with an 11% interest. Dixie owns and operates the 1,301-mile Dixie Pipeline, which is a pipeline that transports propane from supply areas in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi to markets throughout the southeastern United States. The Dixie Pipeline is regulated by the FERC and transports an average of approximately 100 MBPD per day of propane. March 2005 private senior notes offering. On February 15, 2005, our Operating Partnership sold $500 million in principal amount of senior notes in a private offering, comprised of $250 million in principal amount of 10-year senior unsecured notes and $250 million in principal amount of 30-year senior unsecured notes. The 10-year notes (“Senior Notes I”) were issued at 99.379% of their principal amount and have fixed-rate interest of 5.00% and a maturity date of March 1, 2015. The 30-year notes (“Senior Notes J”) were issued at 98.691% of their principal amount and have fixed-rate interest of 5.75% and a maturity date of March 1, 2035. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes I and J to repay $350 million of indebtedness outstanding under Senior Notes A which was due on March 15, 2005 and the remaining proceeds for general partnership purposes, including the temporary repayment of indebtedness outstanding under the Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. This transaction closed on March 2, 2005. For additional information regarding our debt obligations, please read ""Liquidity and Capital Resources — Our Debt Obligations” included within this Item 7 discussion and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. March 2005 $4 Billion Universal Shelf Registration Filing. On March 3, 2005, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the issuance of $4 billion of partnership equity and public debt obligations. In connection with this registration statement, we also registered for resale 36,572,122 common units currently owned by Shell and 4,427,878 common units that had been sold by Shell to Kayne Anderson MLP Investment Company in December 2004. We are obligated to register the resale of these common units under a registration rights agreement we executed with Shell in connection with our acquisition of certain of Shell’s Gulf Coast midstream energy businesses in September 1999. For additional information regarding our equity and debt offerings, please read “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” included within this Item 7 discussion. 46 Table of Contents OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As a result of completing the GulfTerra Merger on September 30, 2004, our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes three months of results of operations from the GulfTerra assets. The effective closing date of our purchase of the South Texas midstream assets was September 1, 2004; thus, our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes four months of results of operations from the South Texas midstream assets. As a result of the GulfTerra Merger, we have reorganized our reportable business segments, as described below. We have also revised our prior segment information in order to conform to the current business segment operations and presentation. We have segregated our business activities into four reportable business segments: Offshore Pipelines & Services, Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, NGL Pipelines & Services, and Petrochemical Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the type of services rendered and products produced and/or sold. For a listing of the major components of each of our four new business segments, and the principal operating assets included within each of the major components, please read Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. The Offshore Pipelines & Services business segment consists of (i) approximately 1,150 miles of offshore natural gas pipelines strategically located to serve production areas in some of the most active drilling and development regions in the Gulf of Mexico, (ii) approximately 800 miles of Gulf of Mexico offshore crude oil pipeline systems and (iii) seven multi-purpose offshore hub platforms located in the Gulf of Mexico, which are included in our Offshore Pipelines & Services business segment. The Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services business segment consists of approximately 17,200 miles of onshore natural gas pipeline systems that provide for the gathering and transmission of natural gas in Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas. In addition, this segment includes two salt dome natural gas storage facilities located in Mississippi, which are strategically located to serve the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast domestic natural gas markets. This segment also includes leased natural gas storage facilities located in Texas and Louisiana. The NGL Pipelines & Services business segment includes our (i) natural gas processing business and related NGL marketing activities, (ii) NGL pipelines aggregating approximately 12,775 miles and related storage facilities, which include our strategic Mid-America and Seminole NGL pipeline systems and (iii) NGL fractionation facilities located in Texas and Louisiana. This segment also includes our import and export terminaling operations. The Petrochemical Services business segment includes four propylene fractionation facilities, an isomerization complex, and an octane additive production facility. This segment also includes various petrochemical pipeline systems. The Other non-segment category is presented for financial reporting purposes only to reflect the historical equity earnings we received from GulfTerra GP and our underlying investment in this entity at December 31, 2003. We acquired a 50% membership interest in GulfTerra GP on December 15, 2003 in connection with Step One of the GulfTerra Merger. Our investment in GulfTerra GP was accounted for using the equity method until the GulfTerra Merger was completed on September 30, 2004. On that date, GulfTerra GP became a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of ours. Since the historical equity earnings of GulfTerra GP were based on net income amounts allocated to it by GulfTerra, it is impractical for us to allocate the equity income we received during the periods presented to each of our new business segments. Therefore, we have segregated equity earnings from GulfTerra GP from our other segment results to aid in comparability between the periods presented. We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. 47 Table of Contents The GAAP measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. Our non-GAAP financial measure of total segment gross operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP operating income. We define total (or consolidated) segment gross operating margin as operating income before: (1) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; (2) operating lease expenses for which we do not have the payment obligation; (3) gains and losses on the sale of assets; and (4) selling, general and administrative expenses. Gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, provision for income taxes, minority interest, extraordinary charges and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses (net of the adjustments noted above) from segment revenues, with both segment totals before the elimination of intercompany transactions. We have historically included equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin and operating income. Our equity investments with industry partners are a vital component of our business strategy. They are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with those of our customers, which may be suppliers of raw materials or consumers of finished products. This method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand-alone basis. Many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations. Our integrated midstream energy asset system (including the midstream energy assets of our equity method investees) provides services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs and petrochemicals. Our asset system has multiple entry points. In general, hydrocarbons can enter our asset system through a number of ways, including an offshore natural gas or crude oil pipeline, an offshore platform, a natural gas processing plant, an NGL gathering pipeline, an NGL fractionator, an NGL storage facility, an NGL transportation or distribution pipeline or an onshore natural gas pipeline. At each link along this asset system, we earn revenues based on volume or an ownership of products such as NGLs. Many of our equity investees are present within our integrated midstream asset system. For example, we have ownership interests in several offshore natural gas and crude oil pipelines through our investments in Poseidon, Cameron Highway, Deepwater Gateway, Neptune and Nemo. We also have a number of investments in NGL transportation or distribution pipelines such as those owned by Belle Rose and Dixie (prior to our purchasing consolidating interests in Dixie in January and February 2005). Other examples include our use of the Promix NGL fractionator to process NGLs extracted by our gas plants. The NGLs received from Promix then can be sold in our NGL marketing activities. Given the integral nature of our equity investees to our operations, we believe treatment of earnings from our equity method investees as a component of gross operating margin and operating income is appropriate. For additional information regarding our investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates, please read Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. For additional information regarding our business segments, please read Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our gross operating margin by segment and in total is as follows for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Gross operating margin by segment: Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services $ 90,977 $ 18,345 $ 22,110 NGL Pipelines & Services 374,196 310,677 181,928 Petrochemical Services 121,515 75,885 117,776 Offshore Pipeline & Services 36,478 5,561 10,535 Other, non-segment 32,025 (53 ) — Total segment gross operating margin $ 655,191 $ 410,415 $ 332,349 48 Table of Contents For a reconciliation of non-GAAP gross operating margin to GAAP operating income and further to GAAP income before provision for taxes, minority interest and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, please read “Other Items” included within this Item 7 discussion on page 80 of this annual report.

Natural gas price is representative of Henry-Hub I-FERC. NGL prices are representative of Mont Belvieu Non-TET pricing. Refinery grade propylene represents an average of CMAI spot prices. Polymer-grade propylene represents average CMAI contract pricing. (2) Crude oil price is representative of an index price for West Texas Intermediate. (3) The Indicative Gas Processing Gross Spread is a relative measure used by the NGL industry as an indicator of the gross economic benefit derived from extracting NGLs from natural gas production on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Specifically, it is the amount by which the economic value of a composite gallon of NGLs exceeds the value of the equivalent amount of energy of natural gas based on NGL and natural gas prices on the U.S. Gulf Coast. It is assumed that a gallon of NGLs is comprised of 33% ethane, 32% propane, 11% normal butane, 8% isobutane and 16% natural gasoline. The value of a composite gallon of NGLs is determined by multiplying these component percentages by industry index prices listed in the table above. The value of the equivalent amount of energy of natural gas to one gallon of NGLs is 8.9% of the price of a MMBtu of natural gas. The Indicative Gas Processing Gross Spread does not consider the operating and fuel costs incurred by a natural gas processing plant to extract the NGLs nor the transportation and fractionation costs to deliver the NGLs and natural gas to market. 49 Table of Contents Our significant throughput, production and processing volumetric data were as follows for the periods indicated (on a net basis, taking into account our ownership interests): For Year Ended December 31, 2004 (1) 2003(1) 2002(1) Offshore Pipelines & Services, net: Natural gas transportation volumes (BBtus/d) (2) 2,081 433 500 Crude oil transportation volumes (MBPD) 138 Platform gas treating (BBtus/d) 306 Platform oil treating (MBPD) 14 Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, net: Natural gas transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 5,638 600 701 NGL Pipelines & Services, net: NGL transportation volumes (MBPD) 1,411 1,275 1,306 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 307 227 235 Equity NGL production (MBPD) 129 43 73 Fee-based natural gas processing (MMcf/d) 1,692 194 Petrochemical Services, net: Butane isomerization volumes (MBPD) 76 77 84 Propylene fractionation volumes (MBPD) 56 57 55 Octane additive production volumes (MBPD) 10 4 5 Petrochemical transportation volumes (MBPD) 71 68 46 Total, net: NGL, crude oil and petrochemical transportation volumes (MBPD) 1,620 1,343 1,352 Natural gas transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 7,719 1,033 1,201 Equivalent transportation volumes (MBPD)(3) 3,651 1,615 1,668 (1) Volumetric data shown above reflects net operating rates of the underlying assets for the periods in which we owned them.

The following table summarizes our consolidated revenues, costs and expenses, equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates and operating income for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 8,321,202 $ 5,346,431 $ 3,584,783 Operating costs and expenses 7,904,336 5,046,777 3,382,839 Selling, general and administrative costs 46,659 37,590 42,890 Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates 52,787 (13,960 ) 35,253 Operating income 422,994 248,104 194,307 Interest expense 155,740 140,806 101,580 Net income 268,261 104,546 95,500 Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2004 with Year Ended December 31, 2003 Revenues for 2004 increased $3.0 billion over those recorded during 2003. The increase in revenues is primarily due to (i) higher revenues from our NGL and petrochemical marketing activities due to increased sales volumes and prices and (ii) the addition of revenues from businesses acquired or consolidated during 2004, including GulfTerra, the South Texas midstream assets and BEF. Costs and expenses increased $2.9 billion period-to-period primarily due to (i) an increase in volumes purchased including the effects of higher product prices which resulted in an increase in the cost of sales of our NGL and petrochemical marketing activities and (ii) the addition of costs and expenses attributable to assets acquired or consolidated during 2004. These increases in costs and expenses were partially offset by a gain on sale of assets of approximately $15.1 million related to the satisfaction of certain contractual requirements of a joint venture 50 Table of Contents participation agreement whereby a 50% interest in Cameron Highway was sold. Approximately $10.1 million of this gain was the non-cash recognition of a long-term receivable that is due no later than December 31, 2006 while $5.0 million of the gain was associated with a contractually required cash payment received during the fourth quarter of 2004. Our equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $66.7 million period-to-period. The equity earnings we recorded for 2003 were impacted by a $22.5 million non-cash asset impairment charge associated with our octane enhancement business, BEF. The 2004 period includes $32 million of equity earnings from GulfTerra GP, which we began consolidating on September 30, 2004, as a result of completing the GulfTerra Merger. Additionally, 2004 includes the addition of equity earnings from investments acquired or consolidated during 2004, including VESCO and the investments we acquired in the GulfTerra Merger. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, operating income for 2004 increased $174.9 million from that recorded during 2003. Total segment gross operating margin increased $244.8 million year-to-year due to the same general reasons underlying the increase in operating income. Operating income includes costs such as depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses that are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure of total segment gross operating margin. Net income increased $163.8 million to $268.3 million for 2004 compared to $104.5 million for 2003. Net income for 2004 included a $14.9 million increase in interest expense due to acquisition-related borrowings offset by a $10.8 million benefit associated with the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles adopted during 2004. For additional information regarding the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles we recorded during 2004, please read “Other Items” included within this Item 7 discussion. The following information highlights the significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment; selling, general and administrative costs; and interest expense: Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin for our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment was $91 million for 2004 compared to $18.3 million for 2003. The majority of the $72.7 million increase in gross operating margin for this segment is attributable to assets acquired in the GulfTerra Merger, including various onshore natural gas pipelines and the Petal and Hattiesburg natural gas storage facilities. Additionally, gross operating margin for our Acadian gas pipeline system increased $6.8 million period-to-period due to higher natural gas transportation volumes and natural gas sales margins during 2004. The natural gas throughput volumes on our Acadian system were 595 BBtus/d for 2004 compared to 550 BBtus/d for 2003. NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from NGL Pipelines & Services segment was $374.2 million for 2004 compared to $310.7 million for 2003. Gross operating margin for natural gas processing increased $81.4 million period-to-period due to improved processing economics in 2004; the addition of gross operating margin attributable to assets acquired in the GulfTerra Merger, including the Chaco, Indian Basin and South Texas natural gas processing facilities; both partially offset by lower results from our NGL marketing activities in 2004. Indicative gas processing gross spreads on the U.S. Gulf Coast averaged 18 CPG during 2004 compared to 9 CPG in 2003, which resulted in an increase in the amount of NGLs extracted. Equity NGL production was 129 MBPD for 2004 versus 43 MBPD in 2003. Natural gas processing volumes under contracts with fee-based components increased to 1,692 MMcf/d for 2004 from 194 MMcf/d in 2003 reflecting amendments to our natural gas processing contract mix. Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and storage services decreased $24.7 million period-to-period due to (i) a $4 million non-cash asset impairment charge we recognized in 2004 on an NGL storage facility; (ii) increased expenses associated with our pipeline integrity inspection program; and (iii) lower gross operating margin from our Lou-Tex NGL pipeline resulting from a 17 MBPD decrease in volumes due to our election to maximize total gross operating margin by diverting mixed NGLs and refinery-grade propylene to our other facilities. Partially offsetting these decreases, was improved gross operating margin from our Mid-America and Seminole pipelines resulting from a 10% increase in throughput volumes. Overall, net NGL transportation volumes were 1,411 MBPD for 2004 compared to 1,275 MBPD in 2003. 51 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation increased $6.8 million period-to-period. NGL fractionation volumes were 307 MBPD in 2004 compared to 227 MBPD in 2003. Gross operating margin from our Norco facility increased by $16.5 million primarily due to (i) a 16 MBPD increase in volumes resulting from an expansion completed in the fourth quarter of 2003 and (ii) the effect of higher prices on and an increase in NGL volumes sold by Norco that it earns ownership of through percent-of-liquids based fractionation contracts. Additionally, an increase in gross operating margin of $5.8 million is attributable to the South Texas fractionators which we acquired in the GulfTerra Merger. These increases were partially offset by a $14 million decrease in gross operating margin period-to-period from our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionator primarily attributable to the timing of gains and losses associated with the measurement of NGLs in storage pending fractionation and increased operating costs due to higher natural gas prices. Petrochemical Services. Gross operating margin from our Petrochemical Services segment was $121.5 million in 2004 compared to $75.9 million in 2003. Gross operating margin from octane enhancement increased $34.4 million period-to-period primarily due to (i) a non-cash asset impairment charge of $22.5 million recorded in 2003 related to our investment in BEF and (ii) consolidating the results of BEF after our acquisition of the remaining 33.3% ownership interest during the third quarter of 2004. Gross operating margin from propylene fractionation increased $10.1 million period-to-period primarily due to higher petrochemical marketing sales volumes, which benefited from the effects of higher polymer grade propylene prices in 2004. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin for our Offshore Pipelines & Services segment was $36.5 million for 2004 compared to $5.6 million for 2003. The $30.9 million increase in this segment is primarily attributable to assets acquired in the GulfTerra Merger, including various offshore oil and natural gas pipelines and offshore platforms. Partially offsetting this increase in gross operating margin is decreased equity earnings from our Neptune natural gas pipeline investment resulting from a decrease in volumes from the Brutus and Hickory fields and natural depletion of other production fields served by this system. Selling, general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative costs were $46.7 million for 2004 compared to $37.6 million during 2003. The $9.1 million increase is primarily attributable to assets acquired or consolidated during 2004. Interest expense. Interest expense increased to $155.7 million during 2004 from $140.8 million in 2003. The $14.9 million increase is primarily due to additional debt we incurred as a result of the GulfTerra Merger, partially offset by reduced loan cost amortization primarily related to our repayment during 2003 of the $1.2 billion senior unsecured 364-Day Term Loan which we used to fund the acquisition of our interests in the Mid-America and Seminole pipelines. Our weighted-average debt principal outstanding was $2.8 billion during 2004 compared to $2.0 billion during 2003. For additional information regarding our debt obligations and changes in our debt obligations since December 31, 2003, please read “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources — Our debt obligations,” included within this Item 7. Comparison of Year ended December 31, 2003 with Year Ended December 31, 2002 Revenues for 2003 increased $1.8 billion over those recorded during 2002. Likewise, costs and expenses increased $1.7 billion over those of 2002. The increase in revenues and costs and expenses is primarily due to higher product sales and purchase prices and the financial results of business acquisitions, both of which offset the effect of lower volumes at some of our pipelines and facilities. In addition, costs and expenses for 2002 includes a $51.3 million loss related to commodity hedging activities. In general, higher market prices result in increased revenues from our various marketing activities; however, these same higher prices also increase our cost of sales within these activities as feedstock and other purchase prices rise. In addition, higher natural gas market prices during 2003 increased energy-related costs for many of our businesses versus the same period in 2002. The weighted-average market price of NGLs was 57 CPG during 2003 versus 41 CPG during 2002. The market price of natural gas averaged $5.38 per MMBtu during 2003 versus $3.22 per MMBtu during 2002. When compared to 2002, volumes at some of our downstream pipelines and facilities were lower due to a combination of (i) decreased demand for NGLs, principally ethane, by the ethylene segment of the petrochemical 52 Table of Contents industry (the “ethylene industry”) and (ii) lower NGL extraction rates at domestic gas processing facilities. The most significant determinant of the relative economic value of NGLs is demand by the ethylene industry for use in manufacturing plastics and chemicals. During 2003, this industry operated at lower utilization rates when compared to 2002 primarily due to a recession in the domestic manufacturing sector. Also during 2003, as a result of the higher relative cost of NGLs to crude-based alternatives such as naphtha, the ethylene industry utilized crude-based feedstock alternatives in greater quantities than during 2002. The resulting weaker demand for NGLs by this industry limited the ability of NGL producers to sell at higher product prices, which in turn resulted in decreased NGL extraction rates during 2003. Equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $49.2 million year-to-year primarily due to a $36.4 million decrease in equity earnings from BEF. The $36.4 million decrease in equity earnings from BEF is primarily due to a $22.5 million asset impairment charge we recorded during the third quarter of 2003; increased facility downtime during 2003 for maintenance and economic reasons; and an overall decrease in MTBE sales margins. In addition to lower earnings from BEF, approximately $4.8 million of the overall decrease in equity earnings is due to a rate case settlement recorded by Starfish in 2002. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, operating income for 2003 increased $53.8 million from that posted during 2002. Total segment gross operating margin increased $78.1 million year-to-year due to the same general reasons underlying the increase in operating income. Operating income includes costs such as depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses that are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure of total segment gross operating margin. Net income increased $9 million to $104.5 million for 2003 compared to $95.5 million for 2002. Net income for 2003 reflected the $53.8 million increase in operating income discussed in the previous paragraph offset by a $39.2 million increase in interest expense due to acquisition-related borrowings. The following information highlights the significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment; selling, general and administrative costs; and interest expense: Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment was $18.3 million for 2003 compared to $22.1 million for 2002. The decrease in gross operating margin was primarily due to lower natural gas sales volumes attributable to an increase in natural gas prices period-to-period. Overall, natural gas throughput volumes were 600 BBtus/d during 2003 versus 701 BBtus/d during 2002. The market price of natural gas averaged $5.38 per MMBtu during 2003 versus $3.22 per MMBtu during 2002. NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from our NGL Pipelines & Services segment was $310.7 million for 2003 versus $181.9 million for 2002. Gross operating margin from natural gas processing increased $49.3 million period-to-period. Our results for 2002 include $51.3 million in commodity hedging losses, the underlying strategies of which were discontinued in 2002. Our commodity hedging results for 2003 were a gain of $0.2 million. Equity NGL production at our gas processing plants averaged 43 MBPD during 2003 compared to 73 MBPD during 2002. The decrease in equity NGL production year-to-year was largely attributable to reduced demand for NGLs, principally ethane, by the ethylene industry and higher natural gas prices relative to NGL prices, which caused most natural gas processors to minimize the amount of NGLs extracted at their facilities. During 2003, we renegotiated a number of our natural gas processing contracts. In general, our objective has been to convert our traditional keepwhole arrangements to either margin-band/keepwhole contracts, percent-of-liquids contracts or fee-based contracts. The goal of these renegotiations is to minimize our direct exposure to the volatility of natural gas prices, especially to the extent it increases the PTR cost we would pay under traditional keepwhole arrangements to the point that processing natural gas to extract NGLs becomes uneconomical for us. When NGL extraction is uneconomical, NGLs are left in the natural gas stream to the extent allowed while keeping the natural gas in compliance with pipeline quality specifications; thus reducing the amount of NGLs available for downstream activities such as pipeline transportation and NGL fractionation. 53 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and storage increased $66.5 million period-to-period. The increase in gross operating margin was primarily due to our acquisition of Mid-America and Seminole. These two systems earned gross operating margin of $156.3 million during 2003 on aggregate net volumes of 774 MBPD. The 2002 period includes $81.1 million in gross operating margin for the five months during 2002 that we owned interests in these systems (August through December). When compared to their historical operating rates, net pipeline transportation volumes on the Mid-America and Seminole systems recorded for 2003 were lower than those reported by these systems for the full year of 2002 primarily due to decreased demand for NGLs, principally ethane, by the ethylene industry and lower NGL extraction rates at regional gas processing facilities. Excluding the contributions of Mid-America and Seminole, gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and storage was $77.3 million for 2003 versus $86 million for 2002. Net pipeline throughput volumes (excluding Mid-America and Seminole) increased to 501 MBPD during 2003 from 463 MBPD during the 2002 period. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation improved $12.9 million year-to-year. The increase in NGL fractionation gross operating margin is primarily due to (i) mixed NGL measurement gains we recognized during 2003 at our Mont Belvieu facility and (ii) higher percent-of-liquids revenues during 2003 at Norco attributable to the general increase in NGL prices, both of which more than offset a decline in gross operating margin from our other NGL fractionation facilities generally due to lower volumes and higher energy-related costs. Net NGL fractionation volumes decreased to 227 MBPD during 2003 from 235 MBPD during 2002. The decrease in NGL fractionation volumes period-to-period was primarily due to lower NGL extraction rates at gas processing facilities and reduced demand for NGLs by the petrochemical industry. Petrochemical Services. Gross operating margin from our Petrochemical Services segment was $75.9 million for the 2003 period compared to $117.8 for the 2002 period. Gross operating margin from propylene fractionation declined $7.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower petrochemical marketing margins resulting from higher feedstock and energy-related operating costs. Net propylene fractionation volumes were 57 MBPD for 2003 compared to 55 MBPD during 2002. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization increased $6.8 million year-to-year. The increase in gross operating margin from isomerization was generally attributable to higher isomerization fees and by-product revenues, which were partially offset by lower volumes and higher energy-related operating costs. Isomerization volumes were 77 MBPD during the 2003 period compared to 84 MBPD during the 2002 period. Our equity and consolidated earnings from octane enhancement were a loss of $32.7 million for 2003 compared to equity income of $8.6 million during 2002. The $41.3 million decrease in equity earnings is primarily due to a $22.5 million impairment charge we recorded during the third quarter of 2003 for our share of an impairment charge recorded by BEF; increased downtime during 2003 for maintenance and economic reasons; and an overall decrease in MTBE sales margins. Net MTBE production from this facility decreased to 4 MBPD during 2003 from 5 MBPD during 2002. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from our Offshore Pipelines & Services segment was $5.6 million for 2003 compared to $10.5 million for 2002. Overall, natural gas throughput volumes were 433 BBtus/d during 2003 versus 500 BBtus/d during 2002. The decrease in gross operating margin is primarily due to a $4.8 million reduction in equity earnings from Starfish related to the settlement of a rate case in 2002. Selling, general and administrative costs. These expenses were $37.6 million for 2003 compared to $42.9 million during 2002. The 2002 period includes approximately $10.0 million that we paid to Williams for transition services associated with our acquisition of Mid-America and Seminole compared to $2.0 million paid in 2003 for these services. These payments ceased in February 2003 when we began operating these two pipeline systems. Interest expense. Interest expense increased to $140.8 million during 2003 from $101.6 million in 2002. The increase is primarily due to additional debt we incurred as a result of business acquisitions. Interest expense for 2003 includes $11.3 million of loan cost amortization related to the 364-Day Term Loan, which was incurred in July 2002 and fully repaid in February 2003. Our weighted-average debt principal outstanding was $2.0 billion during 2003 compared to $1.8 billion during 2002. 54 Table of Contents General outlook for 2005 We expect our business to be affected by the following key trends and events during 2005. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our expectations may vary materially from actual results. • Drilling activity in the major producing areas, including the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountains and San Juan, and the improving economy, have increased demand for our integrated midstream energy services. Over the next two years we expect large volumes of new production from both the deepwater and the Rockies to flow into our integrated system of assets. Our natural gas and NGL facilities in central Louisiana and our 50% owned Cameron Highway oil pipeline began receiving first production from the Mad Dog and Holstein developments in the Southern Green Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These volumes, along with oil volumes received by our 36% owned Poseidon oil pipeline from the Front Runner development, should steadily increase during 2005 as these developments ramp up to full production. In addition, we expect initial production from the K-2 and K-2 North fields to begin flowing into our facilities in mid-2005. • As a result of the continued strong demand for NGLs, most of our pipelines, fractionators and processing plants should continue to run at high utilization rates. The strength of the domestic and global economic recoveries should continue to drive increased demand for all forms of energy despite higher commodity prices. Our largest NGL consuming customers in the ethylene industry have seen strong demand for their products, which has enabled them to raise prices to mitigate higher fuel and feedstock costs. With the unusually high price of crude oil relative to natural gas, ethane and propane are the preferred feedstocks of the ethylene industry. With strong demand for their products, the ethylene industry has been operating at utilization rates in excess of 90%, which results in strong demand for all ethylene feedstocks. • As a result of the GulfTerra Merger, we significantly increased our midstream assets located in the Gulf of Mexico. We have several projects that have either recently started operations or are scheduled to become operational soon. For additional information regarding these projects and our other capital spending, please read “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capital Spending.” • The effects of Hurricane Ivan have reduced volumes delivered to some of our pipelines, natural gas processing and NGL fractionation facilities in eastern Louisiana since the middle of September 2004. We estimate that this reduction in volumes resulted in a $24 million decrease in gross operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2004. This amount is prior to any potential recoveries under our business interruption insurance. In December 2004, volumes to these pipelines and facilities started to increase and we expect the volumes to return to normal levels by mid-2005. OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses and debt service, are for capital expenditures, business acquisitions and distributions to our partners. We expect to fund our short-term needs for such items as operating expenses and sustaining capital expenditures with operating cash flows. Capital expenditures for long-term needs resulting from internal growth projects and business acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources (either separately or in combination) including cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under commercial bank credit facilities, the issuance of additional partnership equity and public or private placement debt. We expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash flows. For additional information regarding our quarterly cash distributions, please read Item 5 of this annual report. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and/or refinancing arrangements. As noted above, certain of our liquidity and capital resource requirements are fulfilled by borrowings made under debt agreements and/or proceeds from the issuance of additional partnership equity. At December 31, 2004, 55 Table of Contents we had approximately $4.3 billion in principal outstanding under various debt agreements. For additional information regarding our debt, please read “- Our debt obligations.” As a result of our growth objectives, we expect to access debt and equity capital markets from time-to-time and we believe that additional financing arrangements to support our goals can be obtained on reasonable terms. Furthermore, we believe that maintenance of an investment grade credit rating combined with continued ready access to debt and equity capital at reasonable rates and sufficient trade credit to operate our businesses efficiently provide a solid foundation to meet our long and short-term liquidity and capital resource requirements. Registration Statements In February 2001, we filed a universal shelf registration with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $500 million of partnership equity or public debt obligations. In October 2002, we sold 9,800,000 common units under this shelf registration statement from which we received net proceeds of $182.5 million, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contribution of $3.7 million. In January 2003, we sold an additional 14,662,500 common units under this shelf registration from which we received net proceeds of $258.1 million, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contribution of $5.2 million. We used the net proceeds from these equity offerings to reduce debt outstanding under our 364-Day Term Loan and for working capital purposes. After deducting for these issuances of common units in October 2002 and January 2003, practically all of the available capacity under this shelf registration statement was used. In January 2003, we filed a new $1.5 billion universal shelf registration statement with the SEC covering the issuance of an unallocated amount of partnership equity or public debt obligations (separately or in combination). Sine June 2003, we have sold 63,410,317 common units under this registration statement. • In June 2003, we sold 11,960,000 common units under this shelf registration statement from which we received net proceeds of $261.1 million, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contribution of $5.2 million. We used the net proceeds from this offering to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. • In May 2004, we sold 17,250,000 common units under this registration statement from which we received net proceeds of $353.1 million, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contribution of $7.1 million. We used the proceeds from this public offering to repay the $225 million Interim Term Loan and to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. • In August 2004, we sold 17,250,000 common units under this registration statement from which we received net proceeds of $341.2 million, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contribution of $6.8 million. We used $210 million of the proceeds from this public offering to reduce borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and the remainder to fund our payment obligations to El Paso under Step Two of the GulfTerra Merger. • In October and November 2004, we sold 1,950,317 common units under this registration statement from which we received net proceeds of $39.6 million, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contributions. These common units were issued as a result of the conversion of GulfTerra’s 80 outstanding Series F2 convertible units, which we assumed as a result of the merger, into Enterprise common units. • In February 2005, we sold 17,250,000 common units under this registration statement (including the over-allotment amount of 2,250,000 common units which closed on March 11, 2005) from which we received net proceeds of approximately $456.5 million, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contribution of $9.1 million. We used the proceeds from this public offering to repay our 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility, to temporarily reduce indebtedness outstanding under our Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility or for general partnership purposes. After deducting for these issuances of common units in 2003, 2004 and 2005, practically all of the available capacity under this shelf registration statement has been used. On March 3, 2005, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the issuance of $4 billion of partnership equity and public debt 56 Table of Contents obligations. In connection with this registration statement, we also registered for resale 36,572,122 common units currently owned by Shell and 4,427,878 common units owned by third party, Kayne Anderson. Shell sold these unregistered units to Kayne Anderson in December 2004. We are obligated to register the resale of these common units for Shell under a registration rights agreement we executed with Shell in connection with our acquisition of certain of Shell’s Gulf Coast midstream energy businesses in September 1999. In July 2003, we filed a registration statement with the SEC covering 5,000,000 common units issuable under the Distribution Reinvestment Plan (or “DRIP”). In April 2004, we filed a new registration statement with the SEC covering an additional 10,000,000 common units issuable under the DRIP. The new registration statement increased the number of common units issuable under the DRIP from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they would otherwise receive in the purchase of additional common units. We expect to use the cash generated from this reinvestment program primarily for general partnership purposes. Initial reinvestments under the DRIP occurred in August 2003. For all of 2003, we issued 2,883,803 common units in connection with the DRIP and received proceeds (including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contributions) of approximately $60.3 million. During 2004, we issued 5,183,591 common units in connection with the DRIP and received proceeds (including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contributions) of approximately $111.6 million. To support our growth objectives and financial flexibility, EPCO reinvested approximately $177.5 million of its cash distributions from August 2003 through February 2005 through the DRIP. Class B special units In December 2003, we sold 4,413,549 Class B special units to an affiliate of EPCO for $100 million in a private transaction. Enterprise GP contributed approximately $2 million in connection with this offering in order to maintain its ownership interest. We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay $100 million of the debt we incurred to finance our December 2003 purchase of a 50% interest in GulfTerra GP and the remainder for general partnership purposes. Upon receipt of unitholder approval on July 29, 2004, our 4,413,549 Class B special units converted to an equal number of common units. This conversion resulted in a reclassification of the $99 million capital account balance for the Class B special units to common units. Series F2 convertible units assumed in connection with the GulfTerra Merger In May 2003, GulfTerra issued 80 Series F convertible units in a registered offering to an institutional investor. Each Series F convertible unit was comprised of two separate detachable units — a Series F1 convertible unit and a Series F2 convertible unit — that had identical terms except for vesting and termination dates and the number of common units into which they may be converted. Prior to the GulfTerra Merger, all the Series F1 convertible units were converted. As a result of the GulfTerra Merger, we assumed GulfTerra’s obligations associated with the 80 Series F2 convertible units. All Series F2 convertible units outstanding at the merger date were converted into rights to receive Enterprise common units. The number of Enterprise common units and the price per unit at conversion were adjusted based on the 1.81 exchange ratio. The Series F2 convertible units were convertible into up to $40 million of Enterprise common units. On October 29, 2004, 60 of the 80 outstanding Series F2 convertible units were converted into 1,458,434 Enterprise common units. As a result of this conversion, we received a payment of $30 million from the holder of the Series F2 convertible units (representing a conversion price of $20.57 per Enterprise common unit). Net proceeds from this conversion, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate capital contribution of $0.6 million, were $29.7 million after deducting transaction costs of $0.9 million. On November 8, 2004, the remaining 20 outstanding Series F2 convertible units were converted into 491,883 Enterprise common units. As a result of this conversion, we received a payment of $10 million from the holder of the Series F2 convertible units (representing a conversion price of $20.33 per Enterprise common unit). Net proceeds from this conversion, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate capital contribution of $0.2 million, were $9.9 million after deducting transaction costs of $0.3 million. 57 Table of Contents CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES The following discussions highlight significant year-to-year comparisons in consolidated operating, investing and financing cash flows: For Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net income $ 268,261 $ 104,546 $ 95,500 Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash flows provided by (operating activities before changes in operating accounts): Depreciation and amortization in operating costs and expenses 193,734 115,642 86,029 Depreciation and amortization in selling, general and administrative costs 1,650 159 77 Amortization in interest expense 3,503 12,634 8,819 Equity in (income) loss of unconsolidated affiliates (52,787 ) 13,960 (35,253 ) Distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates 68,027 31,882 57,662 Provision for impairment of long-lived asset 4,114 1,200 Gain on sale of assets (15,901 ) (16 ) (1 ) Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles (10,781 ) Changes in fair market value of financial instruments 5 (29 ) 10,213 Increase in restricted cash (12,305 ) (5,100 ) (2,999 ) Other 25,441 23,839 14,060 Cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating accounts 472,961 298,717 234,107 Net effect of changes in operating accounts (93,725 ) 120,888 92,655 Operating activities cash flows $ 379,236 $ 419,605 $ 326,762 Cash flows from operating activities primarily reflect net income adjusted for depreciation, amortization and similar non-cash amounts; equity earnings and cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates and changes in operating accounts. The net effect of changes in operating accounts is generally the result of timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for purchases and other expenses near the end of each period. For additional information regarding changes in operating accounts, please read Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. In addition, operating cash inflows and outflows related to increases or decreases in inventory are influenced by changes in commodity prices and our marketing activities. Cash flow from operations is primarily based on earnings from our business activities. As a result, these cash flows are exposed to certain risks. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy sector, which includes gathering, transporting, processing, fractionating and storing natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. In general, we provide services for producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from the wellhead to the end user. The products that we process, sell or transport are principally used as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating, feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing, and in the production of motor gasoline. Reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers, whether because of general economic conditions, reduced demand for the end products made with our products or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons could have a negative impact on our earnings and thus the availability of cash from operating activities. Other risks include fluctuations in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, competitive practices in the midstream energy industry and the impact of operational and systems risks. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, please read “Risk Factors” included within this Item 7 discussion. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2004 with Year Ended December 31, 2003 Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $379.2 million during 2004 compared to $419.6 million for 2003. As shown in the preceding table, cash flow before the net effect of changes in operating accounts was an inflow of $473 million for 2004 versus $298.7 million for 2003. We believe that cash flow from operating activities before the net effect of changes in operating accounts is an important measure of our ability to generate core cash flows from our assets and other investments. The $174.3 million increase in this element of our cash flows is primarily due to: 58 Table of Contents • earnings from the assets we acquired in the GulfTerra Merger and in our purchase of the South Texas midstream assets, which occurred on September 30, 2004; • the 2004 period including a gain on sale of assets of approximately $15.1 million related to the satisfaction of certain contractual requirements of a joint venture participation agreement whereby a 50% interest in Cameron Highway was sold; offset by • higher interest costs associated with debt incurred and issued to fund our cash payment obligations associated with the GulfTerra Merger. Distributions received from our equity method unconsolidated affiliates were $68 million for 2004 compared to $31.9 million for 2003 and equity income received from our equity method unconsolidated affiliates was $52.8 million for 2004 compared to a loss of $14.0 million for 2003. The increases in these components of our cash flows is primarily due to cash distributions and equity income received from GulfTerra GP and VESCO, offset by the effects of consolidating former equity method investments as a result of acquisitions. As a result of the GulfTerra Merger, GulfTerra GP became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report). Additionally, on July 1, 2004, we changed our method of accounting for VESCO from the cost method to the equity method in accordance with EITF 03-16 (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report). The period-to-period fluctuation in the restricted cash balance is primarily due to the timing of physical purchases of natural gas on the NYMEX exchange. Investing activities. During 2004, we used $929.1 million in cash for investing activities compared to $657 million in 2003. We used $638.8 million during 2004 to complete the GulfTerra Merger, including our purchase of the South Texas midstream assets. Additionally, during 2004, we used $85.9 million to purchase certain assets located near Morgan’s Point, Texas, an additional 16.7% membership interest in Tri-States, a 10% equity interest in Seminole and the remaining 33.3% ownership interest in BEF. During 2003, we used $37.3 million primarily to purchase the Port Neches Pipeline, the remaining 50% ownership interest in EPIK, an additional 33.3% interest in BEF, an additional 37.4% interest in Wilprise and the remaining 50% interest in OTC. Capital expenditures were $146.9 million for 2004 versus $145.9 million for 2003. For additional information regarding our capital expenditures, please read “Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates were $64.4 million for 2004 compared to $471.9 million for 2003. During 2004, we used $27.5 million to purchase an additional 16.7% interest in Promix and we contributed $24 million to Cameron Highway for the construction of the Cameron Highway oil pipeline. The 2003 period included our payment of $425 million to El Paso for a 50% ownership interest in GulfTerra GP and amounts we contributed to our Gulf of Mexico natural gas pipeline investments for their expansion capital projects. Financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities during 2004 was $544 million compared to $254 million in 2003. During 2004, we had net borrowings under our debt agreements of $125.6 million compared to net repayments of $106.8 million for 2003. On September 30, 2004, we borrowed approximately $2.8 million under our new 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility and Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility to (a) fund $655.3 million in cash payment obligations to El Paso under Steps Two and Three of the GulfTerra Merger transactions, (b) escrow $1.1 billion to finance our tender offers for GulfTerra’s senior and senior subordinated notes and (c) extinguish $962 million outstanding under GulfTerra’s revolving credit facility and secured term loans. Additionally, on October 4, 2004, we issued $2 billion in senior notes (Senior Notes E, F, G and H). Our repayments of debt during 2004 reflect the use of proceeds from our May 2004 and August 2004 equity offerings to repay the $225 million Interim Term Loan and to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under our pre-merger revolving credit facilities and the use of proceeds from our October 2004 issuance of senior notes to reduce debt amounts outstanding under our 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility. Additionally, on October 5, 2005, we used the $1.1 billion in escrowed funds to complete our cash tender offers for substantially all of GulfTerra’s senior and senior subordinated notes. The 2003 period reflects our issuance of Senior Notes C ($350 million in principal amount) and Senior Notes D ($500 million in principal amount), and a $425 million borrowing under our Interim Term Loan which was used to purchase a 50% interest in GulfTerra GP. Repayments of debt during 2003 reflect the use of proceeds from equity offerings completed in January, June, August and December and the final repayment of 59 Table of Contents $1 billion that was outstanding under the bridge loan financing we used to purchase interest in the Mid-America and Seminole pipelines. Cash distributions to partners increased from $309.9 million during 2003 to $438.8 million during 2004. The increase in cash distributions is primarily due to an increase in both the declared quarterly distribution rates and the number of units eligible for distributions. We expect that future cash distributions to partners will increase as a result of our periodic issuance of common units under the DRIP and other equity offerings. Net proceeds from the issuance of common units were $846.1 million for 2004 compared to $573.7 million for 2003. Both amounts include Enterprise GP’s net proportionate capital contributions. In May 2004, we sold 17,250,000 common units to the public (including the underwriters’ over-allotment amount of 2,250,000 common units) at an offering price of $21.00 per unit. Net proceeds from this offering, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contribution of $7.1 million, were $353.1 million after deducting applicable underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses of $16.3 million. In August 2004, we sold 17,250,000 common units to the public (including the underwriters’ over-allotment amount of 2,250,000 common units) at an offering price of $20.20 per unit. Net proceeds from this offering, including Enterprise GP’s proportionate net capital contribution of $6.8 million, were approximately $341.2 million after deducting applicable underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses of $13.9 million. The 2004 period also includes $111.6 million in proceeds from the sale of 5,183,591 common units in connection with the DRIP, the proceeds of which were primarily used for general partnership purposes, and $39.6 million in proceeds from the conversion of 80 Series F2 convertible units into 1,950,317 common units. Proceeds from the issuance of common units during 2003 reflect the sale of 14,662,500 and 11,960,000 common units in our January 2003 and June 2003 equity offerings, respectively, and the sale of 2,883,803 common units in connection with the DRIP. Additionally, the 2003 period reflects the sale of 4,413,549 Class B special units to an affiliate of EPCO in December 2003. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2003 with Year Ended December 31, 2002 Operating cash flows. Cash provided by operating activities was $419.6 million during 2003 compared to $326.8 million during 2002. As shown in the preceding table, cash flow before the net effect of changes in operating accounts was an inflow of $298.7 million during 2003 versus $234.1 million during 2002. The $64.6 million increase in this element of our cash flows is primarily due to: • earnings from newly acquired businesses which are included in the 2003 period but not in the 2002 period (particularly those of Mid-America and Seminole, which we acquired in July 2002); • the 2002 period including $51.3 million of commodity hedging losses versus $0.6 million of such losses during the 2003 period; offset by • higher interest costs associated with debt we incurred and issued since the first quarter of 2002 to finance acquisitions. Distributions and equity income received from our equity method unconsolidated affiliates during 2003 decreased $25.8 million and $49.2 million, respectively, over those received in 2002. The decreases in these components of our cash flows are primarily due to consolidating former equity method investments as a result of acquisition. Additionally, the 2003 period reflects a decrease in equity earnings from BEF primarily due to a $22.5 million asset impairment charge we recorded during the third quarter of 2003. Investing cash flows. During 2003, we used $657.0 million in cash for investing activities compared to $1.7 billion during 2002. We used $37.3 million and $1.6 billion for business acquisitions during 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2002 period reflects our acquisition of interests in the Mid-America and Seminole pipelines from Williams and propylene fractionation and NGL and petrochemical storage assets from Diamond-Koch. The 2003 period includes only minor acquisitions, specifically the Port Neches pipeline and additional interests in EPIK, BEF, Wilprise and OTC. Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates increased to $471.9 million during 2003 compared to $13.7 million during 2002. The 2003 period includes our payment of $425 million to El Paso for a 50% 60 Table of Contents ownership interest in the general partner of GulfTerra in December 2003. The remaining $33.2 million year-to-year increase is primarily due to funding our share of the expansion projects of our Gulf of Mexico natural gas pipeline investments and our purchase of an additional interest in Tri-States. Our capital expenditures were $145.9 million during 2003 versus $72.1 million during 2002. The $73.8 million increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to expansions of our Norco NGL fractionator and Neptune gas processing facility. Financing cash flows. Cash provided by financing activities during 2003 was $254 million compared to $1.3 billion during 2002. During 2003, we made net payments on our debt obligations of $106.8 million. Our borrowings during 2003 include the issuance of Senior Notes C ($350 million in principal amount), Senior Notes D ($500 million in principal amount) and the $425 million borrowing under the Interim Term Loan (to purchase a 50% interest in the general partner of GulfTerra). Our repayments during 2003 include the use of proceeds from equity offerings completed in January, June, August and December. The 2002 period primarily reflects borrowings to fund the Mid-America and Seminole acquisitions and those of Diamond-Koch’s propylene fractionation business. Proceeds from our common unit and Class B special unit equity offerings during 2003 totaled $675.7 million, which includes Enterprise GP’s related $7.8 million contribution to us. Enterprise GP also contributed $5.9 million to our Operating Partnership in connection with these offerings. Distributions to our partners and minority interests increased to $318.0 million during 2003 from $218.2 million during 2002. The $99.8 million increase in distributions to partners is primarily due to increases in both the declared quarterly distribution rates and the number of units eligible for distributions. 61 Table of Contents OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS Our debt consisted of the following at the dates indicated: December 31, 2004 2003 Operating Partnership debt obligations: Interim Term Loan, variable rate, repaid in May 2004(1) $ 225,000 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility, variable rate, terminated in September 2004(2) 70,000 Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility, variable rate, terminated in September 2004(2) 115,000 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility, variable rate, repaid in February 2005(3, 4) $ 242,229 Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility, variable rate, due September 2009(2,4) 321,000 Seminole Notes, 6.67% fixed-rate, $15 million due in December 2005(5) 15,000 30,000 Pascagoula MBFC Loan, 8.70% fixed-rate, due March 2010 54,000 54,000 Senior Notes A, 8.25% fixed-rate, repaid March 2005 350,000 350,000 Senior Notes B, 7.50% fixed-rate, due February 2011 450,000 450,000 Senior Notes C, 6.375% fixed-rate, due February 2013 350,000 350,000 Senior Notes D, 6.875% fixed-rate, due March 2033 500,000 500,000 Senior Notes E, 4.00% fixed-rate, due October 2007 500,000 Senior Notes F, 4.625% fixed-rate, due October 2009 500,000 Senior Notes G, 5.60% fixed-rate, due October 2014 650,000 Senior Notes H, 6.65% fixed-rate, due October 2034 350,000 GulfTerra debt obligations:(5) Senior Notes, 6.25% fixed-rate, due June 2010 (6) 750 Senior Subordinated Notes, 8.50% fixed-rate, due June 2010 3,858 Senior Subordinated Notes, 8.50% fixed-rate, due June 2011 1,777 Senior Subordinated Notes, 10.625% fixed-rate, due December 2012 84 Total principal amount 4,288,698 2,144,000 Net unamortized discounts (9,239 ) (5,983 ) Other 1,777 1,531 Subtotal long-term debt 4,281,236 2,139,548 Less current maturities of debt(7) (15,000 ) (240,000 ) Long-term debt $ 4,266,236 $ 1,899,548 Standby letters of credit outstanding(8) $ 139,052 $ 1,300 (1) We used the proceeds from our May 2004 common unit offering to fully repay and terminate the Interim Term Loan. (2) These facilities were terminated on September 30, 2004, and replaced by a new Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility having $750 million of borrowing capacity due September 2009. (3) We used the proceeds from our February 2005 common unit offering to fully repay and terminate the 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility. (4) These facilities became effective concurrently with the closing of the GulfTerra Merger on September 30, 2004. The new $750 million Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility replaced the $230 million 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility and the $270 million then existing Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. The $750 million borrowing capacity is reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit outstanding. (5) Solely as it relates to the assets of our GulfTerra and Seminole subsidiaries, our senior indebtedness is structurally subordinated and ranks junior in right of payment to indebtedness of GulfTerra and Seminole. (6) Remaining notes outstanding were called and retired in February 2005. (7) In accordance with SFAS No. 6, “Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to Be Refinanced,” long-term and current maturities of debt at December 31, 2004 reflected (i) our refinancing of Senior Notes A with proceeds from our Senior Notes I and J in March 2005 and (ii) the repayment of our 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility using proceeds from an equity offering completed in February 2005. Our classification of current maturities of debt at December 31, 2003 reflected our option and ability to convert any revolving credit balance outstanding at maturity under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility to a one-year term loan (which would have been due October 2005) in accordance with the terms of the agreement. (8) Of the $139 million standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004, $24 million were issued under our Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility, and the remaining $115 million is associated with a letter of credit facility we entered into in November 2004 in connection with our Independence Hub capital project. 62 Table of Contents General description of consolidated debt The following is a summary of the significant aspects of our debt obligations at December 31, 2004: Parent-Subsidiary guarantor relationships. We act as guarantor of the debt obligations of our Operating Partnership, with the exception of the Seminole Notes and the senior and senior subordinated notes of GulfTerra. If the Operating Partnership were to default on any debt we guarantee, we would be responsible for full repayment of that obligation. The Seminole Notes are unsecured obligations of Seminole Pipeline Company (of which we own an effective 88.4% of its capital stock). The senior and senior subordinated notes of GulfTerra are unsecured obligations of GulfTerra (of which we own 100% of its limited and general partnership interests). GulfTerra’s Senior Subordinated and Senior Notes. As a result of completing the GulfTerra Merger on September 30, 2004, we recorded in consolidation GulfTerra’s $921.5 million of outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes. Of this amount, $915 million was purchased on October 5, 2004 by our Operating Partnership pursuant to its tender offers. The note holders also approved amendments in connection with accepting the tender offers that removed all restrictive covenants governing the notes. For additional information regarding the tender offers, please read ” - 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility — Tender offers for GulfTerra senior and senior subordinated notes” within this general description of debt. In February 2005, we redeemed, at a premium, the remaining $0.8 million outstanding under GulfTerra’s 6.25% senior notes due June 2010. 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility. In August 2004, our Operating Partnership entered into a new 364-day credit agreement. The $2.25 billion Acquisition Credit Facility was an unsecured 364-day facility that was used to provide interim financing for certain transactions associated with the GulfTerra Merger, the refinancing of GulfTerra’s existing secured credit facility and term loans and the purchase of GulfTerra’s senior and senior subordinated notes in connection with our Operating Partnership’s tender offers for those notes. This facility became effective concurrent with the closing of the GulfTerra Merger and was to mature on September 29, 2005. In February 2005, we fully repaid and terminated the 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility using proceeds we received from our February 2005 common unit offering. For additional information regarding the February 2005 common unit offering, please read “Recent Developments” included within this Item 7 discussion. As defined by the credit agreement, variable interest rates charged under this facility generally bore interest, at our election at the time of each borrowing, at (1) the greater of (a) the Prime Rate or (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1/2% or (2) a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or (3) a Competitive Bid Rate. This credit agreement provided for the mandatory prepayment of loans and termination of commitments equal to the proceeds from and upon the consummation of any public or private debt or equity offerings by us on or after August 15, 2004, excluding equity issued with respect to our distribution reinvestment plan, employee unit purchase plan and the exercise of any outstanding options with respect to our common units. With the completion of our private offering of senior notes on October 4, 2004, we repaid approximately $2 billion borrowed under this facility, which reduced our borrowing capacity under this facility by an equal amount. This revolving credit agreement contained various covenants related to our ability to incur certain indebtedness; grant certain liens; enter into certain merger or consolidation transactions; and make certain investments. The loan agreement also required us to satisfy certain financial covenants at the end of each fiscal quarter. We are in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2004. Tender offers for GulfTerra senior and senior subordinated notes On August 4, 2004, in anticipation of completing the GulfTerra Merger, our Operating Partnership commenced four cash tender offers to purchase any and all of the outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes of GulfTerra having a total outstanding principal amount of approximately $921.5 million. In connection with the tender offers, GulfTerra executed supplements to the indentures governing these notes that eliminated certain restrictive covenants and default provisions contained in those indentures upon our purchase of more than a majority in principal amount of each series of the outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes. 63 Table of Contents Substantially all of the GulfTerra notes ($915 million of $921.5 million) were tendered pursuant to the tender offers. On September 30, 2004, we borrowed $1.1 billion under our 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility in anticipation of completing the tender offers and placed these funds in escrow. On October 5, 2004, our Operating Partnership purchased the notes for a total price of approximately $1.1 billion, which included $27 million related to consent payments. The following table shows the four GulfTerra senior debt obligations affected, including the principal amount of each series of notes tendered, as well as the payment made by Enterprise to complete the tender offers. Principal Cash payments made by Enterprise Amount Accrued Tender Total Description Tendered Interest Price (1) Paid 8.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2010 (Represents 98.2% of principal amount outstanding) $ 212,057 $ 6,209 $ 246,366 $ 252,575 10.625% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (Represents 99.9% of principal amount outstanding) 133,916 4,901 167,612 172,513 8.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 (Represents 99.5% of principal amount outstanding) 319,823 9,364 359,379 368,743 6.25% Senior Notes due 2010 (Represents 99.7% of principal amount outstanding) 249,250 5,366 274,073 279,439 Totals $ 915,046 $ 25,840 $ 1,047,430 $ 1,073,270 (1) Tender price includes consent payment of $30 per $1,000 principal amount tendered. Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In August 2004, our Operating Partnership entered into a five-year $750 million revolving credit agreement that includes a sublimit of $100 million for standby letters of credit. This facility became effective concurrent with the closing of the GulfTerra Merger and will mature on September 30, 2009. This facility replaced our then existing $270 million Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and $230 million 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility, which were terminated upon the effective date of the new facility. The Operating Partnership’s borrowings under this agreement are unsecured general obligations that are non-recourse to Enterprise GP. We have guaranteed repayment of amounts due under this revolving credit agreement through an unsecured guarantee. As defined by the credit agreement, variable interest rates charged under this facility generally bear interest, at our election at the time of each borrowing, at (1) the greater of (a) the Prime Rate or (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1/2% or (2) a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or (3) a Competitive Bid Rate. This revolving credit agreement contains various covenants similar to those of our 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility. We are in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2004. Senior Notes A, B, C and D. These fixed-rate notes are an unsecured obligation of our Operating Partnership and rank equally with its existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. They are senior to any future subordinated indebtedness. The Operating Partnership’s borrowings under these notes are non-recourse to Enterprise GP. We have guaranteed repayment of amounts due under these notes through an unsecured and unsubordinated guarantee. These notes are subject to make-whole redemption rights and were issued under an indenture containing certain covenants. These covenants restrict our ability, with certain exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2004. On March 15, 2005, we repaid the $350 million in indebtedness outstanding under Senior Notes A, using the proceeds we received from our issuance of Senior Notes I and J. 64 Table of Contents Senior Notes E, F, G and H. On September 23, 2004, our Operating Partnership priced a private offering of an aggregate of $2 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On October 4, 2004, these notes were issued. The interest rate, principal amount and net proceeds, before expenses, for each senior note in this offering are shown in the following table: Fixed Proceeds to Interest Principal Bond Us, Before Senior Note Issued Rate Amount Discount Expenses Senior Notes E, due October 2007 4.000 % $ 500,000 $ 2,140 $ 497,860 Senior Notes F, due October 2009 4.625 % 500,000 4,405 495,595 Senior Notes G, due October 2014 5.600 % 650,000 4,784 645,216 Senior Notes H, due October 2034 6.650 % 350,000 4,203 345,797 Totals $ 2,000,000 $ 15,532 $ 1,984,468 The net proceeds from this offering were used to reduce debt amounts outstanding under the Operating Partnership’s $2.25 billion 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility that was used to partially fund the GulfTerra Merger on September 30, 2004. These fixed-rate notes are unsecured obligations of our Operating Partnership and rank equally with its existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Operating Partnership’s borrowings under these notes are non-recourse to Enterprise GP. We have guaranteed repayment of amounts due under these notes through an unsecured and unsubordinated guarantee. These notes were issued under an indenture containing certain covenants, which restrict our ability, with certain exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. We are in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2004. On January 24, 2005, we filed a registration statement for an offer to exchange these notes for registered debt securities with identical terms. The exchange of notes was completed in March, 2005. Senior Notes I and J. On February 15, 2005, our Operating Partnership sold $500 million in principal amount of senior notes in a private offering, comprised of $250 million in principal amount of 10-year senior unsecured notes and $250 million in principal amount of 30-year senior unsecured notes. The 10-year notes (“Senior Notes I”) were issued at 99.379% of their principal amount and have fixed-rate interest of 5.00% and a maturity date of March 1, 2015. The 30-year notes (“Senior Note J”) were issued at 98.691% of their principal amount and have fixed-rate interest of 5.75% and a maturity date of March 1, 2035. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes I and J to repay $350 million of indebtedness outstanding under Senior Notes A which was due on March 15, 2005, and the remaining proceeds for general partnership purposes, including the temporary repayment of indebtedness outstanding under the Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. Pascagoula MBFC Loan. In connection with the construction of our Pascagoula, Mississippi natural gas processing plant, our Operating Partnership entered into a ten-year fixed-rate loan with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation (“MBFC”). This loan is subject to a make-whole redemption right and is guaranteed by us through an unsecured and unsubordinated guarantee. The Pascagoula MBFC Loan contains certain covenants including the maintenance of appropriate levels of insurance on the Pascagoula facility. We were in compliance with the covenants at December 31, 2004. The indenture agreement for this loan contains an acceleration clause whereby if our credit rating by Moody’s declines below Baa3 in combination with our credit rating at Standard & Poor’s remaining at BB+ or below, the $54 million principal balance of this loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest would become immediately due and payable 120 days following such event. If such an event occurred, we would have to either redeem the Pascagoula MBFC Loan or provide an alternative credit agreement to support our obligation under this loan. 65 Table of Contents Industrial Development Revenue Bonds. In April 2004, Petal Gas Storage L.L.C. (“Petal”), a wholly owned subsidiary of GulfTerra, borrowed $52 million from the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation (“MBFC”) pursuant to a loan agreement between Petal and the MBFC. On the same date, the MBFC issued $52 million in Industrial Development Revenue Bonds to another wholly owned subsidiary of GulfTerra. The loan agreement and the Industrial Development Revenue Bonds have identical fixed interest rates of 6.25% and maturities of fifteen years. The bonds and the associated tax exemptions are authorized under the Mississippi Business Finance Act. Petal may repay the loan agreement without penalty, and thus cause the Industrial Development Revenue Bonds to be redeemed, any time after one year from their date of issue. We have netted the loan amount and the bond amount of $52 million and the interest payable and interest receivable amount of $2.2 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004, we also netted the interest expense and interest income amounts of $0.8 million attributable to these instruments on our Statements of Consolidated Operations. Our presentation of the Industrial Development Revenue Bonds is reflected in accordance with the provisions of FIN No. 39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts”, and SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities”, since we have the ability and intent to offset these items. Loss due to write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. As a result of terminating our 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility and our previous Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility on September 30, 2004, we expensed $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. Information regarding variable interest rates paid The following table shows the range of interest rates paid and weighted-average interest rate paid on our variable-rate debt obligations during 2004. Weighted- Range of average interest rates interest rate paid paid Interim Term Loan (terminated May 2004) 1.72% to 1.78% 1.76 % 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility (terminated September 30, 2004) 1.72% to 4.00% 1.82 % Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility (terminated September 30, 2004) 1.67% to 4.25% 1.83 % 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility (effective September 30, 2004) 2.67% to 4.75% 3.50 % Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility (effective September 30, 2004) 2.64% to 5.25% 3.06 % Consolidated debt maturity table The following table shows scheduled maturities of the principal amounts of our debt obligations for the next 5 years and in total thereafter. Fiscal 2005 $ 15,000 ” 2007 500,000 ” 2009 821,000 Thereafter 2,952,698 Total scheduled principal to be repaid $ 4,288,698 In accordance with SFAS No. 6, “Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to Be Refinanced”, the amount shown in the table above for 2005 excludes the $242.2 million principal amount due under our 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility at December 31, 2004. We refinanced this short-term obligation using proceeds from an equity offering completed in February 2005. As a result, we have reclassified this amount to long-term debt and shown it as a component of principal amounts due after 2009. In addition, the long-term portion of our debt obligations at December 31, 2004 reflects our refinancing of the $350 million in principal amount Senior Notes A (due March 2005) with proceeds from our issuance in March 2005 of $250 million in principal amount Senior Notes I (due March 2015) and our $250 million in principal amount 66 Table of Contents Senior Notes J (due March 2035). In accordance with SFAS No. 6, the principal amount due under Senior Notes A has been reclassified to amounts due after 2009 to match the scheduled maturities of Senior Notes I and J. Joint venture debt obligations We have ownership interests in four joint ventures having long-term debt obligations. The following table shows (i) our ownership interest in each entity at December 31, 2004, (ii) total long-term debt obligations (including current maturities) of each unconsolidated affiliate at December 31, 2004, on a 100% basis to the joint venture and (iii) the corresponding scheduled maturities of such long-term debt (dollars in thousands).

The following is a summary of the significant aspects of the debt obligations of our unconsolidated affiliates. Cameron Highway. In July 2003, Cameron Highway entered into a $325 million project loan facility, consisting of a $225 million construction loan and $100 million of senior secured notes, to finance a substantial portion of the cost to construct the Cameron Highway oil pipeline. The construction loan bears interest at a variable rate. Once the Cameron Highway oil pipeline has commenced operations and transported a certain level of volumes (as specified in the credit agreement), the construction loan will convert to a term loan maturing in July 2008, subject to the terms of the loan agreement. At the end of the first quarter following the first anniversary of the conversion into a term loan, Cameron Highway will be required to make quarterly principal payments of $8.1 million, with the remaining unpaid principal amount payable on the maturity date. If the construction loan fails to convert into a term loan by January 2006, the construction loan and senior secured notes become fully due and payable. At December 31, 2004, Cameron Highway had $197 million outstanding under its construction loan at an average interest rate of 5.48%. The interest rate on Cameron Highway’s senior secured notes is 3.25% over the rate on 10-year U.S. Treasury securities. Principal payments of $4 million are due quarterly from September 2008 through December 2011, $6 million each from March 2012 through December 2012, and $5 million each from March 2013 through the principal maturity date of December 2013. At December 31, 2004, Cameron Highway had $100 million outstanding under its senior secured notes at an average interest rate of 7.36%. The project loan facility as a whole is secured by (1) substantially all of Cameron Highway’s assets, including, upon conversion to a term loan, a debt service reserve capital account, and (2) all of the equity interest in Cameron Highway. Other than the pledge of our equity interest and our construction obligations under the relevant producer agreements, the debt is non-recourse to us. The construction loan and senior secured notes prohibit Cameron Highway from making distributions to us until the construction loan is converted into a term loan and Cameron Highway meets certain financial requirements. Deepwater Gateway. In August 2002, Deepwater Gateway, our unconsolidated affiliate which owns the Marco Polo tension-leg platform, obtained a $155 million project finance loan to finance a substantial portion of the cost to construct the Marco Polo tension-leg platform and related facilities. Construction of the Marco Polo tension-leg platform was completed during the first quarter of 2004, and in June 2004, Deepwater Gateway converted the project finance loan into a term loan which matures in June 2009. The term loan is payable in twenty equal 67 Table of Contents quarterly installments of $5.5 million each (which began on September 30, 2004), and the remaining outstanding principal of $45 million is due on the maturity date. Interest rates are variable and the loan is collateralized by substantially all of Deepwater Gateway’s assets. Deepwater Gateway is required to maintain a debt service reserve of not less than the projected principal, interest and fees due on the term loan for the immediately succeeding six month period. If Deepwater Gateway defaults on its payment obligations under the term loan, we would be required to pay the lenders all distributions we or any of our subsidiaries have received from Deepwater Gateway up to $22.5 million. As of December 31, 2004, the average interest rate charged under this term loan was 4.42%. In accordance with terms of the credit agreement, Deepwater Gateway has the right to repay the principal amount plus any accrued interest due under its term loan at any time without penalty. Deepwater Gateway has decided to extinguish its term loan. We and our 50% joint venture partner in Deepwater Gateway, Cal Dive, will make equal cash contributions to Deepwater Gateway to fund the repayment. At March 9, 2005, the term loan principal amount owed by Deepwater Gateway was $144 million. Poseidon. Poseidon is party to a $170 million revolving credit facility which matures in January 2008. The interest rates Poseidon is charged on balances outstanding under its revolving credit facility are variable and depend on its ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. This credit agreement is secured by substantially all of Poseidon’s assets. As of December 31, 2004, the average interest rate charged under Poseidon’s revolving credit facility was 4.58%. Evangeline. At December 31, 2004, long-term debt for Evangeline consisted of (i) $28.2 million in principal amount of 9.9% fixed-rate Series B senior secured notes that are due in December 2010 and (ii) a $7.5 million subordinated note payable. The Series B senior secured notes are collateralized by Evangeline’s property, plant and equipment; proceeds from a gas sales contract; and by a debt service requirement. Scheduled principal repayments on the Series B notes are $5 million annually through 2009 with a final repayment in 2010 of approximately $3.2 million. The trust indenture governing the Series B notes contains covenants such as requirements to maintain certain financial ratios. Evangeline incurred the subordinated note payable in connection with its acquisition of a contract-based intangible asset in the early 1990s. This note is subject to a subordination agreement which prevents the repayment of principal and accrued interest on the note until such time as the Series B note holders are either fully cash secured through debt service accounts or have been completely repaid. In general, interest accrues on the subordinated note at a variable-rate based on LIBOR plus 1/2%. The variable interest rate paid on this debt at December 31, 2004 was 1.73%. CREDIT RATINGS Our current corporate credit ratings are Baa3 (investment grade) with a stable outlook as rated by Moody’s Investor Services; BB+ (non-investment grade) with a positive outlook as rated by Standard and Poor’s and BBB- (investment grade) with a stable outlook by Fitch ratings. Depending on our future operating results, these credit rating agencies may view our current levels of debt negatively. If one or more of these credit rating agencies were to downgrade our credit standing, we could experience an increase in our borrowing costs, difficulty accessing capital markets or a reduction in the market price of our common units. Such a development could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and to refinance indebtedness. Additionally, if our credit rating by Moody’s declines below Baa3 in combination with our credit rating at Standard & Poor’s remaining at BB+ or below, the $54 million principal balance of our Pascagoula MBFC Loan, and all related accrued and unpaid interest would become immediately due and payable 120 days following such event. If such an event occurred, we would have to redeem the Pascagoula MBFC Loan or provide an alternative credit agreement to support our obligation under the Pascagoula MBFC Loan. 68 Table of Contents CAPITAL SPENDING We have a number of ongoing capital projects, including those we assumed as a result of the GulfTerra Merger (please read “- Significant Announced Growth Capital Projects”). For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our capital spending for business combinations (including non-cash consideration amounts), property, plant and equipment and our unconsolidated affiliates was $3.8 billion, $655.2 million and $1.7 billion, respectively. The following table summarizes our capital spending by activity for the periods indicated: For Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Capital spending for business combinations: GulfTerra Merger (Step Two transactions): Cash payments to El Paso $ 500,000 Transaction fees and other direct costs 24,032 Cash received from GulfTerra (40,313 ) Net cash payments 483,719 Value of non-cash consideration issued or granted 2,910,771 Total GulfTerra Merger Step Two consideration 3,394,490 GulfTerra Merger (Step Three transactions): Cash payments to El Paso 155,277 Mid-America and Seminole pipelines $ 1,182,946 Propylene fractionation and hydrocarbon storage assets 368,636 Other business combinations 85,851 $ 37,348 69,145 Total capital spending related to business combinations 3,635,618 37,348 1,620,727 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment: Growth capital projects 114,419 125,600 64,934 Sustaining capital projects 32,509 20,313 7,201 Total capital spending for property, plant and equipment 146,928 145,913 72,135 Capital spending attributable to unconsolidated affiliates: Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 64,412 471,927 13,651 Total capital spending $ 3,846,958 $ 655,188 $ 1,706,513 The preceding table reflects capital spending of $3.5 billion for the GulfTerra Merger in 2004; $425 million for our investment in GulfTerra GP in 2003; and $1.2 billion for our acquisition of the Mid-America and Seminole pipelines in 2002. Our capital spending for property, plant and equipment is reflected net of contributions in aid of construction of $8.9 million, $0.9 million and $4 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We are committed to the long-term growth and viability of the Company. Part of our business strategy involves expansion through business combinations, growth capital projects and investments in joint ventures. In recent years, major oil and gas companies have sold non-strategic assets in the midstream energy sector in which we operate. We forecast that this trend will continue, and expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestitures. Management continues to analyze potential acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. We believe that we are positioned to continue to grow through acquisitions that will expand our system of assets and through growth capital projects. The combination of our operations with those of GulfTerra provides us with incremental growth opportunities for both onshore and offshore projects. We currently estimate that our capital spending over the next two to three years could approximate up to $2 billion, primarily for growth projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Western regions of North America. Of this amount, we expect to spend approximately $970 million during 2005. The ability to execute our growth strategy and complete our projects is dependent upon our access to the capital necessary to fund projects and acquisitions. Our success with capital raising efforts, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be the critical factor which determines how much we actually spend. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future operating growth needs, and although we currently intend to make the forecasted expenditures discussed below, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures as necessary to adapt to changes in the capital markets. 69 Table of Contents We estimate our forecasted expenditures based upon our strategic operating and growth plans, which are also dependent upon our ability to provide capital from operating cash flows or otherwise obtain the capital necessary to accomplish our operating and growth objectives. These estimates may change due to factors beyond our control, such as weather related issues, changes in supplier prices or poor economic conditions. Further, estimates may change as a result of decisions made at a later date, which may include acquisitions or decisions to take on additional partners. As previously noted, we estimate our capital spending for property, plant and equipment during 2005 to approximate $970 million, which includes estimated expenditures of $900 million for growth capital projects and acquisitions and approximately $70 million for sustaining capital expenditures which result from improvements to and major renewals of existing assets. The following table summarizes our forecasted expenditures during 2005 for announced acquisitions and significant growth capital projects (in millions of dollars): Growth Capital Projects: Independence Hub Platform $ 160.3 Independence Trail Pipeline System 159.8 Constitution Gathering System 126.7 San Juan Optimization Project 30.0 NGL Expansion Projects 29.7 Iso-Octane Conversion Project 12.7 Petal Conversion Project 11.9 Acquisitions: Additional interests in Dixie Pipeline Company (1) 70.9 Indian Springs natural gas gathering and processing assets (1) 74.5 Total $ 676.5 (1) For information regarding these acquisitions, please read “Recent Developments,” included within this Item 7. We also expect to invest approximately $7.5 million in the capital projects of our unconsolidated affiliates during 2005. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $70 million in outstanding purchase commitments related to our share of capital projects, the majority of which pertain to pipeline and platform growth projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Significant Announced Growth Capital Projects Prior to the GulfTerra Merger, GulfTerra had a number of midstream energy projects underway. In addition, we have announced various new growth capital projects that are currently underway. The following is a discussion of our significant growth capital projects, including those acquired with in the GulfTerra Merger: Independence Hub Platform and Independence Trail Pipeline System. In November 2004, we entered into an agreement with the Atwater Valley Producers Group (consisting of Anadarko, Dominion, Kerr-McGee, Spinnaker and Devon) for the dedication, processing and gathering of natural gas and condensate production from several natural gas fields in the Atwater Valley, DeSoto Canyon and Lloyd Ridge areas (collectively, the “anchor fields”) of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We will design, construct, and own Independence Hub, a 105-foot deep-draft, semi-submersible platform with a two-level production deck, which will be capable of processing 850 MMcf/d of natural gas. The platform, which is estimated to cost approximately $385 million, will be operated by Anadarko, and is designed to process production from its anchor fields and has excess payload capacity to support ten additional pipeline risers. In December 2004, we entered into an agreement with Cal Dive to sell them a 20% indirect interest in the Independence Hub platform. Under the terms of the agreement, we will have access to Cal Dive’s fleet of vessels, which will assist us in the construction of the Independence Hub platform and the related export pipeline. Independence Hub platform will be located on Mississippi Canyon Block 920, in a water depth of 8,000 feet. This location was selected for the permanently anchored platform based on favorable seafloor conditions and proximity to the identified anchor fields. First production is expected in 2007. Under the terms of the 70 Table of Contents agreement, the production fields served by the Independence Hub platform will include the dedicated anchor fields in addition to future discoveries on surrounding undeveloped blocks. Additionally, we will construct, own, and operate the 134-mile Independence Trail natural gas pipeline system, which will have a throughput capacity of approximately 850 MMcf/d of natural gas. The pipeline system, which is estimated to cost $280 million, will transport production from the Independence Hub platform to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline. We entered into an agreement with Tennessee Gas Pipeline under which they will pay us $15 million for contributions in aid of construction to connect the Independence Trail natural gas pipeline system to their pipeline system. In November 2004, Tennessee Gas Pipeline reimbursed us $7 million for construction costs incurred. The balance of $8 million would be reimbursed by Tennessee Gas Pipeline when additional costs are incurred and is contingent upon our completion of the Independence Trail project, which is expected during 2006. Constitution Gathering System. In July 2004, GulfTerra entered into a definitive agreement to construct, own, and operate oil and natural gas pipelines to provide production gathering services for the Constitution field, which is 100% owned by Kerr-McGee. The Constitution field is located at a depth of 5,300 feet in Green Canyon Blocks 679 and 680 in the Central Gulf of Mexico. The new $53.4 million natural gas pipeline will be a 32-mile, 16-inch pipeline with a transport capacity of up to 200 MMcf/d and will connect to our existing Anaconda Gathering System. The new $76.2 million oil pipeline will be a 70-mile, 16-inch pipeline with a minimum transport capacity of 80 MBPD that will connect with the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline and Poseidon Oil Pipeline System at our Ship Shoal 332B platform. These pipelines are expected to start transporting volumes in the first half of 2006. San Juan Optimization Project. In May 2003, we commenced a project relating to our San Juan Basin assets. This project, which is estimated to cost approximately $43 million, is expected to be completed in stages through 2006 and will result in increased capacity of up to 130 MMcf/d on our San Juan natural gas gathering system and increased market opportunities through a new interconnect at the tailgate of our Chaco plant. Rocky Mountain NGL pipeline expansion and related NGL fractionation projects. In January 2005, we started a project to expand our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionator to accommodate increased production of NGLs being transported to Mont Belvieu from the Rocky Mountain area. Our Mont Belvieu facility’s current fractionation capacity is up to 210 MBPD of mixed NGLs. This project, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2006 at an estimated total cost of $34.2 million, will increase total fractionation capacity at this facility by 15 MBPD and reduce its energy costs. Additionally, we are reviewing a proposal to construct a new NGL fractionator at our Mont Belvieu complex that could add an additional 60 MBPD of fractionation capacity at this industry hub. Currently, the Rocky Mountain segment of our Mid-America pipeline system transports up to 225 MBPD of NGLs from the major producing basins in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico to the Hobbs station on the Texas-New Mexico border. The Western Expansion Project would increase the capacity of this pipeline to 275 MBPD. Permitting, engineering and design work are in progress. We submitted a draft environmental assessment and plan of development to the appropriate regulatory agencies during the first quarter of 2005. Contingent upon receiving all required permits and regulatory approvals, construction could begin as early as the fourth quarter of 2005. Iso-Octane Conversion Project. As a result of environmental concerns related to MTBE, we are currently in the process of modifying our BEF facility to produce iso-octane, a motor gasoline octane enhancement additive derived from isobutane. We expect iso-octane to be in demand by refiners to replace the amount of octane that is lost as a result of MTBE being eliminated as a motor gasoline blendstock. Depending on the outcome of various factors (including pending federal legislation) the facility may be further modified in the future to produce alkylate. Petal Conversion Project. In the third quarter of 2004, we began to convert an existing brine well at our existing propane storage complex in Hattiesburg, Mississippi to natural gas service. This conversion, which is expected to cost $18 million, will create a new natural gas storage cavern with 1.8 Bcf of working gas capacity that will be integrated with our existing Petal natural gas storage facility. We expect to have the cavern in service during the second quarter of 2005. We have executed long-term storage agreements with BP for the entire capacity of the new natural gas storage cavern. 71 Table of Contents Purchase options associated with retained leases EPCO contributed various equipment leases to us at our formation in 1998 for which EPCO has retained the cash payment obligations (the “retained leases”). EPCO has assigned to us the purchase options associated with the retained leases. During 2003, we exercised our option to purchase an isomerization unit and in October 2004 purchased the unit at a cost of $15 million, which approximated fair value. Additionally, in December 2004, we purchased equipment related to the isomerization unit for $2.8 million pursuant to our purchase option. Should we decide to exercise the remaining purchase options associated with the retained leases (which are also at fair value), an additional $2.3 million would be payable in 2008 and $3.1 million in 2016. Pipeline Integrity Costs Our NGL, petrochemical and natural gas pipelines are subject to pipeline safety programs administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation, through its Office of Pipeline Safety. This federal agency has issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines (which include NGL and petrochemical pipelines) and natural gas pipelines. In general, these regulations require companies to assess the condition of their pipelines in certain high consequence areas (as defined by the regulation) and to perform any necessary repairs. In connection with the new regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines, we developed a pipeline integrity management program in 2002. In connection with the new regulations for natural gas pipelines, we developed a pipeline integrity management program in 2004. During 2004, we spent approximately $22.4 million to comply with these new regulations, of which $12.2 million was recorded as an operating expense of our NGL Pipelines & Services segment and $2.7 million was recorded as an operating expense of our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment. The remaining $7.5 million we spent to comply with the new regulations was capitalized. Based on information currently available, our cash outlays for our pipeline integrity program associated with these new regulations are estimated to be approximately $50.3 million for 2005. The forecasted cost for 2005 is net of an indemnification we will receive from El Paso. In April 2002, GulfTerra acquired several midstream assets located in Texas and New Mexico from El Paso (the “EPN Holdings” acquisition). The assets acquired included the Texas Intrastate System, the Permian Basin System and the Indian Basin gas processing facility. Pursuant to an amended purchase and sale agreement between GulfTerra and El Paso for these assets, El Paso agreed to indemnify GulfTerra against all pipeline integrity costs incurred (whether paid or payable) with respect to the assets acquired in the EPN Holdings acquisition for each of the years ending December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, to the extent that such annual costs exceed $3.3 million; however, the amount reimbursable by El Paso for 2005, 2006 and 2007 shall not exceed $50.2 million. 72 Table of Contents OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Payment or Settlement due by Period Less than 1-3 3-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years (2005) (2006 - 2007) (2008 - 2009) Beyond 2009 Scheduled maturities of long-term debt (1) $ 4,288,698 $ 15,000 $ 500,000 $ 821,000 $ 2,952,698 Estimated cash payments for interest (2) $ 2,666,248 $ 217,925 $ 413,253 $ 370,276 $ 1,664,794 Operating lease obligations (3) $ 88,899 $ 15,012 $ 25,622 $ 14,914 $ 33,351 Purchase obligations: (4) Product purchase commitments: (5) Estimated payment obligations: Natural gas $ 1,160,829 $ 165,120 $ 284,266 $ 284,655 $ 426,788 NGLs $ 174,281 $ 42,664 $ 21,936 $ 21,936 $ 87,745 Petrochemicals $ 1,791,983 $ 1,010,907 $ 774,828 $ 6,248 Other $ 166,706 $ 41,706 $ 62,271 $ 46,845 $ 15,884 Underlying major volume commitments: Natural gas (in BBtus) 149,705 21,855 36,500 36,550 54,800 NGLs (in MBbls) 5,657 1,267 732 732 2,926 Petrochemicals (in MBbls) 27,294 15,559 11,646 89 Service payment commitments (6) $ 7,580 $ 4,906 $ 2,674 Capital expenditure commitment (7) $ 69,288 $ 69,288 Other long-term liabilities, as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet (8) $ 63,521 $ 15,846 $ 10,385 $ 37,290 (1) We have long and short-term payment obligations under credit agreements such as our senior notes and revolving credit facilities. Amounts shown in the table represent our scheduled future maturities of long-term debt principal (including current maturities) for the periods indicated. In accordance with SFAS No. 6, “Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to Be Refinanced,” the scheduled maturities of debt presented in the table reflect (i) our refinancing of Senior Notes A with proceeds from our Senior Notes I and J in March 2005 and (ii) the repayment of our 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility using proceeds from an equity offering completed in February 2005. For additional information regarding our debt obligations, please read “Our liquidity and capital resources – Our debt obligation” included within this Item 7 discussion. (2) Amounts shown in the table above represent our estimated cash interest payments for long-term debt (including current maturities thereof) for the periods indicated. (3) We lease certain property, plant and equipment under noncancelable and cancelable operating leases. Amounts shown in the table represent minimum lease payment obligations under our third-party operating leases with terms in excess of one year for the periods indicated. For addition information regarding our operating lease commitments, please read Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. (4) We define a purchase obligation as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (unconditional) on us that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. (5) We have long and short-term product purchase obligations for NGLs, petrochemicals and natural gas with third-party suppliers. The prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. Amounts shown in the table represent our volume commitments and estimated payment obligations under these contracts for the periods indicated. Our estimated future payment obligations are based on the contractual price under each contract for purchases made at December 31, 2004 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on market prices at the time of delivery. (6) We have long and short-term commitments to pay third-party service providers for services such as maintenance agreements. Our contractual payment obligations vary by contract. The table shows our future payment obligations under these service contracts. (7) We have short-term payment obligations relating to capital projects we have initiated and are also responsible for our share of such obligations associated with the capital projects of our unconsolidated affiliates. These commitments represent unconditional payment obligations that we or our unconsolidated affiliates have agreed to pay vendors for services rendered or products ordered. (8) We have recorded long-term liabilities on our balance sheet reflecting amounts we expect to pay in future periods beyond one year. These liabilities primarily relate to reserves for asset retirement obligations, environmental liabilities and other amounts. Amounts shown in the table represent our best estimate as to the timing of payments based on available information. 73 Table of Contents The operating lease commitments shown in the preceding table exclude the non-cash, related party expense associated with various equipment leases contributed to us by EPCO at our formation for which EPCO has retained the liability (the “retained leases”). The retained leases are accounted for as operating leases by EPCO. EPCO’s minimum future rental payments under these leases are $2.1 million for each of the years 2005 through 2008, $0.7 million for each of the years 2009 through 2015 and $0.3 million for 2016. For additional information regarding the retained leases, please read Item 13 of this annual report on Form 10-K. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities – An Interpretation of ARB No. 51.” This interpretation of ARB No. 51 addresses requirements for accounting consolidation of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) with its primary beneficiary. In general, if an equity owner of a VIE meets certain criteria defined within FIN 46, the assets, liabilities and results of the activities of the VIE should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the owner. Our adoption of FIN 46 (as amended by FIN 46R) in 2003 has had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Due to the complexity of FIN 46 (as amended by FIN 46R and interpreted), the FASB is continuing to provide guidance regarding implementation issues. Since this guidance is still continuing, our conclusions regarding the application of this guidance may be altered. As a result, adjustments may be recorded in future periods as we adopt new FASB interpretations of FIN 46. EITF 03-06, “Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under SFAS No. 128.” This accounting guidance, which is applicable for the period beginning April 1, 2004, requires the two-class method for calculating earnings per share for certain securities that are considered to participate in earnings with common shareholders. Under the two-class method, distributions to equity owners are subtracted from earnings, and any remaining earnings would be allocated to the various classes of owners in proportion to their right to receive distributions as if those earnings had been distributed. The total distributions to each class of owner plus the amount allocated to each class would be used to compute earnings per unit for that class. Since our distributions to owners exceeded earnings during the periods presented, as has historically been the case, the two-class method did not produce any change from the way we have traditionally computed earnings per unit. As a result, our adoption of this standard had no effect on our earnings per unit calculations. SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs — an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” This accounting guidance, which is applicable for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, amends ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. It also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” This accounting guidance, which is applicable for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and supersedes APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” This Statement eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB No. 25, and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. This statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award — the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. Employee share purchase plans will not result in recognition of compensation cost if certain conditions are met; those conditions are much the same as the related conditions in SFAS No. 123. A public entity will initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on its current fair value; the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date. Changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period. 74 Table of Contents The grant-date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments (unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available). If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. We are continuing to evaluate the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and will fully adopt the standard during 2005 within the prescribed time periods. Upon the required effective date, we will apply this statement using a modified version of prospective application as described in the standard. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In our financial reporting process, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following describes the estimation risk underlying our most significant financial statement items: Depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. We use the straight-line method to depreciate the majority of our property, plant and equipment, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the assets. We estimate depreciation based on the estimated useful lives and residual values of our assets. As of the time we place our assets in service, we believe our estimates are accurate. However, circumstances in the future may develop which would cause us to change these estimates and in turn would change our depreciation amounts on a going forward basis. Some of these circumstances include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration and abandonment requirements; changes in expected costs for dismantlement, restoration and abandonment as a result of changes, or expected changes, in labor, materials and other related costs associated with these activities; changes in the useful life of an asset based on the actual known life of similar assets, changes in technology, or other factors; and changes in expected salvage proceeds as a result of a change, or expected change in the salvage market. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was $7.8 billion and $3 billion, respectively. We recorded $161 million and $101 million in depreciation expense during 2004 and 2003, respectively. A significant portion of the year-to-year increase in depreciation expense for 2004 and 2003 is attributable to the property, plant and equipment assets we acquired in the GulfTerra Merger, which were recorded at their preliminary fair values upon completion of the GulfTerra Merger at September 30, 2004. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, please read Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring recoverability of long-lived assets and equity method investments Long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, oil or NGLs. Long-lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through future expected cash flows are written-down to their estimated fair values. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the existing asset. Our estimates of such undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and salvage values. An impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the long-lived asset’s carrying value and its fair value, which is based on a series of assumptions similar to those used to derive undiscounted cash flows but incorporating probabilities that reflect a range of possible outcomes and market value and replacement cost estimates. 75 Table of Contents Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a loss in value of the investment which is an other than temporary decline. Examples of such events or changes include continued operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee’s industry. The carrying value of an equity method investment is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of discounted estimated cash flows expected to be derived from the investment. This estimate of discounted cash flows is based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment. Due to a deteriorating business environment, BEF evaluated the carrying value of its long-lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2003. This review indicated that the carrying value of its long-lived assets exceeded their collective fair value, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $67.5 million. Since BEF was one of our equity investments at that time, our share of this loss was $22.5 million and was recorded as a component of equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates on our 2003 Statement of Consolidated Operations. As a consolidated subsidiary, BEF continues to review its operations on quarterly basis due to the challenging and uncertain business environment in which it operates. In order to complete the GulfTerra Merger, the FTC required us to sell our interest in a Mississippi propane storage facility in which we owned a 50% interest. As a result of our determination of this long-lived asset’s current market value, we recorded a $4 million non-cash asset impairment charge during the third quarter of 2004, which is reflected as a component of operating costs and expenses on our 2004 Statement of Consolidated Operations. Additionally, during 2003 we recorded a $1.2 million asset impairment charge related to our Petal NGL fractionator. This non-cash amount is a component of operating costs and expenses as shown on our 2003 Statement of Consolidated Operations. The Petal NGL fractionation facility was decommissioned in December 2003 after management decided that this older facility did not fit into our long-range plans due to poor economics of continued operations at the site. We continue to own this facility, the carrying value of which has been adjusted to its fair value of approximately $0.1 million. Amortization methods and estimated useful lives of qualifying intangible assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential intangible assets include intellectual property, such as technology, patents, trademarks and trade names, customer contracts and relationships, and non-compete agreements, as well as other intangible assets. The approach to the valuation of each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset, the business in which it is utilized, and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. Our recorded intangible assets primarily include the estimated value assigned to certain customer relationships and contract-based assets. Our customer relationship intangible assets represent the customer base that GulfTerra and the South Texas midstream assets serve through providing services, including natural gas gathering and processing, NGL fractionation and pipeline transportation. These entities conduct the majority of their business through the use of written contracts; thus, the customer relationships represent the rights we own arising from these contractual agreements. The value of these customer relationships are being amortized using expected production curves associated with the underlying resource bases (i.e., the oil and gas reserves associated with the intangible assets). Our estimate of the economic life of each resource base is based on a number of factors, including third-party reserve estimates, the economic viability of production and exploration activities and other industry factors. Our contract-based intangible assets represent the rights we own arising from contractual agreements in the natural gas and NGL storage operations. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of an entity based on the respective contract terms. Our estimate of useful life is also based on a number of factors, including (1) the expected use of the asset by the entity, (2) the expected useful life of the related assets (i.e., fractionation facility, pipeline, etc.), (3) any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions, including renewal or extension periods that would cause substantial costs or modifications to existing agreements, (4) the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors and (5) the level of maintenance required to obtain the expected future cash flows. 76 Table of Contents If our underlying assumptions regarding the useful life or the economic life of the resource base associated with an intangible asset change (either favorably or unfavorably), then we may be required to adjust the amortization period of such asset to reflect any new estimate of its useful life or economic life of the resource base. Such a change would increase or decrease the annual amortization charge associated with the asset at that time. Additionally, if we determine that an intangible asset’s unamortized cost may not be recoverable due to impairment; we may be required to reduce the carrying value and the subsequent useful life of the asset or economic life of the resource base associated with the asset. Any such write-down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life or economic life associated with the resource base (i.e., amortization period) of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was $980.6 million and $268.9 million. We recorded $33.8 million and $14.8 million in amortization expense associated with our intangible assets during 2004 and 2003, respectively. A significant portion of the year-to-year increase in amortization expense for 2004 and 2003 is attributable to the intangible assets we acquired in the GulfTerra Merger, which were recorded at their preliminary fair values upon completion of the GulfTerra Merger at September 30, 2004. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, please read Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Methods we employ to measure the fair value of goodwill Our goodwill is attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and is primarily comprised of $376.8 million associated with the GulfTerra Merger which occurred on September 30, 2004, and $73.7 million associated with the purchase of propylene fractionation assets from Diamond-Koch in February 2002. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level annually, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. The testing of goodwill involves calculating the fair value of a reporting unit, which in turn is based on our assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit (including related goodwill) is less than its book value, a charge to earnings would be required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. If our underlying assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of a reporting unit change, this could further impact the fair value of the reporting unit and result in an additional charge to earnings to reduce the carrying value of goodwill. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying value of our goodwill was $459.2 million and $82.4 million. As a result of the GulfTerra Merger, the preliminary value allocated to goodwill is subject to change. For additional information regarding our goodwill, please read Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our revenue recognition policies and use of estimates for revenues and expenses In general, we recognize revenue from our customers when all of the following criteria are met (i) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. When the contracts settle (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed), a determination of the necessity of an allowance is made and recorded accordingly. Historically, the consolidated revenues we recorded were not materially based on estimates. However, our use of estimates for revenues, as well as our use of estimates for operating costs and other expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations which require us to submit financial information on increasingly accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the timing of compiling actual billing information and receiving third-party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of such use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related information for the subject period). This accrual reverses in the following month and is offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, there is one month of estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and then extrapolated to the end of the month, adjusted accordingly for any known or expected changes in volumes or rates through the end of the 77 Table of Contents month. If the basis of our estimates proves incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. Reserves for environmental matters Each of our business segments is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. These laws and regulations are applicable to each segment and require us to remove or remedy the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of specified substances at current and former operating sites. We currently have a reserve for environmental matters related to remediation costs expected to be incurred over time associated with mercury meters. We assumed this liability in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. New environmental developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and new claims for damages to property, employees, other persons and the environment resulting from current or past operations, could result in substantial cost and future liabilities. We accrue reserves for environmental matters when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments are based on studies, as well as site surveys, to determine the extent of any environmental damage and the necessary requirements to remediate this damage. Our actual results may differ from our estimates, and our estimates can be, and often are, revised in the future, either negatively or positively, depending upon the outcome or expectations based on the facts surrounding each exposure. At December 31, 2004, we had a liability for environmental remediation of $21 million, which was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon studies and site surveys. In accordance with SFAS No. 5 “Accounting for Contingencies” and FASB Interpretation No. 14, “Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss,” we recorded our best estimate of the loss. Natural gas imbalances Natural gas imbalances result when a customer delivers more or less gas into our pipelines than they take out. We generally value our imbalances using a twelve-month moving average of natural gas prices, which we believe is an appropriate assumption to estimate the value of the imbalances at the time of settlement given that the actual settlement dates are generally not known. Changes in natural gas prices may impact our estimates. Prior to the GulfTerra Merger, natural gas imbalances were not significant. At December 31, 2004, our imbalance receivables were $56.7 million and are reflected as a component of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2004, our imbalance payables were $59 million and are reflected as a component of accrued gas payables. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The following information highlights our relationships with EPCO, Shell and our unconsolidated affiliates. For additional information regarding our relationships with these entities, please read Item 13 of this annual report. Relationship with EPCO We have an extensive and ongoing relationship with EPCO. EPCO is controlled by Dan L. Duncan, who is also a director and Chairman of Enterprise GP, our general partner. In addition, the executive and other officers of Enterprise GP are employees of EPCO, including Robert G. Phillips who is Chief Executive Officer and a director of Enterprise GP. For a listing of our directors and executive officers, please read Item 10 of this annual report. Duncan owns 50.4% of the voting stock of EPCO. The remaining shares of EPCO capital stock are held primarily by trusts for the benefit of members of Mr. Duncan’s family. In addition, at December 31, 2004, EPCO and Dan Duncan LLC, together, owned 90.1% of the membership interests of Enterprise GP, which in turn owns a 2% general partner interest in us. In January 2005, an affiliate of EPCO, Enterprise GP Holdings L.P., acquired El Paso’s 9.9% membership interest in Enterprise GP. As a result of this transaction, EPCO and its affiliates own 100% of Enterprise GP. For additional information regarding this subsequent event, please read Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 78 Table of Contents In addition, trust affiliates of EPCO (the 1998 Trust and 2000 Trust), owned 11,387,615 of our common units at March 15, 2005. Collectively, Mr. Duncan, through his beneficial ownership of our common units held personally, by the 1998 and 2000 Trusts and through subsidiaries of EPCO, controlled approximately 37% of our common units at March 15, 2005. For additional information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common units, please read Item 12 of this annual report. The principal business activity of Enterprise GP is to act as our managing partner. We have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to the Administrative and Services Agreement. We reimburse EPCO for the costs associated with employees who work on our behalf. We have entered into an agreement with EPCO to provide trucking services to us for the transportation of NGLs and other products. In addition, we sell NGL products to EPCO’s Canadian affiliate. During 2004, our related party revenues from EPCO were $2.7 million and our related party expenses with EPCO were $230.7 million. Relationship with Shell We have a significant commercial relationship with Shell as a partner, customer and vendor. At March 15, 2005, Shell owned approximately 9.5% of our common units. Shell is one of our largest customers. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, Shell accounted for 6.5%, 5.5% and 7.9%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Our revenues from Shell primarily reflect the sale of NGL and petrochemical products to Shell and the fees we charge Shell for natural gas processing, pipeline transportation and NGL fractionation services. Our operating costs and expenses with Shell primarily reflect the payment of energy-related expenses related to the Shell natural gas processing agreement and the purchase of NGL products from Shell. We also lease from Shell its 45.4% interest in one of our propylene fractionation facilities located in Mont Belvieu. During 2004, our related party revenues from Shell were $542.9 million and our related party expenses with Shell were $725.4 million. The most significant contract affecting our natural gas processing business is the Shell margin-band/keepwhole processing agreement, which grants us the right to process Shell’s current and future production within state and federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico. We have also completed a number of business acquisitions and asset purchases involving Shell since 1999. For additional information regarding our relationship with Shell, please read Item 13 of this annual report. Relationships with unconsolidated affiliates Our investment in unconsolidated affiliates with industry partners is a vital component of our business strategy. These investments are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with a supplier of raw materials or a consumer of finished products. This method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand-alone basis. Many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations. During 2004, related party revenues from our unconsolidated affiliates were $258.5 million and related party expenses with the unconsolidated affiliates were $37.6 million. On occasion, we enter into management agreements with some of our unconsolidated affiliates under which our unconsolidated affiliates pay us management fees for the operation and management of their assets. However, these fees are not material to our consolidated results of operations. Additionally, on occasion we pay for construction costs on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates during the initial construction phase of their assets, and these amounts are settled by direct reimbursements for the amounts we are owed from our unconsolidated affiliates. 79 Table of Contents OTHER ITEMS Non-GAAP reconciliation. A reconciliation of our measurement of total non-GAAP gross operating margin to GAAP operating income and income before provision for income taxes, minority interest and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles (as shown on our Statements of Consolidated Operations and Comprehensive Income included under Item 8 of this annual report) follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Total non-GAAP gross operating margin $ 655,191 $ 410,415 $ 332,349 Adjustments to reconcile total non-GAAP gross operating margin to GAAP operating income: Depreciation and amortization in operating costs and expenses (193,734 ) (115,643 ) (86,028 ) Retained lease expense, net in operating costs and expenses (7,705 ) (9,094 ) (9,125 ) Gain on sale of assets in operating costs and expenses 15,901 16 1 Selling, general and administrative costs (46,659 ) (37,590 ) (42,890 ) GAAP consolidated operating income 422,994 248,104 194,307 Other expense (153,625 ) (134,406 ) (94,226 ) GAAP income before provision for income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 269,369 $ 113,698 $ 100,081 EPCO subleases to us certain equipment located at our Mont Belvieu facility and 100 railcars for $1 per year. These subleases (the “retained lease expense” in the previous table) are part of the Administrative Services Agreement that we executed with EPCO in connection with our formation in 1998. EPCO holds these items pursuant to operating leases for which it has retained the corresponding cash lease payment obligation. Operating costs and expenses (as shown on the Statements of Consolidated Operations and Comprehensive Income included under Item 8 of this annual report) treat the lease payments being made by EPCO as a non-cash related party operating expense, with the offset to Partners’ Equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets recorded as a general contribution to the Company. Apart from the partnership interests we granted to EPCO at our formation, EPCO does not receive any additional ownership rights as a result of its contribution to us of the retained leases. For additional information regarding the EPCO Administrative Services Agreement and the retained leases, please read Item 13 of this annual report. Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. As shown on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2004, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles represents the combined impact of (1) changing the method our BEF subsidiary uses to account for its planned major maintenance activities from the accrue-in-advance method to the expense-as-incurred method and (2) changing the method in which we account for our investment in VESCO from the cost method to the equity method. Our BEF subsidiary owns an octane additive production facility that undergoes periodic planned outages of 30 to 45 days for major maintenance work. These planned shutdowns typically result in significant expenditures, which are principally comprised of amounts paid to third parties for materials, contract services, and other related items. BEF used the accrue-in-advance method to record cost estimates for such activities; whereas, the Company’s other operations used the expense-as-incurred method for their planned major maintenance activities. Our BEF subsidiary changed its accounting method on January 1, 2004 to conform to the Company’s accounting for planned major maintenance costs, which better reflects expenses in the period incurred. As such, we believe the change is to a method that is preferable in the circumstances. The cumulative effect of this accounting change for years prior to 2004 resulted in a benefit of $7 million. EITF 03-16, “Accounting for Investments in Limited Liability Companies,” requires investments in limited liability companies that have separate ownership accounts for each investor be accounted for similar to limited partnerships under SOP No. 78-9, “Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures.” Under this new guidance (applicable for the period beginning July 1, 2004), investors are required to apply the equity method of accounting to 80 Table of Contents their investments at a much lower ownership threshold (typically any ownership interest greater than 3-5%) than the traditional 20% threshold applied under APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” Prior to July 1, 2004, we accounted for our 13.1% investment in VESCO using the cost method. As a result, we recognized dividend income from VESCO to the extent that we received cash distributions from them. In accordance with the new accounting guidance in EITF 03-16, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment equal to the difference between (i) equity earnings from VESCO that would have been recorded using the equity method in periods prior to July 1, 2004 and (ii) the dividend income from VESCO we recorded using the cost method in prior periods. The cumulative effect of this accounting change resulted in a benefit of $3.8 million. For the periods indicated, the following table shows pro forma net income and earnings per unit amounts assuming the accounting changes noted above were applied retroactively to January 1, 2002. See Note 13 for information regarding the effect of the accounting changes on basic and diluted earnings per unit.

If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common units could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Among the key risk factors that may have a direct impact on our results of operations and financial condition are: Risks Related to Our Business Changes in the prices of hydrocarbon products may materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy sector which includes gathering, transporting, processing, fractionating and storing natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. As such, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by changes in the prices of these hydrocarbon products and by changes in the relative price levels among these hydrocarbon products. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbon products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are impossible to control. These factors include: • the level of domestic production; • the availability of imported oil and natural gas; • actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations; • the availability of transportation systems with adequate capacity; • the availability of competitive fuels; • fluctuating and seasonal demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs; and • conservation and the extent of governmental regulation of production and the overall economic environment. We are also exposed to natural gas and NGL commodity price risk under natural gas processing and gathering and NGL fractionation contracts that provide for our fee to be calculated based on a regional natural gas or NGL price index or to be paid in-kind by taking title to natural gas or NGLs. A decrease in natural gas and NGL prices can result in lower margins from these contracts, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. A decline in the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil delivered to our facilities could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our profitability could be materially impacted by a decline in the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil transported, gathered or processed at our facilities. A material decrease in natural gas or crude oil production or crude oil refining, as a result of depressed commodity prices, a decrease in exploration and development activities or otherwise, could result in a decline in the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil handled by our facilities. The crude oil, natural gas and NGLs available to our facilities will be derived from reserves produced from existing wells, which reserves naturally decline over time. To offset this natural decline, our facilities will need access to additional reserves. Additionally, some of our facilities will be dependent on reserves that are expected to be produced from newly discovered properties that are currently being developed. 82 Table of Contents Exploration and development of new oil and natural gas reserves is capital intensive, particularly offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Many economic and business factors are out of our control and can adversely affect the decision by producers to explore for and develop new reserves. These factors include relatively low oil and natural gas prices, cost and availability of equipment, regulatory changes, capital budget limitations or the lack of available capital. For example, a sustained decline in the price of natural gas and crude oil could result in a decrease in natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities in the regions where our facilities are located. This could result in a decrease in volumes to our offshore platforms, natural gas processing plants, natural gas, crude oil and NGL pipelines, and NGL fractionators which would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position. Additional reserves, if discovered, may not be developed in the near future or at all. A reduction in demand for NGL products by the petrochemical, refining or heating industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. A reduction in demand for NGL products by the petrochemical, refining or heating industries, whether because of general economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with NGL products, increased competition from petroleum-based products due to pricing differences, adverse weather conditions, government regulations affecting prices and production levels of natural gas or the content of motor gasoline or other reasons, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For example: Ethane. If natural gas prices increase significantly in relation to ethane prices, it may be more profitable for natural gas producers to leave the ethane in the natural gas stream to be burned as fuel than to extract the ethane from the mixed NGL stream for sale. Propane. The demand for propane as a heating fuel is significantly affected by weather conditions. Unusually warm winters could cause the demand for propane to decline significantly and could cause a significant decline in the volumes of propane that the combined company transports. Isobutane. Any reduction in demand for motor gasoline additives may reduce demand for isobutane. During periods in which the difference in market prices between isobutane and normal butane is low or inventory values are high relative to current prices for normal butane or isobutane, our operating margin from selling isobutane could be reduced. Propylene. Any downturn in the domestic or international economy could cause reduced demand for propylene, which could cause a reduction in the volumes of propylene that we produce and expose our investment in inventories of propane/propylene mix to pricing risk due to requirements for short-term price discounts in the spot or short-term propylene markets. We face competition from third parties in our midstream businesses. Even if reserves exist in the areas accessed by our facilities and are ultimately produced, we may not be chosen by the producers in these areas to gather, transport, process, fractionate, store or otherwise handle the hydrocarbons that are produced. We compete with others, including producers of oil and natural gas, for any such production on the basis of many factors, including geographic proximity to the production; costs of connection; available capacity; rates; and access to markets. Our debt level may limit our future financial and operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $4.3 billion of consolidated debt outstanding. The amount of our debt could have significant effects on our future operations, including, among other things: • a significant portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and will not be available for other purposes, including the payment of distributions on our common units and capital expenditures; • credit rating agencies may view our debt level negatively; 83 Table of Contents • covenants contained in our existing debt arrangements will require us to continue to meet financial tests that may adversely affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business; • our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general partnership purposes may be limited; • we may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to similar companies that have less debt; and • we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions as a result of our significant debt level. Our public debt indentures currently do not limit the amount of future indebtedness that we can create, incur, assume or guarantee. Our multi-year revolving credit facility, however, restricts our ability to incur additional debt, though any debt we may incur in compliance with these restrictions may still be substantial. Our multi-year revolving credit facility and indentures for our public debt contain conventional financial covenants and other restrictions. A breach of any of these restrictions by us could permit the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under those debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and, in the case of the credit facilities, to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Our ability to access capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms will be affected by our debt level, the amount of our debt maturing in the next several years and current maturities, and by adverse market conditions resulting from, among other things, general economic conditions, contingencies and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and impossible to control. Moreover, if the rating agencies were to downgrade our partnership’s credit rating, then we could experience an increase in our borrowing costs, difficulty assessing capital markets or a reduction in the market price of our common units. Such a development could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions or to refinance existing indebtedness. If we are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms in the future, we might be forced to seek extensions for some of our short-term securities or to refinance some of our debt obligations through bank credit, as opposed to long-term public debt securities or equity securities. The price and terms upon which we might receive such extensions or additional bank credit, if at all, could be more onerous than those contained in existing debt agreements. Any such arrangements could, in turn, increase the risk that our leverage may adversely affect our future financial and operating flexibility and thereby impact our ability to pay cash distributions at expected rates. We may not be able to fully execute our growth strategy if we encounter illiquid capital markets or increased competition for qualified assets. Our strategy contemplates growth through the development and acquisition of a wide range of midstream and other energy infrastructure assets while maintaining a strong balance sheet. This strategy includes constructing and acquiring additional assets and businesses to enhance our ability to compete effectively and diversify our asset portfolio, thereby providing more stable cash flow. We regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding, and are currently contemplating, potential joint ventures, stand alone projects or other transactions that we believe will present opportunities to realize synergies, expand our role in the energy infrastructure business and increase our market position. We may require substantial new capital to finance the future development and acquisition of assets and businesses. Limitations on our access to capital will impair our ability to execute this strategy. Expensive capital will limit our ability to develop or acquire accretive assets. We may not be able to raise the necessary funds on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, we are experiencing increased competition for the assets we purchase or contemplate purchasing. Increased competition for a limited pool of assets could result in our losing to other bidders more often or acquiring assets at higher prices. Either occurrence would limit our ability to fully execute our growth strategy. Our inability to execute our growth strategy may materially adversely impact the market price of our securities. 84 Table of Contents Our growth strategy may adversely affect our results of operations if we do not successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire or if we substantially increase our indebtedness and contingent liabilities to make acquisitions. Our growth strategy includes making accretive acquisitions. As a result, from time to time, we will evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing operations. Similar to the risks associated with integrating our operations with GulfTerra’s operations, we may be unable to integrate successfully businesses we acquire in the future. We may incur substantial expenses or encounter delays or other problems in connection with our growth strategy that could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Moreover, acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including: • difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies or business segments; • establishing the internal controls and procedures that we are required to maintain under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002; • managing relationships with new joint venture partners with whom we have not previously partnered; • inefficiencies and complexities that can arise because of unfamiliarity with new assets and the businesses associated with them, including with their markets; and • diversion of the attention of management and other personnel from day-to-day business to the development or acquisition of new businesses and other business opportunities. If consummated, any acquisition or investment would also likely result in the incurrence of indebtedness and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses. As a result, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition. A substantial increase in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our operating cash flows from our capital projects may not be immediate. We are engaged in several construction projects involving existing and new facilities for which significant capital has been expended, and our operating cash flow from a particular project may not increase immediately following its completion. For instance, if we build a new pipeline or platform or expand an existing facility, the design, construction, development and installation may occur over an extended period of time, and we may not receive any material increase in operating cash flow from that project until after it is placed in service. If we experience unanticipated or extended delays in generating operating cash flow from these projects, we may be required to reduce or reprioritize our capital budget, sell non-core assets, access the capital markets or decrease distributions to unitholders in order to meet our capital requirements. Our actual construction, development and acquisition costs could exceed forecasted amounts. We will have significant expenditures for the development, construction or other acquisition of energy infrastructure assets, including some construction and development projects with significant technological challenges. For example, underwater operations, especially those in water depths in excess of 600 feet, are very expensive and involve much more uncertainty and risk, and if a problem occurs, the solution, if one exists, may be very expensive and time consuming. We may not be able to complete our projects, whether in deepwater or otherwise, at the costs estimated at the time of initiation. We may be unable to cause our joint ventures to take or not to take certain actions unless some or all of our joint venture participants agree. We participate in several joint ventures. Due to the nature of some of these joint ventures, each participant in each of these joint ventures has made substantial investments in the joint venture and, accordingly, has required 85 Table of Contents that the relevant organizational documents contain certain features designed to provide each participant with the opportunity to participate in the management of the joint venture and to protect its investment in that joint venture, as well as any other assets which may be substantially dependent on or otherwise affected by the activities of that joint venture. These participation and protective features include a corporate governance structure that requires at least a majority in interest vote to authorize many basic activities and requires a greater voting interest (sometimes up to 100%) to authorize more significant activities. Examples of these more significant activities are large expenditures or contractual commitments, the construction or acquisition of assets, borrowing money or otherwise raising capital, transactions with affiliates of a joint venture participant, litigation and transactions not in the ordinary course of business, among others. Thus, without the concurrence of joint venture participants with enough voting interests, we may be unable to cause any of our joint ventures to take or not to take certain actions, even though those actions may be in the best interest of us or the particular joint venture. Moreover, any joint venture owner may sell, transfer or otherwise modify its ownership interest in a joint venture, whether in a transaction involving third parties or the other joint venture owners. Any such transaction could result in our partnering with different or additional parties. The interruption of distributions to us from our subsidiaries and joint ventures may affect our ability to satisfy our obligations and to make cash distributions to our unitholders. We are a holding company with no business operations. Our only significant assets are the equity interests we own in our subsidiaries and joint ventures. As a result, we depend upon the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the distribution of that cash to us in order to meet our obligations and to allow us to make distributions to our unitholders. In addition, our joint venture charter documents typically vest in its management committee’s sole discretion regarding the occurrence and amount of distributions. Some of the joint ventures in which we participate have several credit agreements that contain various restrictive covenants. Among other things, those covenants may limit or restrict the joint venture’s ability to make distributions to us under certain circumstances. Accordingly, our joint ventures may be unable to make distributions to us at current levels or at all. A natural disaster, catastrophe or other event could result in severe personal injury, property damage and environmental damage, which could curtail our operations and otherwise materially adversely affect our cash flow. Some of our operations involve risks of personal injury, property damage and environmental damage, which could curtail our operations and otherwise materially adversely affect our cash flow. For example, natural gas facilities operate at high pressures, sometimes in excess of 1,100 pounds per square inch. We also operate oil and natural gas facilities located underwater in the Gulf of Mexico, which can involve complexities, such as extreme water pressure. Virtually all of our operations are exposed to potential natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, floods and/or earthquakes. If one or more facilities that are owned by us or that deliver oil, natural gas or other products to us are damaged by severe weather or any other disaster, accident, catastrophe or event, our operations could be significantly interrupted. Similar interruptions could result from damage to production or other facilities that supply our facilities or other stoppages arising from factors beyond our control. These interruptions might involve significant damage to people, property or the environment, and repairs might take from a week or less for a minor incident to six months or more for a major interruption. Additionally, some of the storage contracts that we are a party to obligate us to indemnify our customers for any damage or injury occurring during the period in which the customers’ natural gas is in our possession. Any event that interrupts the fees generated by our energy infrastructure assets, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could reduce our cash available from operating activities and, accordingly, adversely affect the market price of our securities. We believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage, although insurance will not cover many types of interruptions that might occur. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or 86 Table of Contents procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur. An impairment of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings. At December 31, 2004 our balance sheet reflected $459.2 million of goodwill and $980.6 million of intangible assets. Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. GAAP requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets such as intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets were impaired, we would be required to take an immediate charge to earnings with a correlative effect on partners’ equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. Increases in interest rates could adversely affect our business. In addition to our exposure to commodity prices, we have significant exposure to increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $4.3 billion of consolidated debt, of which approximately $2.9 billion was at fixed interest rates and approximately $1.4 billion was at variable interest rates, after giving effect to existing interest swap arrangements. From time to time, we may enter into additional interest rate swap arrangements, which could increase our exposure to variable interest rates. As a result, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates. An increase in interest rates may also cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments in general, and in particular for yield-based equity investments such as our common units. Any such reduction in demand for our common units resulting from other more attractive investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common units to decline. The use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses by us. We historically have sought to limit a portion of the adverse effects resulting from changes in oil and natural gas commodity prices and interest rates by using financial derivative instruments and other hedging mechanisms from time to time. To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we will forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor. In addition, even though monitored by management, hedging activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is imperfect, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed. Our pipeline integrity program may impose significant costs and liabilities on us. In December 2003, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a final rule (effective as of February 14, 2004) requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate their pipelines, and take measures to protect pipeline segments located in what the rule refers to as “high consequence areas.” The final rule resulted from the enactment of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of this rule on us. However, we will continue our pipeline integrity testing programs, which are intended to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. The results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines. 87 Table of Contents Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could materially affect our cash flow. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety, waste management and chemical and petroleum products. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits and to subject violators to civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, injunctions or both. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. We will make expenditures in connection with environmental matters as part of normal capital expenditure programs. However, future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations, permits or enforcement policies, could significantly increase some costs of our operations, including the handling, manufacture, use, emission or disposal of substances and wastes. Moreover, as with other companies engaged in similar or related businesses, our operations have some risk of environmental costs and liabilities because we handle petroleum products. Federal, state or local regulatory measures could materially adversely affect our business. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, regulates our interstate natural gas pipelines and interstate NGL and petrochemical pipelines and interstate natural gas storage facilities, while state regulatory agencies regulate our intrastate natural gas and NGL pipelines, intrastate storage facilities and gathering lines. This federal and state regulation extends to such matters as: • rate structures; • rates of return on equity; • recovery of costs; • the services that our regulated assets are permitted to perform; • the acquisition, construction and disposition of assets; and • to an extent, the level of competition in that regulated industry For a general overview of FERC and state regulation applicable to our energy infrastructure assets, please read “Business and Properties — Regulation and Environmental Matters”, included under Items 1 and 2 of this annual report. This regulatory oversight can affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our products and could materially adversely affect our cash flow. Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority to regulate our natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. Its authority to regulate those services includes the rates charged for the services, terms and conditions of service, certification and construction of new facilities, the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities, the maintenance of accounts and records the initiation, extension and discontinuation of services, and various other matters. FERC requires that our services are provided on a non-discriminatory basis so that all shippers have open access to our pipelines and storage. Pursuant to FERC’s jurisdiction over interstate gas pipeline rates, existing pipeline rates may be challenged by customer complaint or by the FERC Staff and proposed rate increases may be challenged by protest. For example, in December 2002, High Island Offshore System (“HIOS’), an interstate natural gas pipeline owned by us, filed a rate case pursuant to Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act before FERC to increase its transportation fees. FERC accepted HIOS’ tariff sheets implementing the new rates, subject to refund, and set certain issues for hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) The ALJ issued an initial decision on the issues set for hearing on April 22, 2004, proposing rates lower than the rate initially proposed by HIOS. In response to the ALJ’s initial decision, HIOS filed, on August 5, 2004, a settlement agreement whereby HIOS proposed to implement its rates in effect prior to this proceeding for a prospective three-year period. 88 Table of Contents On January 24, 2005, FERC issued an order rejecting HIOS’ settlement offer and generally affirming the ALJ’s initial decision, resulting in rates significantly lower than the rate proposed in HIOS’ settlement offer. On February 24, 2005, we filed a request for rehearing with the FERC. FERC’s January 24 order may be subject to other requests for rehearing and appeal to federal court. We are not able to predict the outcome of the HIOS proceeding, but an adverse outcome in this proceeding or any other rate case proceedings to which we may be a party in the future could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. FERC also has authority under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA, to regulate the rates, terms, and conditions applied to our interstate pipelines engaged in the transportation of NGLs and petrochemicals (commonly known as “oil pipelines”). Pursuant to the ICA, oil pipeline rates can be challenged at FERC either by protest, when they are initially filed or increased, or by complaint at any time they remain on file with the jurisdictional agency. We have interests in natural gas pipeline facilities offshore from Texas and Louisiana. These facilities are subject to regulation by FERC and other federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and by the Department of Transportation’s Office of Pipeline Safety under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act. Our intrastate NGL and natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation in Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas and our intrastate natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC pursuant to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, or NGPA. We also have natural gas underground storage facilities in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Although state regulation is typically less onerous than at FERC, proposed and existing rates subject to state regulation and the provision of services on a non-discriminatory basis are also subject to challenge by protest and complaint, respectively. On July 20, 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued its opinion in BP West Coast Products, LLC v. FERC, addressing the rate of SFPP, a publicly traded limited partnership. The Court a) upheld FERC’s determination that some of SFPP’s rates were grandfathered rates under the Energy Policy Act and that SFPP’s shippers had not demonstrated substantially changed circumstances that would justify modification of those rates, remanded the issue b) eliminated the tax allowance in SFPP’s rates because the SFPP limited partnership did not have tax liability and c) remanded the issue of whether SFPP’s revised cost of service without the tax allowance would qualify as a substantially changed circumstance that would justify modification of SFPP’s rates. Because the court remanded the case to the FERC and because the FERC’s ruling on the substantially changed circumstances issue will focus on the facts and record presented to it, it is not clear what impact, if any, the opinion will have on our rates or on the rates of other FERC-jurisdictional pipelines organized as tax pass-through entities. FERC has initiated a public inquiry in Docket No. PL05-5 into the proper treatment of income tax allowances on cost-of-service ratemaking proceeding involving partnerships. Moreover, it is not clear whether FERC’s action taken in response to BP West Coast will be challenged and, if so, whether it will withstand further FERC or judicial review. Parties could challenge the rates of our common carrier interstate liquid pipelines and our interstate natural gas pipelines and argue that the rationale in the BP West Coast decision, regarding tax allowances, should be applied. While it is possible that party might challenge these rates, it is not possible to predict the likelihood that such a challenge would succeed at the FERC. Terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities could adversely affect our business. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, the United States government has issued warnings that energy assets, including our nation’s pipeline infrastructure, may be the future target of terrorist organizations. Any terrorist attack on our facilities or pipelines or those of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. An escalation of political tensions in the Middle East and elsewhere, could result in increased volatility in the world’s energy markets and result in a material adverse effect on our business. 89 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Common Units as a Result of Our Partnership Structure We may issue additional securities without the approval of our common unitholders. Following the GulfTerra Merger and subject to NYSE rules, we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type (to parties other than our affiliates) without the approval of our unitholders. Our partnership agreement does not give our common unitholders the right to approve its issuance of equity securities ranking equal or junior to the common units. The issuance of additional common units or other equity securities of equal rank will have the following effects: • the proportionate ownership interest of a common unit will decrease; • the amount of cash available for distributions on each unit may decrease; • the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and • the market price of our common units may decline. We may not have sufficient cash from operations to pay distributions at the current level following establishment of cash reserves and payments of fees and expenses, including payments to Enterprise GP. Because distributions on our common units are dependent on the amount of cash we generate, distributions may fluctuate based on our performance. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay distributions at the current level each quarter. The actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend upon numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and the control of Enterprise GP. These factors include but are not limited to the following: • the level of our operating costs; • the level of competition in our business segments; • prevailing economic conditions; • the level of capital expenditures we make; • the restrictions contained in our debt agreements and our debt service requirements; • fluctuations in our working capital needs; • the cost of acquisitions, if any; and • the amount, if any, of cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. In addition, you should be aware that our ability to pay the minimum quarterly distribution each quarter depends primarily on our cash flow, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings, not solely on profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses and we may not make distributions during periods when we record net income. We do not have the same flexibility as other types of organizations to accumulate cash and equity to protect against illiquidity in the future. Unlike a corporation, our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash reduced by any amounts of reserves for commitments and contingencies, including capital and operating costs and debt service requirements. The value of our units and other limited partner interests may decrease in direct correlation with decreases in the amount we distribute per unit. Accordingly, if we experience a liquidity problem in the future, we may not be able to issue more equity to recapitalize. 90 Table of Contents Cost reimbursements and fees due Enterprise GP may be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution to holders of our units. Prior to making any distribution on our units, we will reimburse Enterprise GP and its affiliates, including officers and directors of Enterprise GP, for expenses they incur on our behalf. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to holders of our units. Enterprise GP has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses. In addition, Enterprise GP and its affiliates may provide other services to us for which we will be charged fees as determined by Enterprise GP. Enterprise GP and its affiliates have limited fiduciary responsibilities and conflicts of interest with respect to our partnership. The directors and officers of Enterprise GP and its affiliates have duties to manage Enterprise GP in a manner that is beneficial to its members. At the same time, Enterprise GP has duties to manage our partnership in a manner that is beneficial to us. Therefore, Enterprise GP’s duties to us may conflict with the duties of its officers and directors to its members. Such conflicts may include, among others, the following: • decisions of Enterprise GP regarding the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, cash expenditures, borrowings, issuances of additional units and reserves in any quarter may affect the level of cash available to pay quarterly distributions to unitholders and Enterprise GP; • under our partnership agreement, Enterprise GP determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us; • Enterprise GP is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as its parent company, EPCO, in resolving conflicts of interest, which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to unitholders; • affiliates of Enterprise GP may compete with us in certain circumstances; • Enterprise GP may limit our liability and reduce our fiduciary duties, while also restricting the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that might, without the limitations, constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. As a result of purchasing our units, you are deemed to consent to some actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable law; and • we do not have any employees and we rely solely on employees of EPCO and its affiliates. Even if unitholders are dissatisfied, they cannot easily remove Enterprise GP. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management’s decisions regarding our business. Unitholders did not elect Enterprise GP or its directors and will have no right to elect our general partner or its directors on an annual or other continuing basis. Furthermore, if unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they will have little ability to remove Enterprise GP. Enterprise GP may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of at least 64% of our outstanding units voting together as a single class. Because affiliates of Enterprise GP currently own approximately 37% of our outstanding common units, the removal of Enterprise GP as our general partner is not possible without the consent of both Enterprise GP and such owner affiliates. Unitholders’ voting rights are further restricted by a provision in our partnership agreement stating that any units held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of our units then outstanding, other than our general partner and its affiliates, cannot be voted on any matter. In addition, our partnership agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting our unitholders’ ability to influence the manner or direction of our management. 91 Table of Contents As a result of these provisions, the trading price of our common units may be lower than other forms of equity ownership because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. Enterprise GP has a limited call right that may require common unitholders to sell their units at an undesirable time or price. If at any time Enterprise GP and its affiliates own 85% or more of the common units then outstanding, Enterprise GP will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the remaining common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then current market price. As a result, common unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may therefore not receive any return on their investment. They may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. Under our partnership agreement, Shell is not deemed to be an affiliate of Enterprise GP for purposes of this limited call right. Our common unitholders may not have limited liability if a court finds that limited partner actions constitute control of our business. Under Delaware law, common unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of limited partners to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the “control” of our business. Under Delaware law, our general partner generally has unlimited liability for our obligations, such as our debts and environmental liabilities, except for those of our contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under some circumstances, a limited partner may be liable to us for the amount of a distribution for a period of three years from the date of the distribution. A large number of our outstanding common units may be sold in the market, which may depress the market price of our common units. Sales of a substantial number of our common units in the public market could cause the market price of our common units to decline. As of March 15, 2005, a total of approximately 383,554,318 million of our common units were outstanding. Shell owns 36,572,122 of our common units, representing approximately 9.5% of our outstanding common units at March 15, 2005, and has publicly announced its intention to reduce its holdings of our common units on an orderly schedule over a period of years, taking into account market conditions. Under a registration rights agreement, we are obligated, subject to certain limitations and conditions, to register the common units held by Shell for resale. Sales of a substantial number of these common units in the trading markets, whether in a single transaction or series of transactions, or the possibility that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our outstanding common units. In addition, these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, could make it more difficult for us to sell our common units in the future. 92 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in commodity prices and interest rates. We may use financial instruments (i.e., futures, forwards, swaps, options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics) to mitigate the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions. In general, the type of risks we attempt to hedge are those related to the variability of future earnings, fair values of certain debt instruments and cash flows resulting from changes in applicable interest rates or commodity prices. As a matter of policy, we do not use financial instruments for speculative (or “trading”) purposes. We recognize financial instruments as assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on fair value. Fair value is generally defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, not in a forced or liquidation sale. The estimated fair values of our financial instruments have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques. We must use considerable judgment, however, in interpreting market data and developing these estimates. Accordingly, our fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize upon disposition of these instruments. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation techniques could have a material effect on our estimates of fair value. Changes in the fair value of financial instrument contracts are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the financial instruments meet those criteria, the instrument’s gains and losses offset the related results of the hedged item in earnings for a fair value hedge and are deferred in other comprehensive income for a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses related to a cash flow hedge are reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. To qualify as a hedge, the item to be hedged must be exposed to commodity or interest rate risk and the hedging instrument must reduce the exposure and meet the hedging requirements of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (as amended and interpreted). We must formally designate the financial instrument as a hedge and document and assess the effectiveness of the hedge at inception and on a quarterly basis. Any ineffectiveness of the hedge is recorded in current earnings. Due to the complexity of SFAS No. 133 (as amended and interpreted), the FASB is continuing to provide guidance regarding the implementation of this accounting standard. Since this guidance is still continuing, our conclusions about the application of SFAS No. 133 may be altered, which may result in adjustments being recorded in future periods as we adopt new FASB interpretations of this standard. Interest rate risk hedging program Our interest rate exposure results from variable and fixed rate borrowings under debt agreements. We assess the cash flow risk related to interest rates by identifying and measuring changes in our interest rate exposures that may impact future cash flows and evaluating hedging opportunities to manage these risks. We use analytical techniques to measure our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, including cash flow sensitivity analysis models to forecast the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows. Enterprise GP oversees the strategies associated with these financial risks and approves instruments that are appropriate for our requirements. We manage a portion of our interest rate exposures by utilizing interest rate swaps and similar arrangements, which allow us to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt or a portion of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt. We believe that it is prudent to maintain an appropriate balance of variable rate and fixed rate debt in the current business climate. Fair value hedges – Interest rate swaps. In January 2004, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $250 million in which we exchanged the payment of fixed rate interest on a portion of principal outstanding under Senior Notes B and C for variable rate interest. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we entered into six additional interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $600 million related to a portion of the principal outstanding under Senior Notes G issued on October 4, 2004. 93 Table of Contents Number Period Covered Termination Fixed to Notional Hedged Fixed Rate Debt Of Swaps by Swap Date of Swap Variable Rate (1) Amount Senior Notes B, 7.50% fixed rate, due Feb. 2011 1 Jan. 2004 to Feb. 2011 Feb. 2011 7.50% to 6.3% $50 million Senior Notes C, 6.375% fixed rate, due Feb. 2013 2 Jan. 2004 to Feb. 2013 Feb. 2013 6.375% to 4.9% $200 million Senior Notes G, 5.6% fixed rate, due Oct. 2014 6 4th Qtr. 2004 to Oct. 2014 Oct. 2014 5.6% to 3.4% $600 million (1) The variable rate indicated is the all-in variable rate for the current settlement period. We have designated these nine interest rate swaps as fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133 since they mitigate changes in the fair value of the underlying fixed rate debt. As effective fair value hedges, an increase in the fair value of these interest rate swaps is equally offset by an increase in fair value of the underlying hedged debt. The offsetting changes in fair value have no effect on current period interest expense. These nine agreements have a combined notional amount of $850 million and match the maturity dates of the underlying debt being hedged. Under each swap agreement, we pay the counterparty a variable interest rate based on six-month LIBOR rates (plus an applicable margin as defined in each swap agreement) and receive back from the counterparty a fixed interest rate payment based on the stated interest rate of the debt being hedged, with both payments calculated using the notional amounts stated in each swap agreement. We settle amounts receivable from or payable to the counterparties every six months (the “settlement period”). The settlement amount is amortized ratably to earnings as either an increase or a decrease in interest expense over the settlement period. Total fair value of the interest rate swaps in effect at December 31, 2004 was a receivable of approximately $0.5 million with an offsetting increase in fair value of the underlying debt. Interest expense in our Statements of Consolidated Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflects a $9.1 million benefit from these swap agreements. The following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value (“FV”) of our interest rate swap portfolio and the related change in fair value of the underlying debt at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands): Resulting Swap FV Inc (Dec) in Scenario Classification at 12/31/04 FV of Debt FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) $ 505 $ (505 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) (31,586 ) 32,091 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) 32,596 (32,091 ) Resulting Swap FV Inc (Dec) in Scenario Classification at 03/02/05 FV of Debt FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) $ (10,066 ) $ 10,066 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) (42,028 ) 31,963 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) 21,897 (31,963 ) The fair value of the interest rate swaps excludes the benefit we have already recorded in earnings. The change in fair value between December 31, 2004 and March 2, 2005 is primarily due to an increase in market interest rates relative to the forward interest rate curve used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. The underlying floating LIBOR forward interest rate curve used to determine the March 2, 2005 fair values ranged from approximately 2.2% to 5.5% using 6-month reset periods ranging from October 2004 to October 2014. Cash flow hedges – Forward starting interest rate swaps. During the first nine months of 2004, we entered into eight forward starting interest rate swap transactions having an aggregate notional amount of $2 billion in anticipation of our financing activities associated with closing the GulfTerra Merger. Our purpose in entering into these transactions was to effectively hedge the underlying U.S. treasury rate related to our anticipated issuance of $2 billion in principal amount of fixed rate debt. On October 4, 2004, our Operating Partnership issued $2 billion of private debt securities under Senior Notes E, F, G and H. Each of the forward starting swaps was designated as a cash flow hedge under SFAS No. 133. 94 Table of Contents In April 2004, we elected to terminate the initial four forward starting swaps in order to manage and maximize the value of the swaps and to reduce future debt service costs. As a result, we received $104.5 million in cash from the counterparties. In September 2004, we settled the remaining four swaps resulting in an $85.1 million payment to the counterparties. The net gain of $19.4 million from these settlements will be reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income to reduce interest expense over the life of the associated debt. The following table shows the notional amount covered by each forward starting swap and the cash gain (loss) associated with each swap upon settlement (dollars in thousands): Notional Net Cash Amount of Received upon Debt covered by Settlement of Term of Anticipated Debt Offering Forward Forward (or Forecasted Transaction) Starting Swaps Starting Swaps 3-year, fixed rate debt instrument $ 500,000 $ 4,613 5-year, fixed rate debt instrument 500,000 7,213 10-year, fixed rate debt instrument 650,000 10,677 30-year, fixed rate debt instrument 350,000 (3,098 ) Total $ 2,000,000 $ 19,405 Commodity risk hedging program The prices of natural gas, NGLs and petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage the risks associated with natural gas and NGLs, we may enter into commodity financial instruments. The primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to price risks associated with (i) natural gas purchases, (ii) NGL production and inventories, (iii) related firm commitments, (iv) fluctuations in transportation revenues where the underlying fees are based on natural gas index prices and (v) certain anticipated transactions involving either natural gas or NGLs. The commodity financial instruments we utilize may be settled in cash or with another financial instrument. Historically, we have not hedged our exposure to risks associated with petrochemical products, including MTBE. We have adopted a policy to govern our use of commodity financial instruments to manage the risks of our natural gas and NGL businesses. The objective of this policy is to assist us in achieving our profitability goals while maintaining a portfolio with an acceptable level of risk, defined as remaining within the position limits established by Enterprise GP. We may enter into risk management transactions to manage price risk, basis risk, physical risk or other risks related to our commodity positions on both a short-term (less than 30 days) and long-term basis, not to exceed 24 months. Enterprise GP oversees the strategies associated with physical and financial risks (such as those mentioned previously), approves specific activities subject to the policy (including authorized products, instruments and markets) and establishes specific guidelines and procedures for implementing and ensuring compliance with the policy. We assess the risk of our commodity financial instrument portfolio using a sensitivity analysis model. The sensitivity analysis performed on this portfolio measures the potential income or loss (e.g., the change in fair value of the portfolio) based upon a hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying quoted market prices of the commodity financial instruments outstanding at the dates noted within the following table. In general, the quoted market prices used in the model are from those actively quoted on commodity exchanges (i.e., NYMEX) for instruments of similar duration. In those rare instances where prices are not actively quoted, we calculate forward price curves based on similar products which are actively quoted using regression equations with strong correlation factors. The sensitivity analysis model takes into account the following primary factors and assumptions: • the current quoted market price of natural gas; • the current quoted market price of NGLs; 95 Table of Contents • changes in the composition of commodities hedged (i.e., the mix between natural gas and related NGLs); • fluctuations in the overall volume of commodities hedged (for both natural gas and related NGL hedges outstanding); • market interest rates, which are used in determining the present value; and • a liquid market for such financial instruments. An increase in fair value of the commodity financial instruments (based upon the factors and assumptions noted above) approximates the income that would be recognized if all of the commodity financial instruments were settled at the dates noted within the table. Conversely, a decrease in fair value of the commodity financial instruments would result in the recording of a loss. The sensitivity analysis model does not include the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged commodity positions to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of the commodity financial instruments of a change in commodity prices would be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged commodity positions, assuming: • the commodity financial instruments function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk; • the commodity financial instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term; and • as applicable, anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected. We routinely review our outstanding financial instruments in light of current market conditions. If market conditions warrant, some financial instruments may be closed out in advance of their contractual settlement dates thus realizing income or loss depending on the specific exposure. When this occurs, we may enter into a new commodity financial instrument to reestablish the economic hedge to which the closed instrument relates. We had a limited number of commodity financial instruments in our portfolio at December 31, 2004. The following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value (“FV”) of this portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands): Resulting FV FV FV Scenario Classification at 12/31/03 at 12/31/04 at 3/02/05 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ 4 $ 219 $ (256 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 4 47 (703 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 4 391 191 At December 31, 2004, our portfolio primarily consisted of a limited number of natural gas cash flow and fair value hedges. We recorded $0.4 million of income related to our commodity hedging activities during 2004 and an expense of $0.6 million during 2003 that are included in our operating costs and expenses in the Statements of Consolidated Operations and Comprehensive Income. During 2002, we recognized a loss of $51.3 million from our commodity hedging activities that was recorded as an increase in our operating costs and expenses. Beginning in late 2000 and extending through March 2002, a large number of our commodity hedging transactions were based on the historical relationship between natural gas and NGL prices. This type of hedging strategy utilized the forward sale of natural gas at a fixed price with the expected margin on the settlement of the position offsetting or mitigating changes in the anticipated margins on NGL marketing activities and the market values of our equity NGL production. Throughout 2001, this strategy proved very successful (as the price of natural gas declined relative to our fixed positions) and was responsible for most of the $101.3 million in commodity hedging income we recorded during 2001. 96 Table of Contents In late March 2002, the effectiveness of this strategy was reduced due to an unexpected rapid increase in natural gas prices whereby the loss in the value of our fixed-price natural gas financial instruments was not offset by increased natural gas processing margins. Due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding natural gas prices at the time, we decided that it was prudent to exit this strategy, and we did so by late April 2002. The increased ineffectiveness of this strategy is the primary reason for the $51.3 million in commodity hedging losses recorded during 2002. Product purchase commitments. We have long and short-term purchase commitments for NGLs, petrochemicals and natural gas with several suppliers. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. For additional information regarding these commitments, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Contractual Obligations” included under Item 7 of this annual report. Effect of financial instruments on Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The following table summarizes the effect of our cash flow hedging financial instruments on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) since January 1, 2002.

In addition, in the first quarter of 2005, we will record an approximate $1.6 million gain into income from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income related to a commodity cash flow hedge acquired in the GulfTerra Merger. This gain is primarily due to an increase in fair value from that recorded for the commodity cash flow hedge at December 31, 2004.",2023-12-30 21:16:54.797002
1061219,EPD,ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS PARTNERS L.P.,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. is a North American midstream energy company that provides a wide range of services to producers and consumers of natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”), and crude oil, and is an industry leader in the development of pipeline and other midstream assets in the continental United States and Gulf of Mexico. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Enterprise Products Partners” are intended to mean the consolidated business and operations of Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and its subsidiaries. We conduct substantially all of our business through our wholly owned subsidiary, Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (our “Operating Partnership”). We are owned 98% by our limited partners and 2% by Enterprise Products GP, LLC (our general partner, referred to as “Enterprise Products GP”). Enterprise Products GP is owned 100% by Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. (“Enterprise GP Holdings”), a publicly traded affiliate listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPE.” We, Enterprise Products GP and Enterprise GP Holdings are affiliates and under common control of Dan L. Duncan, the Chairman and the controlling shareholder of EPCO, Inc. (“EPCO”). This annual report contains various forward-looking statements and information based on our beliefs and those of Enterprise Products GP, as well as assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. Please read the section titled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information” included under Item 1 of this annual report. As generally used in the energy industry and in this document, the identified terms have the following meanings: / d = per day BBtus = billion British Thermal units Bcf = billion cubic feet MBPD = thousand barrels per day Mdth = thousand dekatherms MMBbls = million barrels MMBtus = million British thermal units MMcf = million cubic feet Mcf = thousand cubic feet RECENT DEVELOPMENTS The year 2005 was a challenging year for Enterprise Products Partners. The Gulf Coast region experienced two major hurricanes (Katrina and Rita) that affected our employees, suppliers, customers and industry. Our thoughts remain with those displaced by these storms and we are well-positioned to assist the Gulf Coast energy industry in the rebuilding effort. Although certain of our facilities incurred structural damage as a result of the storms and other operations were interrupted, by year-end the majority of our operated facilities were at pre-hurricane production, transportation or processing levels. In particular, our Toca natural gas processing facility, which is located in coastal Louisiana and was heavily damaged in Hurricane Katrina, has recently returned to operations. For information regarding our insurance claims related to these storms, please read Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our growth capital spending for 2005 was a record of $743.8 million, which includes $338.6 million for our Independence Hub offshore platform and related Independence Trail Pipeline and $90.1 million for our Constitution Oil and Constitution Gas Pipelines. In addition, we recently announced two new natural gas processing projects in the Rockies. We expect that these projects will enhance our existing asset base and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future. In addition to our growth capital projects, we completed $326.6 million in acquisitions during 2005, the largest of which was the $145.5 million purchase of underground NGL storage facilities and propane terminals from Ferrellgas L.P. 43 Table of Contents (“Ferrellgas”). For additional information regarding our growth capital spending and acquisitions, please read “Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. During 2005, we completed the integration of our legacy operations with those of GulfTerra Energy Partners L.P. (“GulfTerra”). In September 2004, we completed the “GulfTerra Merger” transaction, whereby GulfTerra merged with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result of the GulfTerra Merger, GulfTerra and its subsidiaries and GulfTerra’s general partner (“GulfTerra GP”) became our wholly owned subsidiaries. The GulfTerra Merger greatly expanded our asset base to include numerous natural gas and crude oil pipelines, offshore platforms and other midstream energy assets. Additionally, the GulfTerra Merger included the purchase of various midstream assets from El Paso that are located in South Texas. For additional information regarding the GulfTerra Merger, please read Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline began deliveries of Gulf of Mexico crude oil production during the first quarter of 2005 to major refining markets along the Texas Gulf Coast. The Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline can transport up to 500 MBPD of deepwater Gulf of Mexico crude oil production. We own a 50% interest in this system through our equity method investment in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (“Cameron Highway”). We completed construction of the Constitution Oil and Constitution Gas Pipelines in 2005. We own and operate these pipelines, which provide production gathering services for the Constitution and Ticonderoga fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Initial throughput is expected on the Constitution pipelines during the first quarter of 2006. In May 2003, GulfTerra commenced a project relating to its San Juan Basin assets. The San Juan Optimization Project was substantially complete in 2005 at an approximate cost of $31 million. This project resulted in a 10% increase of capacity on our San Juan Gathering System and will increase market opportunities through a new interconnect with the Transwestern Pipeline. We connected a record 336 natural gas wells to the San Juan Gathering System during 2005. In February 2005, we sold 17,250,000 common units (including an over-allotment amount of 2,250,000 common units which closed in March 2005), which generated net proceeds of approximately $456.7 million. In addition, our Operating Partnership sold $500 million of senior notes in February 2005. In March 2005, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the issuance of up to $4 billion of additional partnership equity and/or public debt obligations. In June 2005, our Operating Partnership sold $500 million of senior notes under this registration statement. In December 2005, we sold 4,000,000 common units under this registration statement, which generated net proceeds of $98.7 million. For additional information regarding our debt obligations and capital structure, please see Notes 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. In October 2005, our Operating Partnership amended its revolving credit facility to increase total bank commitments from $750 million to $1.25 billion (which may be further increased to $1.4 billion upon our request, subject to certain conditions). The increase in borrowing capacity under our Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility further enables us to meet future funding requirements of our growth capital projects. For additional information regarding our debt obligations, please see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. The ownership of our general partner underwent a number of changes during 2005. In January 2005, affiliates of EPCO acquired a 9.9% membership interest in Enterprise Products GP and 13,454,498 of our common units from El Paso for approximately $425 million in cash. As a result of these transactions, EPCO and its affiliates owned 100% of the membership interests of Enterprise Products GP. In August 2005, EPCO and its affiliates contributed their membership interests in Enterprise Products GP to Enterprise GP Holdings. Affiliates of EPCO currently own 86.5% of Enterprise GP Holdings. For additional information regarding these transactions between related parties, please read Item 13 of this annual report. 44 Table of Contents CAPITAL SPENDING We are committed to the long-term growth and viability of Enterprise Products Partners. Part of our business strategy involves expansion through business combinations, growth capital projects and investments in joint ventures. In recent years, major oil and gas companies have sold non-strategic assets in the midstream energy sector in which we operate. We forecast that this trend will continue, and expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestitures. Management continues to analyze potential acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. We believe that we are positioned to continue to grow through construction of new facilities and acquisitions that will expand our system of assets and through growth capital projects. We estimate our consolidated capital spending during 2006 will approximate $1.8 billion, which includes estimated expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion for growth capital projects and acquisitions and approximately $78 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our forecast of consolidated capital expenditures is based upon our strategic operating and growth plans, which are also dependent upon our ability to generate capital from operating cash flows or otherwise obtain the capital necessary to accomplish our objectives. Our forecast may change due to factors beyond our control, such as weather related issues, changes in supplier prices or adverse economic conditions. Further, our forecast may change as a result of decisions made at a later date, which may include acquisitions or decisions to take on additional partners. Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be the principal factor that determines how much we can spend. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future operating growth needs, and although we currently intend to make the forecasted expenditures discussed above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital markets. 45 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our capital spending by activity for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): For Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Capital spending for business combinations and asset purchases: GulfTerra Merger: Cash payments to El Paso, including amounts paid to acquire certain South Texas midstream assets $ 655,277 Transaction fees and other direct costs 24,032 Cash received from GulfTerra (40,313 ) Net cash payments 638,996 Value of non-cash consideration issued or granted 2,910,771 Total GulfTerra Merger consideration 3,549,767 Indirect interests in the Indian Springs natural gas gathering and processing assets $ 74,854 Additional ownership interests in Dixie Pipeline Company (“Dixie”) 68,608 NGL underground storage and terminalling assets purchased from Ferrellgas 145,522 Other business combinations and asset purchases 37,618 85,851 $ 37,348 Total 326,602 3,635,618 37,348 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment: Growth capital projects, net 743,827 114,419 125,600 Sustaining capital projects 73,622 32,509 20,313 Total 817,449 146,928 145,913 Capital spending attributable to unconsolidated affiliates: Purchase of 50% interest in GulfTerra GP in connection with the initial step of the GulfTerra Merger 425,000 Other investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 88,044 64,412 46,927 Total 88,044 64,412 471,927 Total capital spending $ 1,232,095 $ 3,846,958 $ 655,188 As shown in the preceding table, capital spending for growth capital projects is presented net of contributions in aid of construction costs of $47 million, $8.9 million and $0.9 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. On certain of our capital projects, third parties may be obligated to reimburse us for all or a portion of project expenditures. The majority of such arrangements are associated with projects related to pipeline construction and production well tie-ins. Our significant capital spending transactions during 2005 include the following: § We paid El Paso $74.9 million for indirect majority ownership interests in the 89-mile Indian Springs Gathering System and the Indian Springs natural gas processing facility, both of which are located in East Texas. § We paid $68.6 million for an additional 46% interest in Dixie from affiliates of ConocoPhillips and ChevronTexaco. As a result of these acquisitions, Dixie is now a majority-owned consolidated subsidiary of ours. § We purchased three NGL underground storage facilities and four propane terminals from Ferrellgas for $145.5 million in cash. The underground storage facilities are located in Kansas, Arizona and Utah and have a combined capacity of 6.1 MMBbls. Approximately 70% of the aggregate storage capacity is leased to third party customers under fee-based contracts. The four propane terminals are located in Minnesota and North Carolina. The Minnesota facilities are connected to our Mid-America Pipeline System, and the North Carolina terminals are connected by rail to our facilities on the Gulf Coast. As part of the transaction, Ferrellgas has contracted with us to maintain a certain level of storage volume and terminal throughput for five years with the option to extend for an additional five years. 46 Table of Contents Significant Recently Announced Growth Capital Projects Jonah Expansion. In February 2006, we and TEPPCO Partners, L.P. (“TEPPCO”), affiliate of EPCO, entered into a letter of intent related to the formation of a joint venture to expand TEPPCO’s Jonah Gas Gathering System (“the Jonah system”), located in the Green River Basin in southwestern Wyoming. The proposed expansion of the Jonah system would increase the natural gas gathering and transportation capacity of the Jonah system from 1.5 Bcf/d to 2.0 Bcf/d. The letter of intent stipulates that we will be responsible for all activities related to the construction of the expansion of the Jonah system, including advancing of all expenditures necessary to plan, engineer and construct the expansion project. We estimate that total funds needed for this project will approximate $200 million and that the expansion assets will be placed in service in late 2006. The amounts we advance to complete the expansion of the Jonah system will constitute a subscription for an equity interest in the proposed joint venture. TEPPCO has the option to return to us up to 100% of the amounts we advance (i.e., the subscription amounts). If TEPPCO returns any portion of the subscription to us, the relative interests of us and TEPPCO in the new joint venture would be adjusted accordingly. The proposed joint venture arrangement will terminate without liability to either party if TEPPCO returns 100% of the advances we make in connection with the expansion project, including carrying costs and expenses. The general partner of TEPPCO and 2,500,000 common units of TEPPCO are owned by an affiliate of Mr. Duncan, Chairman of the board of directors of our general partner. Piceance Basin Gas Processing Project. In January 2006, we announced the execution of a minimum 15-year natural gas processing agreement with an affiliate of the EnCana Corporation (“EnCana”). Under that agreement, we will have the right to process up to 1.3 Bcf/d of EnCana’s natural gas production from the Piceance Basin area of western Colorado. To accommodate this production, we have begun construction of the Meeker natural gas processing facility in Rio Blanco County, Colorado. In addition, we will construct a 50-mile NGL pipeline that will connect our Meeker facility with our Mid-America Pipeline System. Phase I, which includes construction of the plant and pipeline, will provide us with 750 MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and the ability to recover up to 35 MBPD of NGLs. Phase II, which includes the expansion of the plant, will expand natural gas processing capacity at the facility to 1.3 Bcf/d and increase NGL extraction rates to up to 70 MBPD. We expect Phase I and Phase II to be operational by mid-2007 and late-2008, respectively. Phase I is expected to cost $284 million. Wyoming Gas Processing Projects. In January 2006, we announced our intent to purchase from TEPPCO the Pioneer natural gas processing plant located in Opal, Wyoming and the rights to process natural gas originating from the Jonah and Pinedale fields in the Greater Green River Basin in Wyoming. Upon execution of definitive agreements, the receipt of all necessary regulatory approval and approvals from the boards of directors of TEPPCO and our general partner, we would purchase the Pioneer plant for $36 million and commence construction to increase its processing capacity from 275 MMcf/d to 550 MMcf/d at an additional expected cost of $21 million. We expect this expansion to be completed in mid-2006. We have also announced our intent to build a new gas processing plant with a capacity of 650 MMcf/d adjacent to the Pioneer plant. We expect to place the new facility in service during 2007. The Pioneer expansion and the new natural gas processing plant will serve growing natural gas production in the Jonah and Pinedale fields. The cost of this new processing facility is expected to be $228 million. Natural Gas Storage Expansion. In December 2005, we completed the conversion of an existing brine well located at our Petal, Mississippi storage facility to a 2.4 Bcf natural gas storage cavern at a cost of $15 million. Due to strong demand for natural gas storage, we have commenced the development of an additional storage cavern at the Petal facility that is expected to add 5 Bcf of storage capacity. This cavern is expected to cost $75 million and be placed in service during the first quarter of 2008. 47 Table of Contents Expansion of Mont Belvieu NGL and Petrochemical Storage Services. In November 2005, we announced an expansion of our NGL and petrochemical storage services at our complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas to improve our ability to receive and deliver NGLs and petrochemicals. The Mont Belvieu expansion projects include the drilling of two new brine production wells and the construction of two above-ground brine storage pits. The increased brine storage capability will further enable us to enhance product storage services and movement to transportation and distribution pipelines that serve the Gulf Coast region, as well as our import and export facilities on the Houston Ship Channel. As a result of these projects, we will also more than double our above-ground brine storage capabilities to 19 MMBbls and will increase our capacity to produce brine. These projects are expected to be placed in service in 2006 and 2007 and are expected to cost $77 million. Hobbs NGL Fractionator. In June 2005, we announced plans to construct a new NGL fractionator, designed to handle up to 75 MBPD of mixed NGLs, located at the interconnection of our Mid-America Pipeline System and our Seminole Pipeline near Hobbs, New Mexico. Additionally, we will construct a purity ethane storage well near the new fractionator and reconfigure the interconnection between our Mid-America Pipeline System and the Seminole Pipeline. These projects are expected to cost $175 million and be placed in service by mid-2007. Our Hobbs NGL fractionator will process the increase in mixed NGLs resulting from our Phase I expansion of the Mid-America Pipeline System. Mid-America Pipeline System Phase I Expansion. In January 2005, we announced an expansion of the Rocky Mountain segment of our Mid-America Pipeline System to accommodate an expected increase in mixed NGLs originating from producing basins in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico. The expansion project will be completed in stages and will increase throughput volumes on the segment by a total of 50 MBPD. We expect final completion of the Phase I expansion during the second quarter of 2007 at a cost of $187 million. We expect to receive the necessary regulatory approval and begin construction on our Phase I expansion project in the first quarter of 2006. Expansion of Mont Belvieu NGL Fractionator. In January 2005, we began a project to expand the processing capacity of our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionator from 210 MBPD to 225 MBPD and to reduce energy costs. This expansion project will enable us to accommodate a portion of an expected increase in NGL production from the Rocky Mountains. The project is expected to cost approximately $41 million and be completed in mid-2006. Independence Hub Platform and Independence Trail Pipeline System. In November 2004, we entered into an agreement with the Atwater Valley Producers Group for the dedication, processing and gathering of natural gas and condensate production from several natural gas fields in the Atwater Valley, DeSoto Canyon, Lloyd Ridge and Mississippi Canyon areas (collectively, the “anchor fields”) of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. First production is expected in 2007. We are constructing and will own the Independence Hub platform, which will be located in Mississippi Canyon Block 920, at a water depth of 8,000 feet. The Independence Hub is a 105-foot deep-draft, semi-submersible platform with a two-level production deck, which will process 1 Bcf/d of natural gas. The platform, which is estimated to cost $420 million, will be operated by Anadarko, and is designed to process production from its anchor fields and has excess payload capacity to support ten additional pipeline risers. In December 2004, we entered into an agreement with Cal Dive International Inc. (“Cal Dive”) to sell them a 20% indirect interest in the Independence Hub platform. Additionally, we will construct, own, and operate the 134-mile Independence Trail natural gas pipeline system, which will have a throughput capacity of 1 Bcf/d of natural gas. The pipeline system, which is estimated to cost $268 million, will transport production from the Independence Hub platform to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline. Pipeline Integrity Costs Our NGL, petrochemical and natural gas pipelines are subject to pipeline safety programs administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation, through its Office of Pipeline Safety. This federal 48 Table of Contents agency has issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines (which include NGL and petrochemical pipelines) and natural gas pipelines. In general, these regulations require companies to assess the condition of their pipelines in certain high consequence areas (as defined by the regulation) and to perform any necessary repairs. In connection with the regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines, we developed a pipeline integrity management program in 2002. In connection with the regulations for natural gas pipelines, we developed a pipeline integrity management program in 2004. During 2005, we spent approximately $42.2 million to comply with these programs, of which $25 million was recorded as an operating expense, and the remaining $17.2 million was capitalized. We spent approximately $22.4 million to comply with these programs during 2004, of which $14.9 million was recorded as an operating expense and the remaining $7.5 million was capitalized. We expect our net cash outlay for pipeline integrity program expenditures to approximate $63.2 million during 2006. Our forecast is net of certain costs we expect to recover from El Paso. In April 2002, GulfTerra acquired several midstream assets located in Texas and New Mexico from El Paso. These assets include the Texas Intrastate System and the Permian Basin System. El Paso agreed to indemnify GulfTerra for any pipeline integrity costs it incurred (whether paid or payable) during 2005, 2006 and 2007 with respect to such assets, to the extent that such annual costs exceed $3.3 million; however, the aggregate amount reimbursable by El Paso for these periods is capped at $50.2 million. During 2006, we expect to recover $13.8 million from El Paso related to our 2005 expenditures, which leaves a remainder of $36.4 million reimbursable by El Paso for 2006 and 2007 pipeline integrity costs. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We have four reportable business segments: NGL Pipelines & Services, Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, Offshore Pipelines & Services and Petrochemical Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the type of services rendered (or technology employed) and products produced and/or sold. We evaluate segment performance based on the non-generally accepted accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The financial measure calculated using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. Our non-GAAP financial measure of total segment gross operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP operating income. We define total (or consolidated) segment gross operating margin as operating income before: (i) depreciation and amortization expense; (ii) operating lease expenses for which we do not have the payment obligation; (iii) gains and losses on the sale of assets; and (iv) general and administrative expenses. Gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, provision for income taxes, minority interest, extraordinary charges and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses (net of the adjustments noted above) from segment revenues, with both segment totals before the elimination of intersegment and intrasegment transactions. For additional information regarding our business segments, please read Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. We have historically included equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin and operating income. Our equity investments with industry partners are a vital component of our business strategy. They are a means by which we conduct our operations to 49 Table of Contents align our interests with those of our customers, which may be suppliers of raw materials or consumers of finished products. This method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand-alone basis. Many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations. Our integrated midstream energy asset system (including the midstream energy assets of our equity method investees) provides services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs and petrochemicals. Our asset system has multiple entry points. In general, hydrocarbons can enter our asset system in a number of ways, including an offshore natural gas or crude oil pipeline, an offshore platform, a natural gas processing plant, an NGL gathering pipeline, an NGL fractionator, an NGL storage facility, an NGL transportation or distribution pipeline or an onshore natural gas pipeline. At each link along this asset system, we earn revenues based on volume or an ownership of products such as NGLs. Many of our equity investments are present within our integrated midstream asset system. For example, we have ownership interests in several offshore natural gas and crude oil pipelines. Other examples include our use of the Promix NGL fractionator to process NGLs extracted by our gas plants. The NGLs received from Promix then can be sold in our NGL marketing activities. Given the integral nature of our equity investees to our operations, we believe treatment of earnings from our equity method investees as a component of gross operating margin and operating income is appropriate. For additional information regarding our investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates, please read Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report.

Comparison of Results of Operations The most significant recent event affecting our results of operations was the GulfTerra Merger and related transactions. Since the closing date of the GulfTerra Merger was September 30, 2004, our Statements of Consolidated Operations do not include any earnings from GulfTerra prior to October 1, 2004. The effective closing date of our purchase of the South Texas midstream assets was September 1, 2004. As a result, our Statements of Consolidated Operations for 2004 include four months of earnings from the South Texas midstream assets. The results of operations from our other 2005, 2004 and 2003 business combinations and asset purchases are also included in our earnings from the date of their respective acquisitions. The following table summarizes the key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 12,256,959 $ 8,321,202 $ 5,346,431 Operating costs and expenses 11,546,225 7,904,336 5,046,777 General and administrative costs 62,266 46,659 37,590 Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates 14,548 52,787 (13,960 ) Operating income 663,016 422,994 248,104 Interest expense 230,549 155,740 140,806 Net income 419,508 268,261 104,546 51 Table of Contents Revenues from the sale and marketing of NGL products within the NGL Pipelines & Services business segment accounted for 67% of total consolidated revenues for each of 2005 and 2004 and 68% of total consolidated revenues for 2003. Revenues from the sale of petrochemical products within the Petrochemical Services segment accounted for 11%, 13% and 12% of total consolidated revenues for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenues from the transportation, sale and storage of natural gas using onshore assets accounted for 13%, 10% and 11% of total consolidated revenues for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our gross operating margin by segment and in total is as follows for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Gross operating margin by segment: NGL Pipelines & Services $ 579,706 $ 374,196 $ 310,677 Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 353,076 90,977 18,345 Offshore Pipeline & Services 77,505 36,478 5,561 Petrochemical Services 126,060 121,515 75,885 Other, non-segment 32,025 (53 ) Total segment gross operating margin $ 1,136,347 $ 655,191 $ 410,415 For a reconciliation of non-GAAP gross operating margin to GAAP operating income and further to GAAP income before provision for taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, please read “Other Items” included within this Item 7. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2005 with Year Ended December 31, 2004 Revenues for 2005 increased $3.9 billion over those recorded during 2004. The trend in consolidated revenues can be attributed to (i) a $2.2 billion increase in revenues from our NGL and petrochemical marketing activities resulting from an increase in sales volumes and energy commodity prices in 2005 relative to 2004; (ii) the addition of $1.5 billion in revenues from acquired or consolidated businesses, particularly those generated by the GulfTerra and South Texas midstream assets and (iii) a $0.2 billion increase in revenues from the sale of natural gas attributable to higher natural gas prices year-to-year. Consolidated costs and expenses increased $3.7 billion year-to-year primarily due to (i) higher energy commodity prices, which resulted in a $2.2 billion increase in the cost of sales of natural gas, NGLs and petrochemical products and (ii) the addition of $1.4 billion in costs and expenses attributable to acquired or consolidated businesses. General and administrative costs increased $15.6 million period-to-period as a result of our expanded business activities. Changes in our revenues and costs and expenses period-to-period are explained in part by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was 91 cents per gallon (“CPG”) during 2005 versus 73 CPG during 2004 – a year-to-year increase of 25%. Our determination of the weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs is based on U.S. Gulf Coast prices for such products at Mont Belvieu, which is the primary industry hub for domestic NGL production. The market price of natural gas (as measured at Henry Hub) averaged $8.64 per MMBtu during 2005 versus $6.13 per MMBtu during 2004. Polymer grade propylene index prices increased 27% year-to-year and refinery grade propylene index prices increased 28% year-to-year. For historical pricing information of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, please see the table on page 50. Equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $38.2 million year-to-year. Equity earnings for 2005 include a full year of our share of earnings from investments we acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger, including an $11.5 million charge associated with the refinancing of Cameron Highway’s project debt. Fiscal 2004 includes $32 million of equity earnings from GulfTerra GP, which we consolidated in September 2004 as a result of completing the GulfTerra Merger. Collectively, the 52 Table of Contents aforementioned changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity earnings contributed to a $240 million increase in operating income year-to-year. Interest expense increased $74.8 million year-to-year primarily due to debt we incurred in 2004 as a result of the GulfTerra Merger and the issuance of additional senior notes in 2005. Our average debt principal outstanding was $4.6 billion in 2005 compared to $2.8 billion in 2004. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, net income increased $151.2 million year-to-year to $419.5 million in 2005 compared to $268.3 million in 2004. Net income for both years includes the recognition of non-cash amounts related to the cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles. We recorded a $4.2 million charge in 2005 and a $10.8 million benefit in 2004 related to such changes. For additional information regarding the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles we recorded in 2005 and 2004, please read Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Due to our geographic and business diversification, Hurricanes Katrina (August 2005) and Rita (September 2005) had varying effects across our business segments. The hurricanes impacted supply and demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and motor gasoline. In general, this resulted in an increase in energy commodity prices, which was exacerbated in certain regions due to local supply and demand imbalances. The disruptions in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production along the U.S. Gulf Coast resulted in decreased volumes for some of our pipeline systems, natural gas processing plants and NGL fractionators, which in turn caused a decrease in our gross operating margin from certain operations. In addition, operating costs at certain of our plants and pipelines were negatively impacted due to the higher fuel costs. These adverse effects were mitigated by increases in gross operating margin from certain of other operations, which benefited from increased demand for NGLs and octane additives, regional demand for natural gas and the general increase in commodity prices. We estimate that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reduced our gross operating margin in 2005 by approximately $48 million as a result of decreased transportation and processing volumes and higher hurricane-related expenses and insurance premium costs. Our 2005 results of operations reflect a $4.8 million cash receipt related to the settlement of certain business interruption insurance claims from Hurricane Ivan in September 2004. We are at varying stages of the insurance claims process with respect to these hurricanes and expect to receive additional insurance recoveries in 2006 and 2007. For additional information regarding our insurance claims related to these storm events, please read “Results of Operations – Significant Risks and Uncertainties – Hurricanes” included within this Item 7. The following information highlights significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $579.7 million for 2005 versus $374.2 million for 2004. The $205.5 million increase in gross operating margin consists of the following: (i) a $186.9 million increase from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities, (ii) a $21.3 million increase from NGL fractionation and (iii) a $2.7 million decrease from NGL pipelines and related storage services. The $186.9 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities includes $122.3 million from natural gas plants acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger and $66.9 million from NGL marketing activities. Our marketing activities benefited from higher sales volumes and commodity prices during 2005 compared to 2004. The $21.3 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin from NGL fractionation includes (i) $14.9 million of improved results from our Mont Belvieu facility, (ii) $14 million from assets acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger and (iii) a $9 million decrease from our Louisiana NGL 53 Table of Contents fractionators, particularly Norco, which suffered a loss of processing volumes due to Hurricane Katrina. Our Norco NGL fractionator is expected to return to normal operating rates during 2006. The $2.7 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and related storage services was due to a variety of reasons, including (i) a net $11.2 million decrease from our Mid-America Pipeline System and Seminole Pipeline primarily due to higher fuel costs and pipeline integrity expenses, (ii) a $4.9 million decrease from our Louisiana Pipeline System primarily due to hurricane effects, (iii) a net $6.9 million increase from our import and export facilities and related Houston Ship Channel pipeline attributable to increased volumes, and (iv) a net $8.9 million increase due to acquired assets and consolidation of former equity method investees. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $353.1 million for 2005 compared to $91 million for 2004. The $262.1 million increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to onshore natural gas pipelines and storage assets acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. Gross operating margin from this segment is largely attributable to contributions from our San Juan Gathering System, Texas Intrastate System and Permian Basin System, which together generated gross operating margins in 2005 of $290.4 million. Our Petal and Hattiesburg natural gas storage facilities generated $38.7 million of gross operating margin in 2005. The San Juan Gathering System, Texas Intrastate System, Permian Basin System and Petal and Hattiesburg natural gas storage facilities were acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $77.5 million for 2005 compared to $36.5 million for 2004. The $41 million increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to offshore Gulf of Mexico assets acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. The year-to-year change in gross operating margin consists of the following: (i) a $20.1 million increase from offshore natural gas pipelines, (ii) a $26.4 million increase from offshore platforms and (iii) a $5.5 million decrease from offshore crude oil pipelines, which includes an $11.5 million charge related to the refinancing of Cameron Highway’s project debt in 2005. Petrochemical Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $126.1 million for 2005 compared to $121.5 million during 2004. The $4.6 million increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to improved results from isomerization services and octane additive production activities, both of which benefited from increased demand for motor gasoline in 2005. Other. Gross operating margin from this segment pertains to equity earnings we recorded from GulfTerra GP prior to its consolidation with our financial results in September 2004. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2004 with Year Ended December 31, 2003 Revenues for 2004 increased $3 billion over those recorded during 2003. The increase in consolidated revenues can be attributed to (i) a $2.1 billion increase in revenues from our NGL and petrochemical marketing activities primarily resulting from an increase in sales volumes and energy commodity prices in 2004 relative to 2003 and (ii) the addition of $0.8 billion in revenues from acquired assets and business combinations, particularly those resulting from the GulfTerra Merger in September 2004. Consolidated costs and expenses increased $2.9 billion year-to-year primarily due to (i) higher energy commodity prices, which resulted in a $2 billion increase in the cost of sales of our NGL and petrochemical marketing activities; (ii) the addition of $0.6 billion in costs and expenses attributable to acquired or consolidated businesses during 2004; and (iii) a $0.2 billion increase in the costs of our natural gas processing business primarily due to an increase in volumes. General and administrative costs increased $9.1 million year-to-year as a result of expanded business activities. As noted previously, changes in our revenues and costs and expenses year-to-year are explained in part by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was 73 CPG during 2004 versus 57 CPG during 2003 – a year-to-year increase of 28%. The market price of 54 Table of Contents natural gas averaged $6.13 per MMBtu during 2004 versus $5.38 per MMBtu during 2003. Polymer grade propylene index prices increased 44% year-to-year and refinery grade propylene index prices increased 61% year-to-year. Equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased $66.7 million year-to-year. Fiscal 2004 includes $32 million of equity earnings from GulfTerra GP, which we acquired in December 2003. Fiscal 2003 includes a $22.5 million non-cash asset impairment charge related to our octane additive production facility. Collectively, the aforementioned changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity earnings contributed to a $174.9 million increase in operating income year-to-year. Interest expense increased $14.9 million year-to-year primarily due to debt we incurred in 2004 as a result of the GulfTerra Merger. Our average debt principal outstanding was $2.8 billion during 2004 compared to $2 billion during 2003. As a result of the items noted in previous paragraphs, net income increased $163.8 million to $268.3 million for 2004 compared to $104.5 million for 2003. Net income for 2004 includes a $10.8 million benefit associated with the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. The following information highlights the significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $374.2 million for 2004 versus $310.7 million for 2003. The $63.5 million increase in gross operating margin includes (i) a $82 million increase from our natural gas processing business, which includes $61.2 million from assets acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger, (ii) a $20.9 million decrease from our NGL pipelines and related storage services resulting from an increase in pipeline integrity expenses and a decrease in transportation volumes on certain of our pipelines and (iii) a $6.8 million increase from our NGL fractionation business, which includes $5.8 million associated with the South Texas NGL fractionators we acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $91 million for 2004 compared to $18.3 million for 2003. The $72.7 million increase in gross operating margin for this segment is also attributable to assets acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $36.5 million for 2004 compared to $5.6 million for 2003. The $30.9 million increase from this segment is primarily due to offshore Gulf of Mexico assets acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. Petrochemical Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $121.5 million in 2004 compared to $75.9 million in 2003. Gross operating margin from our octane additive production business increased $34.4 million year-to-year primarily due to our consolidation of the results of operations of Belvieu Environmental Fuels (“BEF”). We acquired a controlling ownership interest in BEF, which owns our octane additive production facility, in September 2003. In addition, the results of operations for 2003 include the recognition by us of our share (or $22.5 million) of a $67.5 million non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by BEF prior to its consolidation. Gross operating margin from propylene fractionation increased $10.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher petrochemical marketing sales volumes, which benefited from the effects of higher polymer grade propylene prices in 2004 relative to 2003. 55 Table of Contents Significant Risks and Uncertainties – Hurricanes The following is a discussion of the general status of insurance claims related to recent hurricanes that affected our assets. To the extent we include any estimate or range of estimates regarding the dollar value of damages, please be aware that a change in our estimates may occur as additional information becomes available to us. Hurricane Ivan insurance claims. Our final purchase price allocation for the GulfTerra Merger includes a $26.2 million receivable for insurance claims related to expenditures to repair property damage to certain GulfTerra assets caused by Hurricane Ivan, which struck the eastern U.S. Gulf Coast region in September 2004 prior to the GulfTerra Merger. These expenditures represent our costs to restore the damaged facilities to operation. Since this loss event occurred prior to completion of the GulfTerra Merger, the claim was filed under the insurance program of GulfTerra and El Paso. Since year end 2005, we received cash reimbursements from insurance carriers totaling $24.1 million related to these property damage claims, and we expect to recover the remaining $2.1 million by mid-2006. If the final recovery of funds is different than the amount previously expended, we will recognize an income impact at that time. In addition, we have submitted business interruption insurance claims for our estimated losses caused by Hurricane Ivan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we received $4.8 million from such claims. In addition, we estimate an additional $15 million to $16 million will be received during the first quarter of 2006. To the extent we receive cash proceeds from such business interruption claims, they will be recorded as a gain in our statements of consolidated operations and comprehensive income in the period in which funds are received. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita insurance claims. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita affected certain of our Gulf Coast assets in August and September of 2005, respectively. Inspection, evaluation of property damage to our facilities and repairs are a continuing effort. We expensed $5 million during the third quarter of 2005 related to property damage insurance deductibles for these storms. To the extent that insurance proceeds from property damage claims do not cover our actual cash expenditures (in excess of the insurance deductibles we have expensed), such shortfall will be expensed when realized. We recorded $15.5 million of estimated recoveries from property damage claims based on amounts expended through December 31, 2005. In addition, we expect to file business interruption claims for losses related to these hurricanes. To the extent we receive cash proceeds from such business interruption claims, they will be recorded as a gain in our statements of consolidated operations and comprehensive income in the period of receipt. 56 Table of Contents General Outlook for 2006 We expect our results of operations to be affected by the following key trends and events during 2006. § We believe that drilling activity in the major producing areas where we operate, including the Rocky Mountains, San Juan Basin and deepwater Gulf of Mexico, will result in increased demand for our midstream energy services. As a result, we expect higher transportation and processing volumes for our assets due to increased natural gas and crude oil production from both the Rocky Mountains and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reduced natural gas and crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico during the latter half of 2005. Barring any other major storms or similar disruptions, we believe that Gulf of Mexico production will return to pre-hurricane levels by mid-2006. § We are currently in a major asset construction phase that began in 2005. With several major projects underway and announced to begin this year, fiscal 2006 will be a transition year as we continue to invest in multiple projects that will further diversify our portfolio of midstream assets. We believe that completion of these projects will generate additional cash flows beginning in 2006. Our significant growth capital projects are supported by long-term agreements with producers in significant supply basins, which include the Piceance Basin in Colorado, the Jonah and Pinedale fields in the Greater Green River Basin in Wyoming and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. § We believe that our natural gas and NGL facilities located in central Louisiana and our Marco Polo Oil Pipeline, Marco Polo platform and Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline located in the Gulf of Mexico are poised to benefit as production volumes increase from developments in the Southern Green Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Volumes on our Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline were adversely affected during the fourth quarter of 2005 due to disruption of production caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and these volumes are expected to continue to be adversely affected during the first quarter of 2006. However, we currently expect significant increases in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline volumes during the remainder of 2006 as production increases, including production at the Mad Dog field and initial production from the Ticonderoga, K2 North and Timon fields. § We believe that the strength of the domestic and global economy will continue to drive increased demand for all forms of energy despite higher commodity prices. Our largest NGL consuming customers in the ethylene industry continue to see strong demand for their products, which enables them to raise prices to mitigate higher fuel and feedstock costs. With the unusually high price of crude oil relative to natural gas, ethane and propane are the preferred feedstocks for the ethylene industry. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses and debt service, are for capital expenditures, business acquisitions and distributions to our partners. We expect to fund our short-term needs for such items as operating expenses and sustaining capital expenditures with operating cash flows and short-term revolving credit arrangements. Capital expenditures for long-term needs resulting from internal growth projects and business acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources (either separately or in combination) including cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under commercial bank credit facilities, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities. We expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash flows. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and/or refinancing arrangements. At December 31, 2005, we had $42.1 million of unrestricted cash on hand and approximately $727 million of available credit under our Operating Partnership’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. 57 Table of Contents In total, we had approximately $4.8 billion in principal outstanding under various debt agreements at December 31, 2005. As a result of our growth objectives, we expect to access debt and equity capital markets from time-to-time and we believe that financing arrangements to support our growth activities can be obtained on reasonable terms. Furthermore, we believe that maintenance of an investment grade credit rating combined with continued ready access to debt and equity capital at reasonable rates and sufficient trade credit to operate our businesses efficiently provide a solid foundation to meet our long and short-term liquidity and capital resource requirements. For additional information regarding our growth strategy, please read “Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. Credit Ratings At February 15, 2006, the credit ratings of our Operating Partnership’s debt securities were Baa3 with a stable outlook as rated by Moody’s Investor Services; BBB- with a stable outlook as rated by Fitch Ratings; and BB+ with a stable outlook as rated by Standard and Poor’s. In connection with the construction of our Pascagoula, Mississippi natural gas processing plant, the Operating Partnership entered into a $54 million, ten-year, fixed-rate loan with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation (“MBFC”). The indenture agreement for this loan contains an acceleration clause whereby if the Operating Partnership’s credit rating by Moody’s declines below Baa3 in combination with our credit rating at Standard & Poor’s remaining at BB+ or lower, the $54 million principal balance of this loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest would become immediately due and payable 120 days following such event. If such an event occurred, we would have to either redeem the Pascagoula MBFC Loan or provide an alternative credit agreement to support our obligation under this loan. Registration Statements From time-to-time, we issue equity or debt securities to assist us in meeting our liquidity and capital spending requirements. In March 2005, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the issuance of $4 billion of equity and debt securities. After taking into account our issuance of securities under this universal registration statement during 2005, we can issue an additional $3.4 billion of securities under this registration statement as of February 15, 2006. During 2003, we instituted a distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”). The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they would otherwise receive into the purchase of additional common units. We have a registration statement on file with the SEC covering the issuance of up to 15,000,000 common units in connection with the DRIP. A total of 10,925,102 common units have been issued under this registration statement through February 15, 2006. We also have a registration statement on file related to our employee unit purchase plan, under which we can issue up to 1,200,000 common units. Under this plan, employees of EPCO can purchase our common units at a 10% discount through payroll deductions. A total of 260,222 common units have been issued to employees under this plan through February 15, 2006. For information regarding our public debt obligations or partnership equity, please read Note 14 and 15, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 58 Table of Contents Debt Obligations For detailed information regarding our consolidated debt obligations and those of our unconsolidated affiliates, please read Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report.

(2) Senior Notes I were issued at 99.379% of their face amount in February 2005. (3) Senior Notes J were issued at 98.691% of their face amount in February 2005. (4) Senior Notes K were issued at 99.834% of their face amount in June 2005. (5) The December 31, 2005 amount includes $18.2 million related to fair value hedges and $14.1 million in net unamortized discounts. The December 31, 2004 amount includes $1.8 million related to fair value hedges and $9.2 million in net unamortized discounts. (6) In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 6, “Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to Be Refinanced,” long-term and current maturities of debt at December 31, 2004, reflected (i) our refinancing of Senior Notes A with proceeds from our Senior Notes I and J in March 2005 and (ii) the repayment of our 364-Day Acquisition Facility using proceeds from an equity offering completed in February 2005. 59 Table of Contents Our significant debt-related transactions during 2005 were as follows: § In February 2005, we completed repayment of the 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility using proceeds from our February 2005 equity offering. § Also in February 2005, we issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes I and J. A portion of the proceeds from these Senior Notes were used to repay Senior Notes A, which matured in March 2005. § In June 2005, we issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes K. § In October 2005, the borrowing capacity under the Operating Partnership’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility was increased from $750 million to $1.25 billion, with the possibility that the borrowing capacity could be increased further to $1.4 billion (subject to certain conditions). In addition, the maturity date for debt outstanding under this facility was extended from September 2009 to October 2010. § In December 2005, Seminole Pipeline Company, a majority-owned subsidiary, made the final payment on its indebtedness. We have three unconsolidated affiliates with long-term debt obligations. The following table summarizes the debt obligations of these unconsolidated affiliates (on a 100% basis to the joint venture) at December 31, 2005 and our ownership interest in each entity on that date (dollars in thousands): Our Ownership Interest Total Cameron Highway 50.0 % $ 415,000 Poseidon 36.0 % 95,000 Evangeline 49.5 % 30,650 Total $ 540,650 For information regarding the scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations and estimated cash payments for interest, please read “Contractual Obligations” within this Item 7. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands). For information regarding the individual components of our cash flow amounts, please see the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Item 8 of this annual report. For Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided from operating activities $ 631,708 $ 391,541 $ 424,705 Net cash used in investing activities 1,130,395 941,424 662,076 Net cash provided by financing activities 516,229 543,973 254,020 We prepare our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows using the indirect method. The indirect method derives net cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income to remove (i) the effects of all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments, such as changes during the period in inventory, deferred income and the like, (ii) the effects of all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and cash payments, such as changes during the period in receivables and payables, and (iii) the effects of all items classified as investing or financing cash flows, such as gains or losses on sale of assets or gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt. In general, the net effect of changes in operating accounts results from the timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for purchases and other expenses during 60 Table of Contents each period. Increases or decreases in inventory balances are influenced by changes in commodity prices and the quantity of products held in connection with our marketing activities. In addition, noncash items that were subtracted in determining income must be added back in determining net cash flows from operating activities. Each of these noncash items is a charge against income but does not decrease cash. Items to be added back include depreciation, amortization of intangibles, amortization in interest expense, operating lease expense paid by EPCO, provisions for impairments of long-lived assets and increases in deferred tax liabilities. Conversely, noncash items that were added in determining income (such as amortization of bond premiums or decreases in deferred tax liabilities) must be subtracted in determining net cash flows from operating activities. Equity in income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates is also a non-cash item that must be removed in determining net cash flows from operating activities. Our cash flows from operating activities reflect the actual cash distributions we receive from such investees. Net cash provided from operating activities is largely dependent on earnings from our business activities. As a result, these cash flows are exposed to certain risks. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry. We provide services for producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. The products that we process, sell or transport are principally used as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating; feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing; and in the production of motor gasoline. Reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers, whether because of general economic conditions, reduced demand for the end products made with our products or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons could have a negative impact on our earnings and thus the availability of cash from operating activities. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, please read Item 1A of this annual report. Cash used in investing activities primarily represents expenditures for capital projects, business combinations, asset purchases and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Cash provided by (or used in) financing activities generally consists of borrowings and repayments of debt, distributions to partners and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities. Amounts presented in our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for borrowings and repayments under debt agreements are influenced by the magnitude of cash receipts and payments under our revolving credit facilities. The following information highlights the significant year-to-year variances in our cash flow amounts: Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2005 with Year Ended December 31, 2004 Operating activities. Net cash provided from operating activities was $631.7 million in 2005 compared to $391.5 million in 2004. The $240.2 million, or 61%, year-to-year increase in net cash provided from operating activities is primarily due to: § Net income adjusted for all non-cash items and the net effects of changes in operating accounts increased $252.1 million year-to-year primarily due to the addition of earnings from assets acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger in September 2004. § Distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $12 million year-to-year primarily due to the consolidation of GulfTerra GP in September 2004 partially offset by increased cash distributions from offshore Gulf of Mexico investments. GulfTerra GP accounted for $32.3 million in cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates during 2004. The carrying value of our inventories increased from $189 million at December 31, 2004 to $339.6 million at December 31, 2005. The $150.6 million increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices during 2005 when compared to 2004 and an increase in volumes purchased and held in inventory in connection with our marketing activities at December 31, 2005 versus December 31, 2004. 61 Table of Contents Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion in 2005 compared to $941.4 million in 2004. Expenditures for growth and sustaining capital projects (net of contributions in aid of construction costs) increased $670.5 million year-to-year primarily due to cash payments associated with our offshore Gulf of Mexico projects. Our cash outlays for asset purchases and business combinations were $326.6 million in 2005 versus $724.7 million in 2004. The 2004 period includes $638.8 million paid to El Paso in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates increased to $87.3 million in 2005 from $57.9 million in 2004. In 2005, we contributed $72 million to Deepwater Gateway, L.L.C. to fund our share of the repayment of its term loan. During 2004, we used $27.5 million to acquire additional ownership interests in Promix, which owns the Promix NGL fractionator, and contributed $24 million to Cameron Highway for the construction of its crude oil pipeline. Cash flows related to investing activities for 2005 also include (i) a $47.5 million cash receipt related to the partial return of our investment in Cameron Highway and (ii) a $42.1 million cash receipt from the sale of our investment in Starfish Pipeline Company, LLC (“Starfish”). The sale of our Starfish investment was required by the FTC in order to gain its approval for the GulfTerra Merger. For additional information related to our capital spending program, please read “Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. Financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $516.2 million in 2005 compared to $544 million in 2004. We had net borrowings under our debt agreements of $561.7 million during 2005 versus $125.6 million during 2004. During 2005, we issued an aggregate $1 billion in senior notes, the proceeds of which were used to temporarily reduce debt outstanding under our bank credit facilities, repay Senior Notes A and for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures, asset purchases and business combinations. In addition, we repaid the remaining $242.2 million that was outstanding at the end of 2004 under our 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility using proceeds from our February 2005 equity offering. We used the net proceeds from our November 2005 equity offering to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under our Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In September 2004, we borrowed $2.8 billion under our bank credit facilities (principally the 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility) to fund $655.3 million in cash payment obligations to El Paso in connection with the GulfTerra Merger; purchase $1.1 billion of GulfTerra’s senior and senior subordinated notes in connection with our tender offers; and repay $962 million outstanding under GulfTerra’s revolving credit facility and secured term loans. In October 2004, we issued an aggregate $2 billion in senior notes, the proceeds of which were used to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our bank credit facilities. Our repayments of debt during 2004 also reflect the use of $563.1 million of net proceeds from our May 2004 and August 2004 equity offerings to reduce indebtedness under bank credit facilities. Net proceeds from the issuance of limited partner interests were $646.9 million in 2005 compared to $846.1 million in 2004. We issued 23,979,740 common units in 2005 and 39,683,591 common units in 2004. Net proceeds from underwritten equity offerings were $555.5 million during 2005 reflecting the sale of 21,250,000 units and $694.3 million during 2004 reflecting the sale of 34,500,000 units. We used net proceeds from these underwritten offerings to reduce debt, including the temporary repayment of indebtedness under bank credit facilities. Our distribution reinvestment program and related plan generated net proceeds of $69.7 million in 2005 and $111.6 million in 2004. We used net proceeds from these offerings for general partnership purposes. For additional information regarding our equity issuances, please read Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Cash distributions to partners increased from $438.8 million in 2004 to $716.7 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in common units outstanding and our quarterly cash distribution rates. We expect that future cash distributions to partners will increase as a result of our periodic issuance of common units. Cash contributions from minority interests were $39.1 million in 2005 compared to $9.6 million in 62 Table of Contents 2004. These amounts relate to contributions from our joint venture partner in the Independence Hub project. Our financing activities for 2004 include a net cash receipt of $19.4 million resulting from the settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2004 with Year Ended December 31, 2003 Operating activities. Net cash provided from operating activities was $391.5 million in 2004 compared to $424.7 million in 2003. The $33.2 million decrease in net cash provided from operating activities is primarily due to (i) net income adjusted for all non-cash items and the net effects of changes in operating accounts decreased $69.3 million year-to-year primarily due to timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for purchases and other expenses between periods and (ii) distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates increased $36.1 million year-to-year primarily due to distributions from GulfTerra GP, which we acquired in December 2003. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $941.4 million in 2004 compared to $662.1 million in 2003. We used $638.8 million in 2004 to complete the GulfTerra Merger, including our purchase of the South Texas midstream assets. Our expenditures for other asset purchases and business combinations were $724.7 million in 2004 versus $37.3 million in 2003. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates were $57.9 million in 2004 compared to $463.9 million in 2003, which includes our $425 million cash payment to El Paso to acquire GulfTerra GP in December 2003. Expenditures for growth and sustaining capital projects (net of contributions in aid of construction costs) were essentially flat year-to-year at approximately $146 million for each period. Financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $544 million in 2004 compared to $254 million in 2003. We had net borrowings of $125.6 million during 2004 compared to net repayments of $106.8 million during 2003. As discussed under “Financing activities” on page 62, net borrowings during 2004 primarily reflect debt transactions associated with the GulfTerra Merger. Our borrowing transactions during 2003 include the issuance of an aggregate $850 million in senior notes and the borrowing of $425 million under a bank credit facility to purchase GulfTerra GP. Repayments of debt during 2003 reflect the use of net proceeds from debt and equity offerings completed in 2003 to reduce indebtedness under bank credit facilities, including the repayment of $1 billion outstanding under a term loan we used to acquire ownership interests in the Mid-America Pipeline System and Seminole Pipeline. Net proceeds from the issuance of limited partner interests were $846.1 million in 2004 compared to $675.7 million in 2003. We issued 39,683,591 common units in 2004 and 29,506,303 common units in 2003. Net proceeds from underwritten equity offerings were $694.3 million during 2004 reflecting the sale of 34,500,000 units and $519.2 million during 2003 reflecting the sale of 26,622,500 units. We used net proceeds from these underwritten offerings primarily to reduce debt, including the temporary repayment of indebtedness under bank credit facilities. In addition, we received $100 million from the sale of 4,413,549 Class B special units to an affiliate of EPCO in 2003. The Class B special units converted to common units in July 2004. Our distribution reinvestment program and related plan generated net proceeds of $111.6 million in 2004 and $60.3 million in 2003. We used net proceeds from these offerings for general partnership purposes. The year-to-year increase in net proceeds from our distribution reinvestment program is attributable to EPCO, which publicly announced in 2003 that it would reinvest approximately $140 million of its cash distributions in support of our growth objectives. This commitment extended from the distribution paid in February 2004 to the distribution paid in February 2005. Cash distributions to partners increased from $309.9 million in 2003 to $438.8 million in 2004 primarily due to an increase in distribution-bearing units outstanding and higher cash distribution rates. Financing activities include net cash receipts of $19.4 million in 2004 and $5.4 million in 2003 resulting from the settlement of interest rate hedging financial instruments. 63 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2005. A description of each type of contractual obligation follows (dollars in thousands). Payment or Settlement due by Period Less than 1-3 3-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years (2006) (2007 – 2008) (2009 – 2010) Beyond 2010 Scheduled Maturities of Long-Term Debt $ 4,866,068 $ 517,000 $ 1,549,068 $ 2,800,000 Estimated Cash Payments for Interest $ 3,160,380 $ 271,597 $ 518,809 $ 455,189 $ 1,914,785 Operating Lease Obligations $ 179,623 $ 19,099 $ 33,848 $ 20,089 $ 106,587 Purchase Obligations: Product purchase commitments: Estimated payment obligations: Natural gas $ 1,518,016 $ 216,690 $ 433,973 $ 433,380 $ 433,973 NGLs $ 6,095,907 $ 684,250 $ 1,118,948 $ 999,800 $ 3,292,909 Petrochemicals $ 1,290,952 $ 1,079,110 $ 211,842 Other $ 87,162 $ 31,578 $ 44,724 $ 10,860 Underlying major volume commitments: Natural gas (in BBtus) 127,850 18,250 36,550 36,500 36,550 NGLs (in MBbls) 63,130 9,251 12,827 10,172 30,880 Petrochemicals (in MBbls) 19,717 16,525 3,192 Service payment commitments $ 5,765 $ 5,037 $ 728 Capital expenditure commitments $ 208,575 $ 208,575 Other Long-Term Liabilities, as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet $ 84,486 $ 24,828 $ 9,897 $ 49,761 Total $ 17,496,934 $ 2,515,936 $ 2,904,700 $ 3,478,283 $ 8,598,015 Scheduled Maturities of Long-Term Debt We have long and short-term payment obligations under debt agreements such as the indentures governing our Operating Partnership’s senior notes and the credit agreement governing our Operating Partnership’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts shown in the table represent our scheduled future maturities of long-term debt principal for the periods indicated. For additional information regarding our debt obligations, please read Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Estimated Cash Payments for Interest We are obligated to make interest payments on our debt principal amounts outstanding. The amounts shown in the preceding table for estimated cash interest payments represent our forecast of variable and fixed interest payments to be made in connection with debt principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2005. Our estimates of future cash interest payments include the following amounts to be paid in connection with variable interest rates: $146.6 million in total, $31.5 million for 2006, $31.2 million for 2007, $30.8 million for each of 2008 and 2009, and $22.3 million for 2010. We estimated our variable interest rate cash payments by multiplying the weighted-average variable interest rate paid during 2005 (under each of our variable rate debt obligations that were outstanding at December 31, 2005) by the debt principal amount outstanding at that date and assumed that the balance outstanding would not change until maturity. Our estimates of cash interest payments to be paid under fixed interest rate obligations were determined by multiplying the fixed interest rate associated with each fixed-rate obligation for each period that the principal would be outstanding until maturity. To the extent that we have exchanged a fixed interest rate for a variable interest rate, we have included the impact of such interest rate swap agreements in our calculations. Our internal estimates of long-term interest rates indicate that variable interest rates may exceed the fixed interest rates of the debt obligations underlying our interest rate swap agreements. If this occurs, we are responsible for payment of the excess of the current variable interest rate over the fixed 64 Table of Contents interest rate of the underlying debt obligation. For conservatism, the amounts shown in the table above do not reflect any cash receipts from interest rate swap agreements (i.e. net reductions in cash outlays for interest) when the variable interest rate is less than the fixed interest rate of the underlying debt obligations. For information regarding our interest rate swap agreements, please read Item 7A of this annual report. Operating Lease Obligations We lease certain property, plant and equipment under noncancelable and cancelable operating leases. Amounts shown in the preceding table represent minimum cash lease payment obligations under our third-party operating leases with terms in excess of one year for the periods indicated. For additional information regarding our operating lease commitments, please read Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Purchase Obligations We define a purchase obligation as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (unconditional) on us that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. We have classified our unconditional purchase obligations into the following categories: Product purchase commitments. We have long and short-term product purchase obligations for NGLs, petrochemicals and natural gas with third-party suppliers. The prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. The preceding table shows our volume commitments and estimated payment obligations under these contracts for the periods indicated. Our estimated future payment obligations are based on the contractual price under each contract for purchases made at December 31, 2005 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on market prices at the time of delivery. Service contract commitments. We have long and short-term commitments to pay third-party providers for services such as maintenance agreements. Our contractual payment obligations vary by contract. The preceding table shows our future payment obligations under these service contracts. Capital expenditure commitments. We have short-term payment obligations relating to capital projects we have initiated and are also responsible for our share of such obligations associated with the capital projects of our unconsolidated affiliates. These commitments represent unconditional payment obligations that we or our unconsolidated affiliates have agreed to pay vendors for services rendered or products purchased. The preceding table shows these combined amounts for the periods indicated. Other Long-Term Liabilities We have recorded long-term liabilities on our balance sheet reflecting amounts we expect to pay in future periods beyond one year. These liabilities primarily relate to reserves for asset retirement obligations, environmental liabilities and other amounts. Amounts shown in the preceding table represent our best estimate as to the timing of payments based on available information. 65 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Cameron Highway issued senior secured notes in December 2005. We secure a portion of these notes by (i) a pledge by us of our 50% partnership interest in Cameron Highway, (ii) mortgages on and pledges of certain assets related to certain rights of way and pipeline assets of an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ours that serves as the operator of the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline, and (iii) letters of credit in an initial amount of $18.4 million issued by the Operating Partnership on behalf of Cameron Highway. For more information regarding Cameron Highway’s senior secured notes, please read Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. In addition, we have furnished $1.2 million in letters of credit on behalf of Evangeline at December 31, 2005. We currently expect that Cameron Highway will seek to amend its senior secured notes during 2006 to address delayed increases in volumes due to disruptions of production caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, but we believe that such amendments will be obtained without any material adverse effect on us. Except for the foregoing, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements, as described in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS The following information summarizes recently issued accounting guidance that will (or may) affect our financial statements in the future: § SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) 25 and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value method. Historically, we have accounted for our share-based transactions using APB 25. We adopted SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006, which resulted in our recording a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $0.3 million. During 2006, we expect to record compensation expense of $7 million associated with the fair value method of accounting for unit options, profits interests and nonvested (or restricted) units using SFAS 123(R) based on awards outstanding at January 1, 2006. § SFAS 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. We adopted SFAS 154 on January 1, 2006. § Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and Sale of Inventory With the Same Counterparty,” requires that two or more inventory transactions with the same counterparty be viewed as a single nonmonetary transaction, if the transactions were entered into in contemplation of one another. Exchanges of inventory between entities in the same line of business should be accounted for at fair value or recorded at carrying amounts, depending on the classification of such inventory. We are still evaluating this recent guidance, which is effective April 1, 2006 for our partnership, but we do not believe that our revenues or costs and expenses will be materially affected. 66 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In our financial reporting process, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following describes the estimation risk underlying our most significant financial statement items: Depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the assets. Our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts on a going forward basis. Some of these circumstances include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration and abandonment requirements; changes in expected costs for dismantlement, restoration and abandonment as a result of changes, or expected changes, in labor, materials and other related costs associated with these activities; changes in the useful life of an asset based on the actual known life of similar assets, changes in technology, or other factors; and changes in expected salvage proceeds as a result of a change, or expected change in the salvage market. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was $8.7 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively. We recorded $328.7 million, $161 million and $101 million in depreciation expense during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A significant portion of the year-to-year increase in depreciation expense between 2005 and 2004 is attributable to the property, plant and equipment assets we acquired in the GulfTerra Merger in September 2004. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, please read Notes 2 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring recoverability of long-lived assets and equity method investments In general, long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, oil or NGLs. Long-lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through future expected cash flows are written-down to their estimated fair values. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the existing asset. Our estimates of such undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated salvage values. An impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is based on a series of assumptions similar to those used to derive undiscounted cash flows. Those assumptions also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes, market values and replacement cost estimates. We recorded $1.2 million and $4.1 million for asset impairment charges in 2003 and 2004, respectively, related to NGL fractionation and storage facilities located in Mississippi. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible loss in value for the investment other than a temporary decline. Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee’s industry. The carrying value of an equity method investment is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of discounted estimated cash flows expected to be derived from the investment. This estimate of discounted cash flows is based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; 67 Table of Contents probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment. A significant change in these underlying assumptions could result in our recording an impairment charge. Due to a deteriorating business environment, BEF evaluated the carrying value of its long-lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2003. This review indicated that the carrying value of its long-lived assets exceeded their collective fair value, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $67.5 million. Since BEF was one of our equity investments at that time, our share of this loss was $22.5 million and was recorded as a component of equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates during 2003. For additional information regarding our asset impairment charges, please read Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Amortization methods and estimated useful lives of qualifying intangible assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential intangible assets include intellectual property, such as technology, patents, trademarks and trade names, customer contracts and relationships, and non-compete agreements, as well as other intangible assets. The method used to value each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset, the business in which it is utilized, and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. Our customer relationship intangible assets primarily represent the customer base we acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger and related transactions. The value we assigned to these customer relationships is being amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits of the underlying oil and natural gas resource bases from which the customers produce are estimated to be consumed or otherwise used. Our estimate of the useful life of each resource base is based on a number of factors, including third-party reserve estimates, the economic viability of production and exploration activities and other industry factors. Our contract-based intangible assets represent the rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated useful life (or term), which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of an entity. Our estimates of useful life are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., fractionation facility, pipeline, etc.), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights, and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such agreements. If our underlying assumptions regarding the estimated useful life of an intangible asset change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, if we determine that an intangible asset’s unamortized cost may not be recoverable due to impairment; we may be required to reduce the carrying value and the subsequent useful life of the asset. Any such write-down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was $913.6 million and $980.6 million, respectively. We recorded $88.9 million, $33.8 million and $14.8 million in amortization expense associated with our intangible assets during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A significant portion of the year-to-year increase in amortization expense between 2005 and 2004 is attributable to the intangible assets we acquired in the GulfTerra Merger. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, please read Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 68 Table of Contents Methods we employ to measure the fair value of goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase prices we paid for certain businesses over their respective fair values and is primarily comprised of $387.1 million associated with the GulfTerra Merger. We do not amortize goodwill; however, we test our goodwill (at the reporting unit level) for impairment during the second quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Our goodwill testing involves the determination of a reporting unit’s fair value, which is predicated on our assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the reporting unit. Such assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the assets contained within the reporting unit, which rely on management’s estimates of operating margins and transportation volumes, (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period, and (iii) appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of the reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a charge to earnings is required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying value of our goodwill was $494 million and $459.2 million, respectively. For additional information regarding our goodwill, please read Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our revenue recognition policies and use of estimates for revenues and expenses In general, we recognize revenue from our customers when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. When sales contracts are settled (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed), we record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts. Our use of certain estimates for revenues and operating costs and other expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the timing of compiling actual billing information and receiving third-party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of such use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for the subject period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month, adjusted accordingly for any known or expected changes in volumes or rates through the end of the month. If the basis of our estimates proves to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. Reserves for environmental matters Each of our business segments is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations may, in certain instances, require us to remediate current or former operating sites where specified substances have been released or disposed of. We accrue reserves for environmental matters when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments are based on studies, as well as site surveys, to determine the extent of any environmental damage and the necessary requirements to remediate this damage. Future environmental developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws and additional claims for damages to property, employees and other persons resulting from current or past operations, could result in substantial additional costs beyond our current reserves. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a liability for environmental remediation of $21 million, which was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon studies and site surveys. In accordance with SFAS 5 “Accounting for Contingencies” and Financial Accounting Standards Board 69 Table of Contents Interpretation (“FIN”) 14, “Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss,” we recorded our best estimate of these remediation activities. Natural gas imbalances Natural gas imbalances result when customers physically deliver a larger or smaller quantity of natural gas into our pipelines than they take out. In general, we value such imbalances using a twelve-month moving average of natural gas prices, which we believe is reasonable given that the actual settlement dates for such imbalances are generally not known. As a result, significant changes in natural gas prices between reporting periods may impact our estimates. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our imbalance receivables were $89.4 million and $56.7 million, respectively, and are reflected as a component of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our imbalance payables were $80.5 million and $59 million, respectively, and are reflected as a component of accrued gas payables. SUMMARY OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In accordance with SFAS 57, “Related Party Disclosures,” we have identified our material related party revenues and costs and expenses. The following table summarizes our related party transactions for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands). For Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Revenues from consolidated operations EPCO and affiliates $ 311 $ 2,697 $ 4,241 Shell 542,912 293,109 Unconsolidated affiliates 354,461 258,541 266,894 Total $ 354,772 $ 804,150 $ 564,244 Operating costs and expenses EPCO and affiliates $ 293,134 $ 203,100 $ 149,915 Shell 725,420 607,277 Unconsolidated affiliates 23,563 37,587 43,752 Total $ 316,697 $ 966,107 $ 800,944 General and administrative expenses EPCO and affiliates $ 40,954 $ 29,307 $ 28,716 For additional information regarding our related party transactions identified in accordance with GAAP, please read Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. For information regarding certain business relationships and related transactions, please read Item 13 of this annual report. We have an extensive and ongoing relationship with EPCO and its affiliates, including TEPPCO. Our revenues from EPCO and affiliates are primarily associated with sales of NGL products. Our expenses with EPCO are primarily due to (i) reimbursements we pay EPCO in connection with an administrative services agreement and (ii) purchases of NGL products. TEPPCO is an affiliate of ours due to the common control relationship of both entities. Historically, Shell was considered a related party under GAAP because it owned more than 10% of our limited partner interests and, prior to 2003, held a 30% membership interest in Enterprise Products GP. As a result of Shell selling a portion of its limited partner interests in us to third parties and our issuance of additional common units, Shell owned less than 10% of our common units at the beginning of 2005. Shell sold its 30% interest in Enterprise Products GP to an affiliate of EPCO in September 2003. As a result of Shell’s reduced equity interest in us and its lack of control of Enterprise Products GP, Shell ceased to be considered a related party under GAAP in January 2005. 70 Table of Contents Many of our unconsolidated affiliates perform supporting or complementary roles to our consolidated business operations. The majority of our revenues from unconsolidated affiliates relate to natural gas sales to a Louisiana affiliate. The majority of our expenses with unconsolidated affiliates pertain to payments to Promix for NGL transportation, storage and fractionation services. OTHER ITEMS Non-GAAP reconciliation A reconciliation of our measurement of total non-GAAP gross operating margin to GAAP operating income and income before provision for income taxes, minority interest and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles follows (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Total non-GAAP gross operating margin $ 1,136,347 $ 655,191 $ 410,415 Adjustments to reconcile total non-GAAP gross operating margin to GAAP operating income: Depreciation and amortization in operating costs and expenses (413,441 ) (193,734 ) (115,643 ) Retained lease expense, net in operating costs and expenses (2,112 ) (7,705 ) (9,094 ) Gain on sale of assets in operating costs and expenses 4,488 15,901 16 General and administrative costs (62,266 ) (46,659 ) (37,590 ) GAAP consolidated operating income 663,016 422,994 248,104 Other net expense, primarily interest expense (225,178 ) (153,625 ) (134,406 ) GAAP income before provision for income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 437,838 $ 269,369 $ 113,698 EPCO subleases to us certain equipment located at our Mont Belvieu facility and 100 railcars for $1 per year (the “retained leases”). These subleases are part of the administrative services agreement that we executed with EPCO in connection with our formation in 1998. EPCO holds this equipment pursuant to operating leases for which it has retained the corresponding cash lease payment obligation. We record the full value of such lease payments made by EPCO as a non-cash related party operating expense, with the offset to partners’ equity recorded as a general contribution to our partnership. Apart from the partnership interests we granted to EPCO at our formation, EPCO does not receive any additional ownership rights as a result of its contribution to us of the retained leases. For additional information regarding the administrative services agreement and the retained leases, please read Item 13 of this annual report. Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles Our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income reflect the following cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles: § We recorded a $4.2 million non-cash expense related to certain asset retirement obligations in 2005 due to our implementation of FIN 47 as of December 31, 2005. § We recorded a combined $10.8 million non-cash gain in 2004 related to the impact of (i) changing the method our BEF subsidiary uses to account for its planned major maintenance activities from the accrue-in-advance method to the expense-as-incurred method and (ii) changing the method in which we account for our investment in VESCO from the cost method to the equity method. For additional information regarding these changes in accounting principles, including a presentation of the pro forma effects these changes would have had on our historical earnings, please read Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 71 Table of Contents Financial statement reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. During 2005, we changed the classification of changes in restricted cash in our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows to present such changes as an investing activity. We previously presented such changes as an operating activity. In the accompanying Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we reclassified the change in restricted cash to be consistent with our 2005 presentation. This reclassification resulted in a $12.3 million and $5.1 million increase to cash flows used in investing activities and a corresponding increase to cash provided by operating activities from the amounts previously presented for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in commodity prices and interest rates. We may use financial instruments (i.e., futures, forwards, swaps, options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics) to mitigate the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions. In general, the type of risks we attempt to hedge are those related to the variability of future earnings, fair values of certain debt instruments and cash flows resulting from changes in applicable interest rates or commodity prices. As a matter of policy, we do not use financial instruments for speculative (or “trading”) purposes. We recognize financial instruments as assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on fair value. Fair value is generally defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, not in a forced or liquidation sale. The estimated fair values of our financial instruments have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques. We must use considerable judgment, however, in interpreting market data and developing these estimates. Accordingly, our fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize upon disposition of these instruments. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation techniques could have a material effect on our estimates of fair value. Changes in the fair value of financial instrument contracts are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the financial instruments meet those criteria, the instrument’s gains and losses offset the related results of the hedged item in earnings for a fair value hedge and are deferred in other comprehensive income for a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses related to a cash flow hedge are reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For additional information regarding our accounting for financial instruments, please read Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. To qualify as a hedge, the item to be hedged must be exposed to commodity or interest rate risk and the hedging instrument must reduce the exposure and meet the hedging requirements of SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (as amended and interpreted). We must formally designate the financial instrument as a hedge and document and assess the effectiveness of the hedge at inception and on a quarterly basis. Any ineffectiveness of the hedge is recorded in current earnings. We routinely review our outstanding financial instruments in light of current market conditions. If market conditions warrant, some financial instruments may be closed out in advance of their contractual settlement dates thus realizing income or loss depending on the specific exposure. When this occurs, we may enter into a new financial instrument to reestablish the economic hedge to which the closed instrument relates. Interest Rate Risk Hedging Program Our interest rate exposure results from variable and fixed rate borrowings under debt agreements. We assess cash flow risk related to interest rates by identifying and measuring changes in our interest rate 72 Table of Contents exposures that may impact future cash flows and evaluating hedging opportunities to manage these risks. We use analytical techniques to measure our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, including cash flow sensitivity analysis models to forecast the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows. Enterprise Products GP oversees the strategies associated with these financial risks and approves instruments that are appropriate for our requirements. We manage a portion of our interest rate exposures by utilizing interest rate swaps and similar arrangements, which allow us to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt or a portion of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt. We believe that it is prudent to maintain an appropriate balance of variable rate and fixed rate debt in the current business environment. As summarized in the following table, we had eleven interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2005 that were accounted for as fair value hedges. Number Period Covered Termination Fixed to Notional Hedged Fixed Rate Debt Of Swaps by Swap Date of Swap Variable Rate (1) Amount Senior Notes B, 7.50% fixed rate, due Feb. 2011 1 Jan. 2004 to Feb. 2011 Feb. 2011 7.50% to 7.26% $50 million Senior Notes C, 6.375% fixed rate, due Feb. 2013 2 Jan. 2004 to Feb. 2013 Feb. 2013 6.375% to 5.8% $200 million Senior Notes G, 5.6% fixed rate, due Oct. 2014 6 4th Qtr. 2004 to Oct. 2014 Oct. 2014 5.6% to 5.24% $600 million Senior Notes K, 4.95% fixed rate, due June 2010 2 Aug. 2005 to June 2010 June 2010 4.95% to 4.99% $200 million (1) The variable rate indicated is the all-in variable rate for the current settlement period. We have designated these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges under SFAS 133 since they mitigate changes in the fair value of the underlying fixed rate debt. As effective fair value hedges, an increase in the fair value of these interest rate swaps is equally offset by an increase in the fair value of the underlying hedged debt. The offsetting changes in fair value have no effect on current period interest expense. These eleven agreements have a combined notional amount of $1.1 billion and match the maturity dates of the underlying debt being hedged. Under each swap agreement, we pay the counterparty a variable interest rate based on six-month London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) (plus an applicable margin as defined in each swap agreement), and receive back from the counterparty a fixed interest rate payment based on the stated interest rate of the debt being hedged, with both payments calculated using the notional amounts stated in each swap agreement. We settle amounts receivable from or payable to the counterparties every six months (the “settlement period”). The settlement amount is amortized ratably to earnings as either an increase or a decrease in interest expense over the settlement period. The total fair value of these eleven interest rate swaps at December 31, 2005, was a liability of $19.2 million, with an offsetting decrease in the fair value of the underlying debt. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 reflects a $10.8 million and $9.1 million benefit from these swap agreements, respectively. The following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap portfolio and the related change in fair value of the underlying debt at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). Income is not affected by changes in the fair value of these swaps; however, these swaps effectively convert the hedged portion of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. As a result, interest expense (and related cash outlays for debt service) will increase or decrease with the change in the periodic “reset” rate associated with the respective swap. Typically, the reset rate is an agreed upon index rate published for the first day of the six-month interest calculation period. Resulting Swap Fair Value at Scenario Classification December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 February 1, 2006 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) $ 505 $ (19,179 ) $ (28,621 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) (31,586 ) (50,308 ) (59,744 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) 32,596 11,950 2,503 73 Table of Contents The fair value of the interest rate swaps excludes the benefit we have already recorded in earnings. The change in fair value between December 31, 2005 and February 1, 2006 is primarily due to an increase in market interest rates relative to the forward interest rate curve used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. The underlying floating LIBOR forward interest rate curve used to determine the February 1, 2006 fair values ranged from approximately 4.3% to 5.2% using 6-month reset periods ranging from October 2005 to October 2014. Commodity Risk Hedging Program The prices of natural gas, NGLs and petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage the risks associated with natural gas and NGLs, we may enter into commodity financial instruments. The primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to price risks associated with (i) natural gas purchases, (ii) NGL production and inventories, (iii) related firm commitments, (iv) fluctuations in transportation revenues where the underlying fees are based on natural gas index prices and (v) certain anticipated transactions involving either natural gas or NGLs. The commodity financial instruments we utilize may be settled in cash or with another financial instrument. Historically, we have not hedged our exposure to risks associated with petrochemical products. We have adopted a policy to govern our use of commodity financial instruments to manage the risks of our natural gas and NGL businesses. The objective of this policy is to assist us in achieving our profitability goals while maintaining a portfolio with an acceptable level of risk, defined as remaining within the position limits established by Enterprise Products GP. We may enter into risk management transactions to manage price risk, basis risk, physical risk or other risks related to our commodity positions on both a short-term (less than 30 days) and long-term basis, not to exceed 24 months. Enterprise Products GP oversees the strategies associated with physical and financial risks (such as those mentioned previously), approves specific activities subject to the policy (including authorized products, instruments and markets) and establishes specific guidelines and procedures for implementing and ensuring compliance with the policy. At December 31, 2005, we had a limited number of commodity financial instruments in our portfolio, which primarily consisted of economic hedges. The fair value of our commodity financial instrument portfolio at December 31, 2005 was a liability of $0.1 million. We recorded nominal amounts of earnings from our commodity financial instruments during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Product Purchase Commitments We have long and short-term purchase commitments for NGLs, petrochemicals and natural gas with several suppliers. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. For additional information regarding these commitments, please read “Contractual Obligations” included under Item 7 of this annual report. 74 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:16:38.954503

In addition, we are an industry leader in the development of pipeline and other midstream energy infrastructure in the continental United States and Gulf of Mexico. We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 1998, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.” We conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership. We are owned 98% by our limited partners and 2% by our general partner, referred to as Enterprise Products GP. Enterprise Products GP is owned 100% by Enterprise GP Holdings, a publicly traded affiliate listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “EPE.” We, Enterprise Products GP and Enterprise GP Holdings are affiliates and under common control of Dan L. Duncan, the Chairman and the controlling shareholder of EPCO. Our midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the United States, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. We have four reportable business segments: NGL Pipelines & Services; Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services; Offshore Pipelines & Services; and Petrochemical Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the type of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. Recent Developments The following information highlights our significant developments since January 1, 2006 through the date of this filing. For additional information regarding the capital projects and acquisitions highlighted below, see “Capital Spending – Significant Recently Announced Growth Capital Projects” included within this Item 7. • In February 2007, Duncan Energy Partners L.P. (“Duncan Energy Partners”), a consolidated subsidiary of ours, completed an underwritten initial public offering of 14,950,000 of its common units. We formed Duncan Energy Partners as a Delaware limited partnership to acquire ownership interests in certain of our midstream energy businesses. For additional information regarding Duncan Energy Partners, see “Other Items – Initial Public Offering of Duncan Energy Partners” included within this Item 7. • In December 2006, we purchased all of the membership interests in Piceance Creek Pipeline, LLC (“Piceance Creek Pipeline”) from an affiliate of the EnCana Corporation (“EnCana”) for $100 million. The assets of Piceance Creek Pipeline consist primarily of a recently constructed 48-mile natural gas gathering pipeline (the “Piceance Creek Gathering System”) located in the Piceance Basin of northwest Colorado. This pipeline will connect to our Meeker natural gas processing plant, which is currently under construction. • In December 2006, Standard & Poor’s raised its credit rating of our Operating Partnership from BB+ to BBB-, which is investment grade, with a stable outlook. As a result of this change, all of the senior unsecured credit ratings of our Operating Partnership are currently at an investment grade level. • In November 2006, we entered into a 30-year agreement with an affiliate of Exxon Mobil Corporation (“ExxonMobil”), to provide gathering, compression, treating and conditioning services for natural gas produced as part of a development program planned by ExxonMobil in the Piceance Basin in Colorado. Under the terms of the agreement, ExxonMobil’s natural gas production from its Piceance Development Project, which encompasses more than 29,000 acres in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, will be dedicated to us. The fee-based agreement 53 Table of Contents includes an option for us to recover NGLs beyond those extracted to condition the gas to meet downstream pipeline specifications. To provide these services, we expect to invest approximately $185 million to construct new plant and pipeline facilities to compress the natural gas, treat it to remove impurities, extract NGLs, and deliver gas to the various pipeline transmission systems that serve the region. Construction of the facilities will begin after the receipt of the necessary permits and approvals and is expected to be completed in late 2008. • In November 2006, we announced an expansion of our Texas Intrastate Pipeline with the construction of a 178-mile pipeline (the “Sherman Extension”) that will transport up to 1.1 Bcf/d of natural gas from the growing Barnett Shale area of North Texas. This new pipeline is expected to cost $424.6 million, most of which will be spent in 2008, and be placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2008. • In October 2006, we signed definitive agreements with producers to construct, own and operate an offshore oil pipeline that will provide firm gathering services from the Shenzi production field located in the Southern Green Canyon area of the central Gulf of Mexico. • In September 2006, we sold 12,650,000 of our common units in an underwritten public offering, which generated net proceeds of approximately $320.8 million. • During the third quarter of 2006, the Operating Partnership sold $550 million in principal amount of fixed/floating unsecured junior subordinated notes due 2066 (the “Junior Subordinated Notes A”). For additional information regarding this issuance of debt, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Debt Obligations” included within this Item 7. • In August 2006, we became a joint venture partner with TEPPCO involving its Jonah Gas Gathering Company (“Jonah”). Jonah owns the Jonah Gathering System, located in the Greater Green River Basin of southwestern Wyoming. The Jonah Gathering System gathers and transports natural gas produced from the Jonah and Pinedale fields to regional natural gas processing plants, including our Pioneer plant, and major interstate pipelines that deliver natural gas to end-use markets. As part of this new joint venture, we and TEPPCO are significantly expanding the Jonah Gathering System (the Phase V expansion project). • In August 2006, we purchased a 220-mile NGL pipeline extending from Corpus Christi, Texas to Pasadena, Texas from ExxonMobil Pipeline Company. The total purchase price for this asset was $97.7 million in cash. This pipeline (in combination with others to be constructed or acquired) will be used to transport NGLs from our South Texas natural gas processing plants to our Mont Belvieu fractionation facilities. Duncan Energy Partners acquired an indirect 66% interest in this pipeline asset on February 5, 2007. • In August 2006, our wholly owned subsidiary, Mid-America Pipeline Company LLC (“Mid-America”), executed new long-term transportation agreements with all but one of its current shippers on its Rocky Mountain pipeline pursuant to terms and conditions of Mid-America’s open season tariff that was accepted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission effective August 6, 2006. Under the terms of the new agreements, shippers have committed to transport all of their current and future NGL production from the Rocky Mountains through the Mid-America Pipeline System to either our Hobbs fractionator (expected to be operational by mid-2007) or to Mont Belvieu, Texas via our Seminole Pipeline for a minimum of 10 years and up to a maximum of 20 years. Based on shipper production forecasts and current NGL extraction rates, we expect that these new agreements will fully utilize our Mid-America Pipeline System, including the 50 MBPD Phase I Expansion expected to be placed in-service during the third quarter of 2007. • In July 2006, we signed long-term agreements with CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (“CenterPoint Energy”) to provide firm natural gas transportation and storage services to its 54 Table of Contents natural gas utility, primarily in the Houston, Texas metropolitan area. We will provide CenterPoint Energy with an estimated 14 Bcf per year of natural gas beginning in April 2007. Our deliveries to CenterPoint Energy through these new contracts will mark the first time that we have had the opportunity to serve the growing Houston area natural gas market. We are already the primary natural gas service provider to the San Antonio and Austin, Texas markets. • In July 2006, we acquired the Encinal and Canales natural gas gathering systems and their related gathering and processing contracts and other amounts that comprised the South Texas natural gas transportation and processing business of Cerrito Gathering Company, Ltd., an affiliate of Lewis Energy Group, L.P. (“Lewis”). The aggregate value of total consideration we paid or issued to complete this business combination (referred to as the “Encinal acquisition”) was $326.3 million, which includes $145.2 million in cash paid to Lewis and the issuance of 7,115,844 of our common units to Lewis. • In April 2006, we announced plans to expand our Houston Ship Channel NGL import and export facility and related pipeline and other assets to accommodate an expected increase in throughput volumes. • In March 2006, we purchased the Pioneer natural gas processing plant and certain related natural gas processing rights from TEPPCO for $38.2 million in cash. • In March 2006, we announced plans to expand our petrochemical assets located in southeast Texas. The plans include the construction of a new propylene fractionator at our Mont Belvieu, Texas facility and the expansion of two refinery grade propylene pipelines. • In March 2006, we sold 18,400,000 of our common units in a public offering, which generated net proceeds of approximately $430 million. • In January 2006, we announced the execution of a minimum 15-year natural gas processing agreement with an affiliate of EnCana. Under this agreement, we have the right to process up to 1.3 Bcf/d of EnCana’s natural gas production from the Piceance Basin area of western Colorado. To accommodate this production, we began construction of the Meeker natural gas processing facility in Rio Blanco County, Colorado. In addition, we will construct a 50-mile NGL pipeline that will connect our Meeker processing facility to our Mid-America Pipeline System. Capital Spending We are committed to the long-term growth and viability of Enterprise Products Partners. Part of our business strategy involves expansion through business combinations, growth capital projects and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are positioned to continue to grow our system of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected future production increases from such areas as the Piceance Basin of western Colorado, the Greater Green River Basin in Wyoming, Barnett Shale in North Texas, and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Management continues to analyze potential acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. In recent years, major oil and gas companies have sold non-strategic assets in the midstream energy sector in which we operate. We forecast that this trend will continue, and expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestitures. Based on information currently available, we estimate our consolidated capital spending for 2007 will approximate $1.9 billion, which includes estimated expenditures of $1.7 billion for growth capital projects and acquisitions and $0.2 million for sustaining capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Our forecast of consolidated capital expenditures is based on our strategic operating and growth plans, which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or from other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, issuance of equity, and potential divestitures of certain assets to third and/or related parties. Our forecast of capital expenditures may change due to factors beyond our control, such as weather related issues, changes in supplier prices or adverse economic conditions. Furthermore, our forecast may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include acquisitions or decisions to take on additional partners. Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a principal factor that determines how much we can spend. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future operating growth needs, and although we currently intend to make the forecasted expenditures discussed above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital markets. The following table summarizes our capital spending by activity for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Capital spending for business combinations and asset purchases: GulfTerra Merger: Cash payments to El Paso, including amounts paid to acquire certain South Texas midstream assets $ 655,277 Transaction fees and other direct costs 24,032 Cash received from GulfTerra (40,313 ) Net cash payments 638,996 Value of non-cash consideration issued or granted 2,910,771 Total GulfTerra Merger consideration 3,549,767 Encinal acquisition, including non-cash equity consideration $ 326,309 $ — — Piceance Creek acquisition 100,000 — — NGL underground storage and terminalling assets purchased from Ferrellgas — 145,522 — Indirect interests in the Indian Springs natural gas gathering and processing assets — 74,854 — Additional ownership interests in Dixie Pipeline Company (“Dixie”) 12,913 68,608 — Additional ownership interests in Mid-America and Seminole pipeline systems — 25,000 — Other business combinations and asset purchases 18,390 12,618 85,851 Total 457,612 326,602 3,635,618 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment: Growth capital projects, net 1,148,123 719,372 113,759 Sustaining capital projects 132,455 98,077 33,169 Total 1,280,578 817,449 146,928 Capital spending attributable to unconsolidated affiliates: Investment in and advances to Jonah Gas Gathering Company 120,132 Other investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 7,290 88,044 64,412 Total 127,422 88,044 64,412 Total capital spending $ 1,865,612 $ 1,232,095 $ 3,846,958 Our capital spending for growth capital projects (as presented in the preceding table) are net of amounts we received from third parties as contributions in aid of our construction costs. Such contributions were $60.5 million, $47.0 million and $8.9 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. On certain of our capital projects, third parties are obligated to reimburse us for all or a portion of project expenditures. The majority of such arrangements are associated with projects related to pipeline construction and production well tie-ins. At December 31, 2006, we had $239.0 million in outstanding purchase commitments. These commitments primarily relate to growth capital projects in the Rocky Mountains that are expected to be 56 Table of Contents placed in service in 2007 and the Shenzi Oil Export Pipeline Project (see below), which is expected to be completed in 2009. Significant Recently Announced Growth Capital Projects The following information summarizes our significant growth capital projects as of February 15, 2007. The capital spending amount noted for each project includes accrued expenditures and capitalized interest through December 31, 2006. The forecast amount noted for each project includes a provision for estimated capitalized interest. Piceance Creek Acquisition. In December 2006, we purchased all of the membership interests in Piceance Creek from an affiliate of EnCana for $100 million. The assets of Piceance Creek consist primarily of the Piceance Creek Gathering System. As part of the transaction, EnCana signed a long-term, fixed-fee gathering contract and dedicated significant production to the system for the life of the associated lease holdings. The new Piceance Creek Gathering System has a transportation capacity of 1.6 Bcf/d and extends from a connection with EnCana’s Great Divide Gathering System near Parachute, Colorado, northward through the Piceance Basin to our Meeker gas treating and processing complex, which is under construction. The Piceance Creek Gathering System commenced operations in January 2007. Current natural gas production from the Piceance Basin, which covers approximately 6,000 square miles, exceeds 1 Bcf/d from more than 4,800 wells and has been growing at an annualized rate averaging 25% over the past five years. With third party estimates suggesting 20 trillion cubic feet of undeveloped reserves, the Piceance Basin offers long-term opportunities for us to continue to expand our system to serve producers developing this extensive resource play. Barnett Shale Natural Gas Pipeline Project. In November 2006, we announced an expansion of our Texas Intrastate Pipeline with the construction of the Sherman Extension that will transport up to 1.1 Bcf/d of natural gas from the growing Barnett Shale area of North Texas. The Sherman Extension is supported by long-term contracts with Devon Energy Corporation, the largest producer in the Barnett Shale area, and significant indications of interest from leading producers and gatherers in the Fort Worth basin, as well as other shippers on our Texas Intrastate Pipeline system. At its terminus, the new pipeline system will make deliveries into Boardwalk Pipeline Partners L.P.’s (“Boardwalk”) Gulf Crossing Expansion Project, which will provide export capacity for Barnett Shale natural gas production to multiple delivery points in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama that offer access to attractive markets in the Northeast and Southeast United States. In addition, the Sherman Extension will provide natural gas producers in East Texas and the Waha area of West Texas with access to these higher value markets through our Texas Intrastate Pipeline system. The Sherman Extension will originate near Morgan Mill, Texas and extend through the center of the current Barnett Shale development area to Sherman, Texas. This new pipeline is expected to cost $424.6 million, most of which will be spent in 2008, and be placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, we have the option to acquire up to a 49% interest in Gulf Crossing Expansion Project from Boardwalk, subject to certain conditions. The Barnett Shale is considered to be one of the largest unconventional natural gas resource plays in North America, covering approximately 14 counties and over seven million acres in the Fort Worth basin in North Texas. Current natural gas production is estimated at 2 Bcf/d from approximately 5,500 wells. Approximately 130 rigs are currently estimated to be working to develop Barnett Shale acreage in the region. According to the United States Geological Survey, the Barnett Shale has the resource potential of approximately 26 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Shenzi Oil Export Pipeline Project. In October 2006, we announced the execution of definitive agreements with producers to construct, own and operate an oil export pipeline that will provide firm gathering services from the BHP Billiton Plc-operated Shenzi production field located in the South Green Canyon area of the central Gulf of Mexico. The estimated construction cost of this new pipeline is 57 Table of Contents approximately $172.4 million. As of December 31, 2006, our capital spending with respect to the Shenzi oil pipeline project was $6.8 million. The Shenzi oil export pipeline will originate at the Shenzi Field, located in 4,300 feet of water at Green Canyon Block 653, approximately 120 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The 83-mile, 20-inch diameter pipeline will have the capacity to transport up to 230 MBPD of crude oil and will connect the Shenzi Field to our Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline and Poseidon Oil Pipeline System at our Ship Shoal 332B junction platform. We own a 50% interest in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline and a 36% interest in the Poseidon Oil Pipeline System and operate both pipelines. The Shenzi oil export pipeline will connect to a platform being constructed by BHP Billiton Plc to develop the Shenzi Field, which is expected to begin production in mid-2009. Jonah Joint Venture with TEPPCO and the Phase V Expansion. In August 2006, we became a joint venture partner with TEPPCO in its Jonah subsidiary, which owns the Jonah Gathering System, located in the Greater Green River Basin of southwestern Wyoming. The Jonah Gathering System currently gathers and transports approximately 1.5 Bcf/d (or 85%) of natural gas produced from over 1,100 wells in the Jonah and Pinedale fields to regional natural gas processing plants, including our Pioneer plant, and major interstate pipelines that deliver natural gas to end-use markets. Prior to entering into the Jonah joint venture, we managed the construction of the Phase V expansion and funded the initial construction costs under a letter of intent we entered into in February 2006. In connection with the joint venture arrangement, we and TEPPCO plan to continue the Phase V expansion, which is expected to increase the capacity of the Jonah Gathering System from 1.5 Bcf/d to 2.3 Bcf/d and to significantly reduce system operating pressures, which is anticipated to lead to increased production rates and ultimate reserve recoveries. The first portion of the expansion, which is expected to increase the system gathering capacity to 2.0 Bcf/d, is projected to be completed in the first quarter of 2007 at an estimated cost of approximately $302.0 million. The second portion of the Phase V expansion is expected to cost approximately $142.0 million and be completed by the end of 2007. As of December 31, 2006, capital spending with respect to the overall Phase V Expansion (on a 100% basis) was $233.7 million. We will continue to manage the Phase V construction project. TEPPCO was entitled to all distributions from the joint venture until specified milestones were achieved, at which point, we became entitled to receive 50% of the incremental cash flow from portions of the system placed in service as part of the expansion. After subsequent milestones are achieved, we and TEPPCO will share distributions based on a formula that takes into account the respective capital contributions of the parties, including expenditures by TEPPCO prior to the expansion. From August 1, 2006, we and TEPPCO share equally in the construction costs of the Phase V expansion. As of December 31, 2006, TEPPCO reimbursed us $109.4 million for 50% of the Phase V expansion cost incurred through November 29, 2006 (including carrying costs of $1.3 million). We had a receivable of $8.7 million from TEPPCO at December 31, 2006 for costs incurred through December 31, 2006. Upon completion of the expansion project and based on the formula in the joint venture partnership agreement, we expect to own an interest in Jonah of approximately 20%, with TEPPCO owning the remaining 80%. We will operate the system. See Item 13 of this annual report for additional information regarding our relationship with TEPPCO. DEP South Texas NGL Pipeline System. In August 2006, we acquired a 220-mile pipeline from ExxonMobil Pipeline Company for $97.7 million in cash. This pipeline originates in Corpus Christi, Texas and extends to Pasadena, Texas. This pipeline segment was expanded (the “Phase I expansion”) by (i) the construction of 45 miles of pipeline laterals to connect the system to our Armstrong and Shoup NGL fractionation facilities; (ii) the short-term lease from TEPPCO of a 11-mile interconnecting pipeline extending from Pasadena, Texas to Baytown, Texas; and (iii) the purchase of an additional 10-mile pipeline from TEPPCO that will connect the leased TEPPCO pipeline to Mont Belvieu, Texas. The purchase of the 10-mile segment from TEPPCO cost $8.0 million and was completed in January 2007. The primary term of the TEPPCO pipeline lease will expire in September 2007, and will continue on a month-to-month basis 58 Table of Contents subject to customary termination provisions. Collectively, this 286-mile pipeline system will be termed the DEP South Texas NGL Pipeline. Phase I of the DEP South Texas NGL Pipeline System commenced transportation of NGLs in January 2007. During 2007, we will construct an additional 21 miles of pipeline (the “Phase II upgrade”) to replace (i) the 11-mile pipeline we lease from TEPPCO and (ii) certain segments of the pipeline we acquired in August 2006 from ExxonMobil Pipeline Company. The Phase II upgrade is expected to provide a significant increase in pipeline capacity and be operational during the third quarter of 2007. We estimate the cost of the Phase I expansion was $37.7 million, which included the $8 million we paid TEPPCO to acquire its 10-mile Baytown to Mont Belvieu pipeline. We expect the Phase II upgrade to cost an additional $28.6 million. As of December 31, 2006, our capital spending with respect to the DEP South Texas NGL Pipeline System was $117.8 million, which includes the $97.7 million we paid in August 2006. This pipeline system is owned by South Texas NGL Pipelines, LLC, an entity that is 66% owned by Duncan Energy Partners and 34% by our Operating Partnership. For additional information regarding Duncan Energy Partners, see “Other Items – Initial Public Offering of Duncan Energy Partners” included within this Item 7. Texas Intrastate Pipeline Expansion Projects. In July 2006, we signed long-term agreements with CenterPoint Energy to provide firm natural gas transportation and storage services to its one of its natural gas utilities, primarily in the Houston, Texas metropolitan area. We will provide CenterPoint Energy with an estimated 14 Bcf per year of natural gas beginning in April 2007. To provide these new services, we will enhance our Texas Intrastate natural gas pipeline system through a combination of pipeline and compression projects, including the expansion of our Wilson natural gas storage facility in Texas, acquisition of certain pipeline laterals located in the Houston, Texas area and the construction of eleven new city gate delivery stations. The total capital cost of these projects is estimated to be $112.2 million and will be completed in phases extending through 2008. As of December 31, 2006, our capital spending with respect to these natural gas pipeline projects was $13.7 million. As part of this expansion project, we purchased certain idle pipeline assets in the Houston, Texas area from TEPPCO for $11.7 million in cash in October 2006. Encinal Acquisition. In July 2006, we acquired the Encinal and Canales natural gas gathering systems and related gathering and processing contracts and other assets that comprised the South Texas natural gas transportation and processing business of Lewis. The aggregate value of total consideration we paid or issued to complete this business combination, referred to as the Encinal acquisition, was $326.3 million. The Encinal and Canales gathering systems are located in South Texas and are connected to over 1,450 natural gas production wells producing from the Olmos and Wilcox formations. The Encinal system consists of 452 miles of pipeline, which is comprised of 280 miles of pipeline we acquired from Lewis in this transaction and 172 miles of pipeline that we own and had previously leased to Lewis. The Canales gathering system is comprised of 32 miles of pipeline. Currently, natural gas volumes gathered by the Encinal and Canales systems are transported by our existing South Texas natural gas pipeline system and are processed by our South Texas natural gas processing plants. As part of this transaction, we acquired long-term natural gas processing and gathering dedications from Lewis. First, these gathering systems will be supported by a life of reserves gathering and processing dedication by Lewis related to its natural gas production from the Olmos formation. Second, Lewis entered into a 10-year agreement with us for the transportation of natural gas treated at its proposed Big Reef facility. This facility will treat natural gas production from the southern portion of the Edwards Trend in South Texas. Third, Lewis entered into a 10-year agreement with us for the gathering and processing of rich gas it produces from below the Olmos formation. 59 Table of Contents The total consideration paid or granted for the Encinal acquisition is summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands): Cash payment to Lewis $ 145,197 Fair value of our 7,115,844 common units issued to Lewis 181,112 Total consideration $ 326,309 See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for our preliminary purchase price allocation related to this acquisition. As a result of our preliminary purchase price allocation, we recorded goodwill of $95.2 million, which management attributes to potential future benefits we may realize from our existing South Texas processing and NGL businesses as a result of the Encinal acquisition. Specifically, the long-term dedication rights acquired in connection with the Encinal acquisition are expected to add value to our South Texas processing facilities and related NGL businesses due to increased volumes. Expansion of Import and Export Capability. In April 2006, we announced an expansion of our NGL import and export terminal located on the Houston Ship Channel. This expansion project will increase offloading capability of our import facility from a maximum peak operating rate of 240 MBPD to 480 MBPD and the maximum loading rate of our export facility from 140 MBPD to 160 MBPD. As part of this expansion project, we will increase the transportation and processing capacities of certain of our assets that serve the terminal in order to accommodate the expected increase in import volumes. This expansion project is expected to cost approximately $62.7 million and be completed in the second quarter of 2007. As of December 31, 2006, our capital spending with respect to the expansion of import and export capabilities was $5.8 million. Wyoming Gas Processing Projects. In March 2006, we paid $38.2 million to TEPPCO for its Pioneer natural gas processing plant located in Opal, Wyoming and certain natural gas processing rights related to production from the Jonah and Pinedale fields located in the Greater Green River Basin in Wyoming. After completing this asset purchase, we increased the capacity of the Pioneer natural gas processing plant from 300 MMcf/d to 600 MMcf/d at an additional cost of approximately $21 million. This expansion was completed in July 2006 and enables us to process natural gas production from the Jonah and Pinedale fields that will be transported to our Wyoming facilities as a result of the processing contract rights we acquired from TEPPCO. Of the $38.2 million we paid TEPPCO to acquire the Pioneer facility, $37.8 million was allocated to the contract rights we acquired. In addition, to handle future production growth in the region and substantially increase NGL recoveries, we started construction of a new cryogenic natural gas processing plant in July 2006 adjacent to the Pioneer plant we acquired from TEPPCO. We expect our new natural gas processing plant, which will have the capacity to process up to 750 MMcf/d of natural gas, to be placed in service by the fourth quarter of 2007 at an expected cost of $236.2 million. As of December 31, 2006, our capital spending with respect to the new natural gas processing plant was $53.7 million. Expansion of Mont Belvieu Petrochemical Assets. In March 2006, we announced an expansion of our petrochemical assets in Mont Belvieu and southeast Texas. This expansion project includes (i) the construction of a fourth propylene fractionator at our Mont Belvieu complex, which will increase our propylene/propane fractionation capacity by approximately 15 MBPD, and (ii) the expansion of two refinery grade propylene gathering pipelines which will add 50 MBPD of gathering capacity into Mont Belvieu. These projects are expected to be completed by late 2007 and cost approximately $204.1 million, which includes $35.0 million we spent in December 2005 to acquire a related pipeline asset. As of December 31, 2006, our capital spending with respect to these expansion projects was $142.8 million. Piceance Basin Gas Processing Project. In January 2006, we announced the execution of a minimum 15-year natural gas processing agreement with an affiliate of EnCana. Under that agreement, we 60 Table of Contents have the right to process up to 1.3 Bcf/d of EnCana’s natural gas production from the Piceance Basin area of western Colorado. To accommodate this production, we have begun construction of the Meeker natural gas processing facility in Rio Blanco County, Colorado. This processing plant will provide us with 750 MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and the ability to recover up to 35 MBPD of NGLs at full rates when Phase I of construction is completed in mid-2007. In addition, we will construct an approximate 50-mile NGL pipeline that will connect our Meeker facility with our Mid-America Pipeline System. The estimated cost of Phase I of the Meeker facility and related NGL pipeline is $320.7 million. EnCana has certain guaranteed payment obligations to us and we are currently working to secure production dedications from additional producers. In June 2006, EnCana executed an option which requires us to build a 750 MMcf/d expansion of the Meeker facility by mid-2008 (the “Phase II” expansion). We have initiated design work on this expansion, which is expected to cost $260.6 million. This expansion will enable us to recover an additional 35 MBPD of NGLs at full rates. Under the terms of the agreement, EnCana has certain additional guaranteed payment obligations to us associated with the Phase II expansion. As of December 31, 2006, our capital spending with respect to our Piceance Basin gas processing projects was $137.4 million. Hobbs NGL Fractionator. In June 2005, we announced plans to construct a new NGL fractionator, designed to handle up to 75 MBPD of mixed NGLs, located at the interconnection of our Mid-America Pipeline System and our Seminole Pipeline near Hobbs, New Mexico. This project is expected to cost $232.5 million and be placed in service during the third quarter of 2007. Our Hobbs NGL fractionator will process the increase in mixed NGLs resulting from our Phase I expansion of the Mid-America Pipeline System. As of December 31, 2006, our capital spending with respect to the Hobbs NGL fractionator was $110.4 million. Mid-America Pipeline System Projects. In January 2005, we announced an expansion (the Phase I expansion) of the Rocky Mountain segment of our Mid-America Pipeline System to accommodate expected increases in mixed NGL shipments originating from producing basins in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico. The Phase I expansion project will be completed in stages and will increase throughput volumes on the Rocky Mountain segment by 50 MBPD. We expect final completion of the Phase I expansion during the third quarter of 2007 at a cost of approximately $202.6 million. As of December 31, 2006, our capital spending with respect to the Phase I expansion project was $128.6 million, including accrued expenditures. In August 2006, we executed new long-term transportation agreements with all but one of our current shippers on the Rocky Mountain segment of the Mid-America Pipeline System that will fully utilize this additional capacity. In June 2005, we began engineering and design work to construct a 190-mile, 12-inch NGL pipeline that will have the capacity to move up to 67 MBPD of mixed NGLs bi-directionally between Skellytown, Texas and Conway, Kansas and an additional 48 MBPD from Skellytown, Texas to Hobbs, New Mexico. Construction of this pipeline began in the spring of 2006 and is expected to cost approximately $83.6 million and be placed in service in April 2007. As of December 31, 2006, our capital spending with respect to the Skellytown to Conway pipeline was $62.5 million. Independence Hub Platform and Independence Trail Pipeline System. In November 2004, we entered into an agreement with the Atwater Valley Producers Group for the dedication, processing and gathering of natural gas and condensate production from several natural gas fields in the Atwater Valley, DeSoto Canyon, Lloyd Ridge and Mississippi Canyon areas (collectively, the “anchor fields”) of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. First production is expected in the second half of 2007. We constructed and own an 80% interest in the Independence Hub platform, which will be located in Mississippi Canyon Block 920, at a water depth of approximately 8,000 feet. The Independence Hub is 61 Table of Contents a 105-foot deep-draft, semi-submersible platform with a two-level production deck, which will process 1 Bcf/d of natural gas. In January 2007, the Independence Hub platform sailed from its construction site in Corpus Christi, Texas to Mississippi Canyon Block 920, where it will be installed. We expect mechanical completion of the platform by mid-March 2007. The platform, which is estimated to cost $445.9 million, will be operated by Anadarko (one of the major producers in the Atwater Valley Producers Group), and is designed to process production from its anchor fields and has excess payload capacity to support ten additional pipeline risers. As of December 31, 2006, our 80% share of capital spending with respect to the Independence Hub platform was $344.8 million. During the third quarter of 2006, we completed construction of our 134-mile Independence Trail natural gas pipeline system, which has a throughput capacity of 1 Bcf/d of natural gas and will transport production from our Independence Hub platform to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline. This pipeline system and a related junction platform (under construction) are estimated to cost $281.3 million. We own 100% of the Independence Trail pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, our capital spending with respect to the Independence Trail pipeline and related junction platform was $271.3 million, including accrued expenditures. Pipeline Integrity Costs Our NGL, petrochemical and natural gas pipelines are subject to pipeline safety programs administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation, through its Office of Pipeline Safety. This federal agency has issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines (which include NGL and petrochemical pipelines) and natural gas pipelines. In general, these regulations require companies to assess the condition of their pipelines in certain high consequence areas (as defined by the regulation) and to perform any necessary repairs. In connection with the regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines, we developed a pipeline integrity management program in 2002. In connection with the regulations for natural gas pipelines, we developed a pipeline integrity management program in 2004. We spent approximately $64.6 million to comply with these programs during 2006, of which $26.4 million was recorded as an operating expense and the remaining $38.2 million was capitalized. During 2005, we spent approximately $42.2 million to comply with these programs, of which $25.0 million was recorded as an operating expense, and the remaining $17.2 million was capitalized. We expect our net cash outlay for pipeline integrity program expenditures to approximate $48.0 million for 2007. Our forecast is net of certain costs we expect to recover from El Paso in connection with an indemnification agreement. In April 2002, GulfTerra acquired several midstream assets located in Texas and New Mexico from El Paso. These assets include the Texas Intrastate System and the Permian Basin System. El Paso agreed to indemnify GulfTerra for any pipeline integrity costs it incurred (whether paid or payable) during 2005, 2006 and 2007 with respect to such assets, to the extent that such annual costs exceed $3.3 million; however, the aggregate amount reimbursable by El Paso for these periods is capped at $50.2 million. In 2006, we recovered $13.7 million from El Paso related to our 2005 expenditures. During 2007, we expect to recover $29.1 million from El Paso related to our 2006 expenditures, which leaves a remainder of $7.3 million reimbursable by El Paso for 2007 pipeline integrity costs. 62 Table of Contents Results of Operations We have four reportable business segments: NGL Pipelines & Services, Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, Offshore Pipelines & Services and Petrochemical Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the type of services rendered (or technology employed) and products produced and/or sold. We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. Our non-GAAP financial measure of total segment gross operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP operating income. We define total (or consolidated) segment gross operating margin as operating income before depreciation, amortization and accretion expense; (ii) operating lease expenses for which we do not have the payment obligation; (iii) gains and losses on the sale of assets; and (iv) general and administrative expenses. Gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, provision for income taxes, minority interest, extraordinary charges and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses (net of the adjustments noted above) from segment revenues, with both segment totals before the elimination of intersegment and intrasegment transactions. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. We include earnings from equity method unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin and operating income. Our equity investments with industry partners are a vital component of our business strategy. They are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with those of our customers and/or suppliers. This method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand-alone basis. Many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations. As circumstances dictate, we may increase our ownership interest in equity investments, which could result in their subsequent consolidation into our operations. For additional information regarding our business segments, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 63 Table of Contents Selected Price and Volumetric Data The following table illustrates selected annual and quarterly industry index prices for natural gas, crude oil and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods presented.

The increase in consolidated revenues year-to-year is primarily due to higher sales volumes and energy commodity prices in 2006 relative to 2005. These factors accounted for a $1.7 billion increase in consolidated revenues associated with our marketing activities. Revenues for 2006 include $63.9 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Operating costs and expenses were $13.1 billion for 2006 versus $11.5 billion for 2005. The year-to-year increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses is primarily due to an increase in the cost of sales associated with our marketing activities. The cost of 65 Table of Contents sales of our NGL and petrochemical products increased $1.2 billion year-to-year as a result of an increase in volumes and higher energy commodity prices. Operating costs and expenses associated with our natural gas processing plants increased $258.7 million as a result of higher energy commodity prices in 2006 relative to 2005. General and administrative costs increased $1.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher costs associated with FERC rate case filings associated with our Mid-America Pipeline System and Texas Intrastate System. Changes in our revenues and costs and expenses year-to-year are explained in part by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $1.00 per gallon during 2006 versus $0.91 per gallon during 2005, a year-to-year increase of 10%. Our determination of the weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs is based on U.S. Gulf Coast prices for such products at Mont Belvieu, which is the primary industry hub for domestic NGL production. The market price of natural gas (as measured at Henry Hub) averaged $7.24 per MMBtu during 2006 versus $8.64 per MMBtu during 2005. Polymer grade and refinery grade propylene index prices increased 12% year-to-year. For additional historical energy commodity pricing information, see the table on page 64. Equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates were $21.6 million for 2006 compared to $14.5 million for 2005. An increase in volumes from offshore production led to a collective $11.8 million increase year-to-year in equity earnings from Poseidon and Deepwater Gateway. Equity earnings from Cameron Highway increased $4.9 million year-to-year. Our equity earnings for 2005 included an $11.5 million charge associated with the refinancing of Cameron Highway’s project finance debt. Also, equity earnings from our investment in Neptune decreased $10.3 million year-to-year primarily due to a $7.4 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in 2006 associated with this investment. Operating income for 2006 was $860.1 million compared to $663 million for 2005. Collectively, the aforementioned changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity earnings contributed to the $197.1 million increase in operating income year-to-year. Interest expense increased $7.5 million year-to-year primarily due to our issuance of junior notes in 2006 and an increase in interest rates charged on our variable rate debt. Our average debt principal outstanding was $4.9 billion in 2006 compared to $4.6 billion in 2005. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, our consolidated net income increased $181.6 million year-to-year to $601.2 million in 2006 compared to $419.5 million in 2005. Net income for both years includes the recognition of non-cash amounts related to the cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles. We recorded a $1.5 million benefit in 2006 and a $4.2 million charge in 2005 related to such changes. For additional information regarding the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles we recorded in 2006 and 2005, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $752.5 million for 2006 compared to $579.7 million for 2005. Segment gross operating margin for 2006 includes $40.4 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ivan. We collected $4.8 million of proceeds from business interruption claims in 2005 related to Hurricane Ivan. Strong demand for NGLs in 2006 compared to 2005 led to higher natural gas processing margins, increased volumes of natural gas processed under fee-based contracts and higher NGL throughput volumes at certain of our pipelines and fractionation facilities. Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and storage was $265.7 million for 2006 compared to $203.0 million for 2005. Total NGL transportation volumes increased to 1,577 MBPD during 2006 from 1,478 MBPD during 2005. The $62.7 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher NGL transportation and storage volumes at certain of our facilities and the affects of a higher average transportation rate charged to shippers on our Mid-America Pipeline System. Also, segment gross operating margin in 2006 from our Dixie pipeline system benefited from lower pipeline integrity 66 Table of Contents and maintenance costs year-to-year and the settlement of claims associated with a pipeline contamination incident in 2005. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business was $359.6 million for 2006 compared to $308.5 million for 2005. The $51.1 million increase in gross operating margin year-to-year is largely due to improved results from our south Texas and Louisiana natural gas processing facilities, which benefited from strong demand for NGLs, a favorable processing environment and higher levels of offshore natural gas production available for processing. Fee-based processing volumes increased to 2.2 Bcf/d during 2006 from 1.8 Bcf/d during 2005. Lastly, gross operating margin from natural gas processing for 2006 includes $9.6 million from processing contracts we acquired in connection with the Encinal acquisition in July 2006 and $9.4 million from the Pioneer plant, which we acquired from TEPPCO in March 2006 and subsequently expanded its capacity from 300 MMcf/d to 600 MMcf/d. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation was $86.8 million for 2006 compared to $63.4 million for 2005. Fractionation volumes increased from 292 MBPD during 2005 to 312 MBPD during 2006. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin of $23.4 million is largely due to increased fractionation volumes at our Norco NGL fractionator. This facility suffered a reduction of volumes in the second half of 2005 due to the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Also, our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionator benefited from a 15 MBPD expansion project that was completed during the second quarter of 2006. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $333.4 million for 2006 compared to $353.1 million for 2005. Our total onshore natural gas transportation volumes were 6,012 BBtu/d during 2006 compared to 5,916 BBtu/d for 2005. A $24.7 million increase in segment gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System year-to-year was more than offset by lower gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System and Wilson natural gas storage facility. Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System increased to $117.7 million for 2006 from $93 million for 2005. Our Texas Intrastate System benefited from higher transportation fees and lower operating costs year-to-year. Segment gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System decreased $26.7 million year-to-year attributable to lower revenues from certain gathering contracts in which the fees are based on an index price for natural gas. Average index prices for natural gas were significantly higher during 2005 relative to 2006 due to supply interruptions and higher regional demand caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Natural gas gathering volumes for the San Juan Gathering System were 1.2 BBtu/d for 2006 and 2005. In addition, gross operating margin from this segment decreased $21.9 million year-to-year as a result of mechanical problems associated with three storage caverns located at our Wilson natural gas storage facility in Texas, which caused these wells to be taken out of service for most of 2006. This includes $7.9 million in losses associated with the withdrawal of cushion gas from these wells. Lastly, gross operating margin for 2006 includes $1.8 million from the Encinal Gathering System that we acquired in July 2006. The Encinal Gathering System contributed 89 BBtu/d of gathering volumes during 2006. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $103.4 million for 2006 compared to $77.5 million for 2005. Segment gross operating margin for 2006 includes $23.5 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ivan. As a result of industry losses associated with these storms, insurance costs for offshore operations have increased dramatically. Insurance costs for our offshore assets were $21.6 million for 2006 compared to $6.5 million for 2005. 67 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our offshore crude oil pipelines was $23.0 million for 2006 versus $0.3 million for 2005. Our Marco Polo and Poseidon oil pipelines posted higher crude oil transportation volumes during 2006 due to increased production activity by our customers. Collectively, gross operating margin from the Marco Polo and Poseidon oil pipelines improved $10.1 million year-to-year. Our Constitution Oil Pipeline, which was placed in-service during the first quarter of 2006, contributed $8.8 million to segment gross operating margin during 2006. Total offshore crude oil transportation volumes were 153 MBPD during 2006 versus 127 MBPD during 2005. Gross operating margin from our offshore natural gas pipelines was $22.4 million for 2006 compared to $37.1 million for 2005. Offshore natural gas transportation volumes were 1,520 BBtu/d during 2006 versus 1,780 BBtu/d during the third quarter of 2005. The $14.7 million decrease in gross operating margin year-to-year is largely due to increased insurance costs and a non-cash impairment charge of $7.4 million recorded in 2006 associated with our investment in Neptune. Also, 2006 includes gross operating margin of $8.4 million and transportation volumes of 50 BBtu/d from the Constitution natural gas pipeline, which was placed in service during the first quarter of 2006. Gross operating margin from our offshore platforms was $34.5 million for 2006 compared to $40.1 million for 2005. The decrease in gross operating margin year-to-year is primarily due to reduced offshore production as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Equity earnings from Deepwater Gateway, which owns the Marco Polo platform, increased $7.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher processing volumes. Petrochemical Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $173.1 million for 2006 compared to $126.1 million for 2005. The $47 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to improved results from our octane enhancement business attributable to higher isooctane sales volumes and prices. Gross operating margin from this business was $36.5 million for 2006 compared to $3.6 million for the 2005. Isooctane, a high octane, low vapor pressure motor gasoline additive, complements the increasing use of ethanol, which has a high vapor pressure. Our isooctane production facility commenced operations in the second quarter of 2005. Gross operating margin from our propylene fractionation and pipeline activities was $63.4 million for 2006 versus $55.9 million for 2005. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin of $7.5 million is primarily due to improved polymer grade propylene sales prices and volumes and the addition of the Texas City refinery-grade propylene pipeline, which we completed during 2005. Petrochemical transportation volumes were 97 MBPD during 2006 compared to 64 MBPD during 2005. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization was $73.2 million for 2006 compared to $66.6 million for 2005. The year-to-year increase of $6.6 million is primarily due to higher processing fees and lower fuel costs. Butane isomerization volumes were 81 MBPD during 2006 and 2005. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2005 with Year Ended December 31, 2004 Revenues for 2005 were $12.3 billion compared to $8.3 billion for 2004. The increase in consolidated revenues is due in part to an increase in NGL and petrochemical sales volumes and higher energy commodity prices in 2005 relative to 2004. These differences accounted for a $2.4 billion increase in revenues from our natural gas, NGL and petrochemical marketing activities. Also, our consolidated revenues increased by $1.5 billion year-to-year attributable to revenues earned by acquired or consolidated businesses, particularly those generated by the GulfTerra and South Texas midstream assets. Operating costs and expenses were $11.5 billion for 2005 compared to $7.9 billion for 2004. The year-to-year increase in consolidated costs and expenses is primarily due to (i) higher energy commodity prices, which resulted in a $2.2 billion increase in the cost of sales of natural gas, NGLs and petrochemical products and (ii) the addition of $1.4 billion in costs and expenses attributable to acquired or consolidated businesses. General and administrative costs increased $15.6 million year-to-year as a result of our expanded business activities. 68 Table of Contents As noted previously, changes in our revenues and costs and expenses year-to-year are explained in part by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.91 per gallon during 2005 versus $0.73 per gallon during 2004 – a year-to-year increase of 25%. The Henry Hub market price for natural gas averaged $8.64 per MMBtu during 2005 versus $6.13 per MMBtu during 2004. Polymer grade propylene index prices increased 27% year-to-year and refinery grade propylene index prices increased 28% year-to-year. For additional historical energy commodity pricing information, see the table on page 64. Equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates were $14.5 million for 2005 versus $52.8 million for 2004. Equity earnings for 2005 include a full year of our share of earnings from investments we acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger, including an $11.5 million charge associated with the refinancing of Cameron Highway’s project debt. Fiscal 2004 includes $32.0 million of equity earnings from GulfTerra GP, which we consolidated in September 2004 as a result of completing the GulfTerra Merger. Operating income for 2005 was $663.0 million compared to $423.0 million for 2004. Collectively, the aforementioned changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity earnings contributed to the $240 million increase in operating income year-to-year. Interest expense increased $74.8 million year-to-year primarily due to debt that was incurred in 2004 as a result of the GulfTerra Merger and the issuance of additional senior notes in 2005. Our average debt principal outstanding was $4.6 billion in 2005 compared to $2.8 billion in 2004. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, our consolidated net income increased $151.2 million year-to-year to $419.5 million in 2005 compared to $268.3 million in 2004. Net income for both years includes the recognition of non-cash amounts related to the cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles. We recorded a $4.2 million charge in 2005 and a $10.8 million benefit in 2004 related to such changes. For additional information regarding the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles we recorded in 2005 and 2004, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $579.7 million for 2005 versus $374.2 million for 2004. The $205.5 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to assets we acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. Also, this business segment was impacted by the varying effects of Hurricanes Katrina (August 2005) and Rita (September 2005), both significant storms. In general, the disruptions in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production along the U.S. Gulf Coast resulted in decreased volumes for some of our pipeline systems, natural gas processing plants and NGL fractionators, which in turn caused a decrease in our gross operating margin from certain operations. In addition, operating costs at certain of our plants and pipelines were negatively impacted due to the higher fuel costs. These effects were mitigated by increases in gross operating margin from certain of our other operations, which benefited from increased demand for NGLs, regional demand for natural gas and a general increase in commodity prices. We collected $4.8 million of proceeds from business interruption claims in 2005 related to Hurricane Ivan. Segment gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business was $308.5 million for 2005 compared to $123.6 million for 2004. The $184.9 million year-to-year increase includes $122.3 million of gross operating margin from natural gas processing plants we acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased $66.9 million year-to-year due to higher sales volumes and energy commodity prices during 2005 relative to 2004. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation was $63.4 million for 2005 compared to $42.6 million for 2004. The $20.8 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin from NGL fractionation includes (i) $14.9 million of improved results from our Mont Belvieu facility, (ii) $14 million 69 Table of Contents from assets acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger and (iii) a $9.0 million decrease from our Louisiana NGL fractionators, particularly Norco, which suffered a loss of processing volumes due to Hurricane Katrina. Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and storage was $203.0 million for 2005 compared to $208.0 million for 2004. The $5.0 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and storage was due to a variety of reasons, including (i) a net $11.2 million decrease from our Mid-America Pipeline System and Seminole Pipeline primarily due to higher fuel costs and pipeline integrity expenses, (ii) a $4.9 million decrease from our Louisiana Pipeline System primarily due to hurricane effects, (iii) a net $6.9 million increase from our import and export facilities and related Houston Ship Channel pipeline attributable to increased volumes, and (iv) a net $8.9 million increase due to acquired assets and consolidation of former equity method investees. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $353.1 million for 2005 compared to $91.0 million for 2004. The $262.1 million increase in gross operating margin year-to-year is primarily due to onshore natural gas pipelines and storage assets acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. Gross operating margin from this segment is largely attributable to contributions from our San Juan Gathering System, Texas Intrastate System and Permian Basin System, which together generated gross operating margins of $290.4 million in 2005. Our Petal and Hattiesburg natural gas storage facilities generated $38.7 million of gross operating margin in 2005. The San Juan Gathering System, Texas Intrastate System, Permian Basin System and Petal and Hattiesburg natural gas storage facilities were acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $77.5 million for 2005 compared to $36.5 million for 2004. The $41.0 million increase in gross operating margin year-to-year is primarily due to offshore Gulf of Mexico assets acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. The year-to-year change in gross operating margin consists of the following: (i) a $20.1 million increase from offshore natural gas pipelines, (ii) a $26.4 million increase from offshore platforms and (iii) a $5.5 million decrease from offshore crude oil pipelines, which includes an $11.5 million charge related to the refinancing of Cameron Highway’s project debt in 2005. Petrochemical Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $126.1 million for 2005 compared to $121.5 million during 2004. The $4.6 million increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to improved results from our butane isomerization and octane enhancement businesses, both of which benefited from increased demand for motor gasoline in 2005. Other. Gross operating margin from this segment pertains to equity earnings we recorded from GulfTerra GP prior to its consolidation with our financial results in September 2004. Significant Risks and Uncertainties – Hurricanes EPCO renewed its property and casualty insurance programs during the second quarter of 2006. As a result of severe hurricanes such as Katrina and Rita that occurred in 2005, market conditions for obtaining property damage insurance coverage were difficult. Under our renewed insurance programs, coverage is more restrictive, including increased physical damage and business interruption deductibles. For example, our deductible for onshore physical damage increased from $2.5 million to $5 million per event and our deductible period for onshore business interruption claims increased from 30 days to 60 days. Additional restrictions will also be applied in the event of damage from named windstorms. In addition to changes in coverage, the cost of property damage insurance increased substantially from prior periods. At present, our annualized cost of insurance premiums for all lines of coverage is approximately $49.2 million, which represents a $28.1 million (or 133%) increase from our 2005 annualized insurance cost. The following is a discussion of the general status of insurance claims related to significant storm events that affected our assets in 2004 and 2005. To the extent we include estimates regarding the dollar 70 Table of Contents value of damages, please be aware that a change in our estimates may occur as additional information becomes available to us. Hurricane Ivan insurance claims. Our final purchase price allocation related to the merger of GulfTerra with a wholly owned subsidiary of Enterprise Products Partners in September 2004 (the “GulfTerra Merger”) included a $26.2 million receivable for insurance claims related to expenditures to repair property damage to certain pre-merger GulfTerra assets caused by Hurricane Ivan. During 2006, we received cash reimbursements from insurance carriers totaling $24.1 million related to these property damage claims, and we expect to recover the remaining $2.1 million in 2007. If the final recovery of funds is different than the amount previously expended, we will recognize an income impact at that time. In addition, we have submitted business interruption insurance claims for our estimated losses caused by Hurricane Ivan. During 2006, we received $17.4 million of nonrefundable cash proceeds from such claims. We are continuing our efforts to collect residual balances and expect to complete the process during 2007. To the extent we receive nonrefundable cash proceeds from business interruption insurance claims, they are recorded as a gain in our Statements of Consolidated Operations in the period of receipt. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita insurance claims. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, both significant storms, affected certain of our Gulf Coast assets in August and September of 2005, respectively. The majority of repairs to our facilities are completed; however, certain minor repairs are ongoing to two offshore pipelines and an onshore gas processing facility. To the extent that insurance proceeds from property damage claims are not probable of collection or do not cover our estimated expenditures (in excess of $5.0 million of insurance deductibles we expensed during 2005), such amounts are charged to earnings when realized. With respect to these storms, we have $78.2 million of estimated property damage claims outstanding at December 31, 2006, that we believe are probable of collection during the period 2007 through 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we received $10.5 million of physical damage proceeds related to such storms (dollars in thousands). In addition, we received $46.5 million of nonrefundable cash proceeds from business interruption claims during the year ended December 31, 2006. We are aggressively pursuing collection of our remaining property damage and business interruption claims related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The following table summarizes proceeds we received during 2006 from business interruption and property damage insurance claims with respect to certain named storms (dollars in thousands). Business interruption proceeds: Hurricane Ivan $ 17,382 Hurricane Katrina 24,500 Hurricane Rita 22,000 Total proceeds $ 63,882 Property damage proceeds: Hurricane Ivan $ 24,104 Hurricane Katrina 7,500 Hurricane Rita 3,000 Total proceeds $ 34,604 Total proceeds received during 2006 $ 98,486 During 2005, we received $4.8 million of nonrefundable cash proceeds from business interruption claims. 71 Table of Contents General Outlook for 2007 We are currently in a major asset construction phase that began in 2005. Fiscal 2007 will be a transition year as we take several major projects from the construction phase and place them in-service. In addition, we have continued to grow our relationships with customers by executing several long-term natural gas gathering and processing agreements with major producers to support our newly constructed assets. As we further expand our portfolio of midstream assets, we expect our results of operations to be affected by the following key trends and events during 2007. • We believe that drilling activity in the major producing areas where we operate, including the Gulf of Mexico and supply basins in Texas, San Juan and the Rocky Mountains, will result in increased demand for our midstream energy services. As a result, we expect higher transportation and processing volumes for our existing assets due to increased natural gas and crude oil production from both onshore and offshore producing areas. In addition, we expect to benefit from increased demand as new assets come on-line during 2007. • We expect to benefit from an increase in crude oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico as our Independence Hub platform and Independence Trail pipeline are placed in-service during the second half of 2007. Our Independence Hub platform and Independence Trail pipeline will benefit from initial natural gas production from dedicated production fields in the Atwater Valley, DeSoto Canyon, Lloyd Ridge and Mississippi Canyon areas of the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we believe that our Marco Polo Oil Pipeline and Marco Polo platform will continue to benefit as production volumes increase from developments in the Southern Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico. Increased production in the Gulf of Mexico will increase volumes of natural gas and NGLs available to our facilities in southern Louisiana. • We expect the volume of natural gas and NGLs available to our facilities in Texas to increase as a result of drilling activity and long-term agreements executed with new customers. We expect natural gas transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System to increase during 2007 as we begin to supply the Houston, Texas area with natural gas volumes under a long-term agreement with CenterPoint Energy. As a result of the Encinal acquisition, we expect to increase natural gas gathering and processing volumes in south Texas. In turn, this should increase our NGL production in south Texas. In addition, we will continue to expand our natural gas gathering assets in the Barnett shale region of north Texas. • We expect to benefit from increased natural gas and NGL volumes as several new assets are placed in-service throughout Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico. We expect our new Pioneer natural gas processing plant and expanded Jonah Gathering System to benefit from increased production in the Greater Green River basin of Wyoming. Production from the Piceance basin of western Colorado should benefit our Piceance Creek Gathering System and Meeker natural gas processing plant. We expect our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and Hobbs NGL fractionator to benefit from increased volumes of NGLs produced at the Pioneer and Meeker natural gas processing facilities. • We believe that the strength of the domestic and global economy will continue to drive increased demand for all forms of energy despite fluctuating commodity prices. Our largest NGL consuming customers in the ethylene industry continue to see strong demand for their products. Ethane and propane continue to be the preferred feedstocks for the ethylene industry with the high price of crude oil relative to natural gas. 72 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses and debt service, are for working capital, capital expenditures, business acquisitions and distributions to our partners. We expect to fund our short-term needs for such items as operating expenses and sustaining capital expenditures with operating cash flows and short-term revolving credit arrangements. Capital expenditures for long-term needs resulting from internal growth projects and business acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources (either separately or in combination) including cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under credit facilities, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities and proceeds from divestitures of ownership interest in assets to affiliates or third parties. We expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash flows. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and/or refinancing arrangements. At December 31, 2006, we had $22.6 million of unrestricted cash on hand and approximately $790.1 million of available credit under our Operating Partnership’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In total, we had approximately $5.3 billion in principal outstanding under various debt agreements at December 31, 2006. As a result of our growth objectives, we expect to access debt and equity capital markets from time-to-time and we believe that financing arrangements to support our growth activities can be obtained on reasonable terms. Furthermore, we believe that maintenance of an investment grade credit rating combined with continued ready access to debt and equity capital at reasonable rates and sufficient trade credit to operate our businesses efficiently provide a solid foundation to meet our long and short-term liquidity and capital resource requirements. For additional information regarding our growth strategy, see “Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. Registration Statements We may issue equity or debt securities to assist us in meeting our liquidity and capital spending requirements. Duncan Energy Partners may do likewise in meeting its liquidity and capital spending requirements. In March 2005, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the issuance of $4 billion of equity and debt securities. After taking into account the past issuance of securities under this universal registration statement, we can issue approximately $2.1 billion of additional securities under this registration statement as of February 1, 2007. Our significant issuances of partnership equity during the year ended December 31, 2006 were as follows: • In March 2006, we sold 18,400,000 common units (including an over-allotment amount of 2,400,000 common units) to the public at an offering price of $23.90 per unit. Net proceeds from this offering, including Enterprise Products GP’s proportionate net capital contribution of $8.6 million, were approximately $430 million after deducting applicable underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses of $18.3 million. The net proceeds from this offering, including Enterprise Products GP’s proportionate net capital contribution, were used to temporarily reduce indebtedness outstanding under our Operating Partnership’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. • In July 2006, we issued approximately 7.1 million of our common units in connection with the Encinal business acquisition. In August 2006, we filed a registration statement with the SEC for the resale of these common units. • In September 2006, we sold 12,650,000 common units (including an over-allotment amount of 1,650,000 common units) to the public at an offering price of $25.80 per unit. Net proceeds from this offering, including Enterprise Products GP’s proportionate net capital contribution of $6.4 73 Table of Contents million, were approximately $320.8 million after deducting applicable underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses of $11.8 million. Net proceeds of $260 million from this offering, including Enterprise Products GP’s proportionate net capital contribution, were used to temporarily reduce indebtedness outstanding under our Operating Partnership’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. The remaining net proceeds were used for general partnership purposes. During 2003, we instituted a distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”). The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they would otherwise receive into the purchase of additional common units. We have a registration statement on file with the SEC covering the issuance of up to 15,000,000 common units in connection with the DRIP. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we issued 3,639,949 common units in connection with our DRIP, which generated proceeds of $91.6 million from plan participants. These proceeds include $50 million reinvested by EPCO in August 2006 with respect to its beneficial ownership of our common units. A total of 1,966,354 common units were issued to EPCO as a result of this reinvestment in our partnership. We also have a registration statement on file related to our employee unit purchase plan, under which we can issue up to 1,200,000 common units. Under this plan, employees of EPCO can purchase our common units at a 10% discount through payroll deductions. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we issued 134,700 common units to employees under this plan, which generated proceeds of $3.4 million. In February 2007, Duncan Energy Partners completed its initial public offering of 14,950,000 common units, the majority of proceeds from which were distributed to us. Duncan Energy Partners may issue additional amounts of equity in the future in connection with other acquisitions. For additional information regarding Duncan Energy Partners, see “Other Items – Initial Public Offering of Duncan Energy Partners.” For information regarding our public debt obligations or partnership equity, see Notes 14 and 15, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Credit Ratings of Operating Partnership At February 27, 2007, the investment-grade credit ratings of our Operating Partnership’s debt securities were Baa3 by Moody’s Investor Services; BBB- by Fitch Ratings; and BBB- by Standard and Poor’s. All three ratings services have assigned to us a “stable outlook” with respect to their judgment of our future business performance. Based on the characteristics of the fixed/floating unsecured junior subordinated notes that the Operating Partnership issued during the third quarter of 2006, the rating agencies assigned partial equity treatment to the notes. Moody’s Investor Services and Standard and Poor’s each assigned 50% equity treatment and Fitch Ratings assigned 75% equity treatment. In connection with the construction of our Pascagoula, Mississippi natural gas processing plant, the Operating Partnership entered into a $54 million, ten-year, fixed-rate loan with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation (“MBFC”). The indenture agreement for this loan contains an acceleration clause whereby if the Operating Partnership’s credit rating by Moody’s declines below Baa3 in combination with our credit rating at Standard & Poor’s declining below BBB-, the $54.0 million principal balance of this loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest would become immediately due and payable 120 days following such event. If such an event occurred, we would have to either redeem the Pascagoula MBFC Loan or provide an alternative credit agreement to support our obligation under this loan. 74 Table of Contents Debt Obligations For detailed information regarding our consolidated debt obligations and those of our unconsolidated affiliates, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. The following table summarizes our consolidated debt obligations at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands): At December 31, 2006 2005 Operating Partnership senior debt obligations: Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility, variable rate, due October 2011 (1) $ 410,000 $ 490,000 Pascagoula MBFC Loan, 8.70% fixed-rate, due March 2010 54,000 54,000 Senior Notes B, 7.50% fixed-rate, due February 2011 450,000 450,000 Senior Notes C, 6.375% fixed-rate, due February 2013 350,000 350,000 Senior Notes D, 6.875% fixed-rate, due March 2033 500,000 500,000 Senior Notes E, 4.00% fixed-rate, due October 2007 500,000 500,000 Senior Notes F, 4.625% fixed-rate, due October 2009 500,000 500,000 Senior Notes G, 5.60% fixed-rate, due October 2014 650,000 650,000 Senior Notes H, 6.65% fixed-rate, due October 2034 350,000 350,000 Senior Notes I, 5.00% fixed-rate, due March 2015 250,000 250,000 Senior Notes J, 5.75% fixed-rate, due March 2035 250,000 250,000 Senior Notes K, 4.950% fixed-rate, due June 2010 500,000 500,000 Dixie Revolving Credit Facility, variable rate, due June 2010 (2) 10,000 17,000 Other, 8.75% fixed-rate, due June 2010 (5) 5,068 5,068 Total principal amount of senior debt obligations 4,779,068 4,866,068 Operating Partnership Junior Subordinated Notes A, due August 2066 550,000 — Total principal amount of senior and junior debt obligations 5,329,068 4,866,068 Other, including unamortized discounts and premiums and changes in fair value (3) (33,478 ) (32,287 ) Long-term debt(4) $ 5,295,590 $ 4,833,781 Standby letters of credit outstanding $ 49,858 $ 33,129 (1) In June 2006, the Operating Partnership executed a second amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the credit agreement governing its Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. The Second Amendment, among other things, extends the maturity date of amounts borrowed under the Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility from October 2010 to October 2011 with respect to $1.25 billion of the commitments. Borrowings with respect to the remaining $48 million in commitments mature in October 2010. (2) The maturity date of this facility was extended from June 2007 to June 2010 in August 2006. The other terms of the Dixie facility remain unchanged from those described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. In accordance with GAAP, we consolidated Dixie’s debt with that of our own; however, we are not obligated to make interest or debt payments with respects to Dixie’s debt. (3) The December 31, 2006 amount includes $29.1 million related to fair value hedges and a net $4.4 million in unamortized discounts and premiums. The December 31, 2005 amount includes $19.2 million related to fair value hedges and a net $13.1 million in unamortized discounts and premiums. (4) In accordance with SFAS 6, “Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to be Refinanced,” long-term and current maturities of debt reflects the classification of such obligations at December 31, 2006. With respect to Senior Notes E due in October 2007, the Operating Partnership has the ability to use available credit capacity under its Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility to fund the repayment of this debt. (5) Represents the remaining debt obligations assumed in connection with the GulfTerra merger. Issuance of Junior Subordinated Notes A. The Operating Partnership sold $550.0 million in principal amount of fixed/floating, unsecured, long-term subordinated notes due 2066 during the third quarter of 2006. The Operating Partnership used the proceeds from issuing this subordinated debt to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under its Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and for general partnership purposes. The Operating Partnership’s payment obligations under the Junior Subordinated Notes A are subordinated to all of its current and future senior indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture Agreement). We have guaranteed repayment of amounts due under the Junior Subordinated Notes A through an unsecured and subordinated guarantee. The indenture agreement governing the Junior Subordinated Notes A allows the Operating Partnership to defer interest payments on one or more occasions for up to ten consecutive years subject to certain conditions. The indenture agreement also provides that, unless (i) all deferred interest on the Junior 75 Table of Contents Subordinated Notes A has been paid in full as of the most recent interest payment date, (ii) no event of default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing and (iii) we are not in default of our obligations under related guarantee agreements, then the Operating Partnership and we cannot declare or make any distributions with respect to any of their respective equity securities or make any payments on indebtedness or other obligations that rank pari passu with or subordinate to the Junior Subordinated Notes A. The Junior Subordinated Notes A will bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 8.375% from July 2006 to August 2016, payable semi-annually in arrears in February and August of each year, commencing in February 2007. After August 2016, the Junior Subordinated Notes A will bear variable rate interest at an annual rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR rate for the related interest period plus 3.708%, payable quarterly in arrears in February, May, August and November of each year commencing in November 2016. Interest payments may be deferred on a cumulative basis for up to ten consecutive years, subject to the certain provisions. The Junior Subordinated Notes A mature in August 2066 and are not redeemable by the Operating Partnership prior to August 2016 without payment of a make-whole premium. In connection with the issuance of the Junior Subordinated Notes A, the Operating Partnership entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant in favor of the covered debt holders (as named therein) pursuant to which the Operating Partnership agreed for the benefit of such debt holders that it would not redeem or repurchase such junior subordinated notes unless such redemption or repurchase is made from the proceeds of issuance of certain securities. Based on the characteristics of the Junior Subordinated Notes A, rating agencies assigned partial equity treatment to the notes. Moody’s Investor Services and Standard and Poor’s each assigned 50% equity treatment and Fitch Ratings assigned 75% equity treatment. Debt obligations of unconsolidated affiliates. The following table summarizes the debt obligations of our unconsolidated affiliates (on a 100% basis to the joint venture) at December 31, 2006 and our ownership interest in each entity on that date (dollars in thousands): Our Ownership Interest Total Cameron Highway 50.0 % $ 415,000 Poseidon 36.0 % 91,000 Evangeline 49.5 % 25,650 Total $ 531,650 In March 2006, Cameron Highway amended the note purchase agreement governing its senior secured notes to primarily address the effect of reduced deliveries of crude oil to Cameron Highway resulting from production delays caused by the lingering effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In general, this amendment modified certain financial covenants in light of production forecasts. In addition, the amendment increased the letters of credit required to be issued by the Operating Partnership and an affiliate of our joint venture partner from $18.4 million each to $36.8 million each. In September 2006, Fitch Ratings reaffirmed its BBB- rating (with a negative outlook) of Cameron Highway’s privately placed senior secured notes. The rating was placed on watch in March 2006 due to the near-term financial impact of lower than anticipated volumes on the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline. While Fitch continues to believe that the current volume shortfalls are temporary, particularly with completion of the Atlantis development expected in the first quarter of 2007, if transportation volumes remain impaired over the next several months Fitch will likely lower the rating. Currently, production from Atlantis is expected to commence by the end of 2007. If the rating falls below BBB-, the interest rates paid by Cameron Highway will increase by 1% to 1.5% per annum depending on the lower rating. In May 2006, Poseidon amended its revolving credit facility, which, among other things, decreased the availability to $150.0 million from $170.0 million, extended the maturity date from January 2008 to May 2011 and lowered the borrowing rate. 76 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands). For information regarding the individual components of our cash flow amounts, see the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Item 8 of this annual report. For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 1,175,069 $ 631,708 $ 391,541 Net cash used in investing activities 1,689,288 1,130,395 941,424 Net cash provided by financing activities 494,972 516,229 543,973 Net cash flows provided by operating activities is largely dependent on earnings from our business activities. As a result, these cash flows are exposed to certain risks. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry. We provide services for producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. The products that we process, sell or transport are principally used as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating; feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing; and in the production of motor gasoline. Reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers, whether because of general economic conditions, reduced demand for the end products made with our products or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons could have a negative impact on our earnings and thus the availability of cash from operating activities. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Item 1A of this annual report. Cash used in investing activities primarily represents expenditures for capital projects, business combinations, asset purchases and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Cash provided by (or used in) financing activities generally consists of borrowings and repayments of debt, distributions to partners and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities. Amounts presented in our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for borrowings and repayments under debt agreements are influenced by the magnitude of cash receipts and payments under our revolving credit facilities. Our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method. The indirect method derives net cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income to remove (i) the effects of all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments, such as changes during the period in inventory, deferred income and similar transactions, (ii) the effects of all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and cash payments, such as changes during the period in receivables and payables, (iii) the effects of all items classified as investing or financing cash flows, such as gains or losses on sale of property, plant and equipment or extinguishment of debt, and (iv) other non-cash amounts such as depreciation, amortization, operating lease expense paid by EPCO and changes in the fair market value of financial instruments. Equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates is also a non-cash item that must be removed in determining net cash provided by operating activities. Our cash flows from operating activities reflect the actual cash distributions we receive from such investees. In general, the net effect of changes in operating accounts results from the timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for purchases and other expenses during each period. Increases or decreases in inventory are influenced by the quantity of products held in connection with our marketing activities and changes in energy commodity prices. The following information highlights the significant year-to-year variances in our cash flow amounts: 77 Table of Contents Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2006 with Year Ended December 31, 2005 Operating activities. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $543.4 million over that recorded for the year ended December 31, 2005. In addition to changes in our earnings and other factors as described below, cash flows from operating activities are influenced by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. The following information highlights factors that influenced the year-to-year change in cash flows provided by operating activities: • Gross operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $226.1 million over that recorded for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in gross operating margin is discussed under “Results of Operations” within this Item 7. • With respect to changes in operating accounts, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements improved year-to-year generally due to the successful integration of acquired businesses and increased efficiencies. As to cash receipts, the average collection period for accounts receivable during the year ended December 31, 2006 improved approximately nine days when compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, with the related turnover rate increasing 26% year-to-year. In addition, as to cash disbursements, our payable turnover rate increased significantly year-to-year. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. Our cash outlays for business combinations were $276.5 million in 2006 versus $326.6 million in 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we paid $100.0 million for a 100% interest in Piceance Creek Pipeline, LLC and paid Lewis $145.2 million in cash in connection with the Encinal acquisition. Our cash outlay for acquisitions during 2005 included (i) $145.5 million for storage assets purchased from Ferrellgas LP, (ii) $74.9 million for indirect interests in certain East Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets, (iii) $68.6 million for additional ownership interests in Dixie and (iv) $25.0 million for the remaining ownership interests in our Mid-America Pipeline System and an additional interest in the Seminole Pipeline. Proceeds from the sale of assets during 2005 include $42.1 million from the sale of our investment in Starfish Pipeline Company, LLC (“Starfish”). We were required to divest our ownership interest in this entity by the Federal Trade Commission in order to gain its approval for our merger with GulfTerra Energy Partners, L.P. in September 2004. In addition, we received $47.5 million as a return of our investment in Cameron Highway in June 2005. As a result of refinancing its project debt, Cameron Highway was authorized by its lenders to make this special distribution. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates were $138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $87.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The 2006 period includes $120.1 million we invested to date in Jonah. The 2005 period primarily reflects $72.0 million we contributed to Deepwater Gateway to fund our share of the repayment of its construction loan in March 2005. For additional information related to our capital spending program, see “Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. Financing activities Cash provided by financing activities was $495.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $516.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. As a result of our capital spending program, we utilized the Operating Partnership’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility in varying degrees throughout 2006. During 2006, we applied all or a portion of the net proceeds from equity and debt offerings to reduce debt outstanding. We used $430 million of net proceeds from our March 2006 equity offering and $260 million of net proceeds from our September 2006 equity offering to temporarily reduce amounts due under the Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. We also used the net proceeds from the Operating Partnership’s issuance of Junior Subordinated Notes A in the third quarter of 2006 to reduce 78 Table of Contents debt outstanding under this facility. We used any remaining net proceeds from these offerings in 2006 for general partnership purposes. During 2005, our Operating Partnership issued an aggregate of $1 billion in senior notes, the proceeds of which were used to repay $350 million due under Senior Notes A, to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under our bank credit facilities and for general partnership purposes. Additionally, we repaid the remaining $242.2 million that was due under our 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility (which was used to finance elements of the GulfTerra Merger) using proceeds generated from our February 2005 equity offering. Net proceeds from the issuance of our limited partner interests were $857.2 million for 2006 compared to $646.9 million for 2005. With respect to equity offerings (including sales through our distribution reinvestment program and employee unit purchase plan), we issued 34,824,649 common units 2006 versus 23,979,740 common units during 2005. Net proceeds from underwritten equity offerings were $750.8 million during 2006 reflecting the sale of 31,050,000 common units and $555.5 million during 2005 reflecting the sale of 21,250,000 common units. Our distribution reinvestment program and related employee unit purchase plan generated net proceeds of $96.9 million during 2006, including $50 million reinvested by EPCO. In comparison, this program generated proceeds of $69.7 million during 2005, including $30 million reinvested by EPCO. Cash distributions to partners increased from $716.7 million during 2005 to $843.3 million during 2006. The period-to-period increase in cash distributions is due to an increase in common units outstanding and quarterly cash distribution rates. Cash contributions from minority interests were $27.6 million for 2006 compared to $39.1 million for 2005. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2005 with Year Ended December 31, 2004 Operating activities. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $240.2 million over that recorded for the year ended December 31, 2004. The following information highlights factors that influenced the year-to-year change in cash flows provided by operating activities: • Gross operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $481.2 million over that recorded for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in gross operating margin is discussed under “Results of Operations” within this Item 7. • Cash payments for interest for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $103.3 million over that recorded for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in cash outflows for interest was due to the additional debt we incurred to complete the GulfTerra Merger. • The carrying value of our inventories increased from $189 million at December 31, 2004 to $339.6 million at December 31, 2005. The $150.6 million increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices during 2005 when compared to 2004 and an increase in volumes purchased and held in inventory in connection with our marketing activities at December 31, 2005 versus December 31, 2004. • With respect to changes in operating accounts, the timing of cash disbursements slowed following the GulfTerra Merger as integration activities were ongoing. A slight improvement in the collection of accounts receivable also added to our operating cash flows. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion in 2005 compared to $941.4 million in 2004. Expenditures for growth and sustaining capital projects (net of contributions in aid of construction costs) increased $670.5 million year-to-year primarily due to cash payments associated with our offshore Gulf of Mexico projects. Our cash outlays for business combinations were $326.6 million in 2005 versus $724.7 million in 2004. The 2004 period includes $638.8 million paid to El Paso in connection with the GulfTerra Merger. 79 Table of Contents Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates increased to $87.3 million in 2005 from $57.9 million in 2004. In 2005, we contributed $72.0 million to Deepwater Gateway to fund our share of the repayment of its term loan. During 2004, we used $27.5 million to acquire additional ownership interests in Promix, which owns the Promix NGL fractionator, and contributed $24.0 million to Cameron Highway for the construction of its crude oil pipeline. Cash flows related to investing activities for 2005 also include (i) a $47.5 million cash receipt related to the partial return of our investment in Cameron Highway and (ii) a $42.1 million cash receipt from the sale of our investment in Starfish. The sale of our Starfish investment was required by the FTC in order to gain its approval for the GulfTerra Merger. Financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $516.2 million in 2005 compared to $544.0 million in 2004. We had net borrowings under our debt agreements of $561.7 million during 2005 versus $125.6 million during 2004. During 2005, we issued an aggregate $1 billion in senior notes, the proceeds of which were used to temporarily reduce debt outstanding under our bank credit facilities, repay Senior Notes A and for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures, asset purchases and business combinations. In addition, we repaid the remaining $242.2 million that was outstanding at the end of 2004 under our 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility using proceeds from our February 2005 equity offering. We used the net proceeds from our November 2005 equity offering to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under our Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In September 2004, we borrowed $2.8 billion under our bank credit facilities (principally the 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility) to fund $655.3 million in cash payment obligations to El Paso in connection with the GulfTerra Merger; purchase $1.1 billion of GulfTerra’s senior and senior subordinated notes in connection with our tender offers; and repay $962 million outstanding under GulfTerra’s revolving credit facility and secured term loans. In October 2004, we issued an aggregate $2 billion in senior notes, the proceeds of which were used to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our bank credit facilities. Our repayments of debt during 2004 also reflect the use of $563.1 million of net proceeds from our May 2004 and August 2004 equity offerings to reduce indebtedness under bank credit facilities. Net proceeds from the issuance of limited partner interests were $646.9 million in 2005 compared to $846.1 million in 2004. We issued 23,979,740 common units in 2005 and 39,683,591 common units in 2004. Net proceeds from underwritten equity offerings were $555.5 million during 2005 reflecting the sale of 21,250,000 units and $694.3 million during 2004 reflecting the sale of 34,500,000 units. We used net proceeds from these underwritten offerings to reduce debt, including the temporary repayment of indebtedness under bank credit facilities. Our distribution reinvestment program and related plan generated net proceeds of $69.7 million in 2005 and $111.6 million in 2004. We used net proceeds from these offerings for general partnership purposes. For additional information regarding our equity issuances, please read Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Cash distributions to partners increased from $438.8 million in 2004 to $716.7 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in common units outstanding and our quarterly cash distribution rates. We expect that future cash distributions to partners will increase as a result of our periodic issuance of common units. Cash contributions from minority interests were $39.1 million in 2005 compared to $9.6 million in 2004. These amounts relate to contributions from our joint venture partner in the Independence Hub project. Our financing activities for 2004 include a net cash receipt of $19.4 million resulting from the settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps. Critical Accounting Policies In our financial reporting process, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of 80 Table of Contents our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following describes the estimation risk underlying our most significant financial statement items: Depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the assets. Our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Some of these circumstances include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration and abandonment requirements; changes in expected costs for dismantlement, restoration and abandonment as a result of changes, or expected changes, in labor, materials and other related costs associated with these activities; changes in the useful life of an asset based on the actual known life of similar assets, changes in technology, or other factors; and changes in expected salvage proceeds as a result of a change, or expected change in the salvage market. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was $9.8 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively. We recorded $352.2 million, $328.7 million and $161.0 million in depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A significant portion of the year-to-year increase in depreciation expense between 2005 and 2004 is attributable to the property, plant and equipment assets we acquired in the GulfTerra Merger in September 2004. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Notes 2 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring recoverability of long-lived assets and equity method investments In general, long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, oil or NGLs. Long-lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through future expected cash flows are written-down to their estimated fair values. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the existing asset. Our estimates of such undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated salvage values. An impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is based on a series of assumptions similar to those used to derive undiscounted cash flows. Those assumptions also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes, market values and replacement cost estimates. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible loss in value for the investment other than a temporary decline. Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee’s industry. The carrying value of an equity method investment is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of discounted estimated cash flows expected to be derived from the investment. This estimate of discounted cash flows is based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment. A significant change in these underlying assumptions could result in our recording an impairment charge. 81 Table of Contents We recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment of $0.1 million in 2006 and $4.1 million in 2004, which are reflected as components of operating costs and expenses. No such asset impairment charges were recorded in 2005. During 2006, we evaluated our equity method investment in Neptune Pipeline Company, L.L.C. for impairment. As a result of this evaluation, we recorded a $7.4 million non-cash impairment charge that is a component of equity income from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2006. We had no such impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2005 or 2004. For additional information regarding impairment charges associated with our long-lived assets and equity method investments, see Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Amortization methods and estimated useful lives of qualifying intangible assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential intangible assets include intellectual property, such as technology, patents, trademarks and trade names, customer contracts and relationships, and non-compete agreements, as well as other intangible assets. The method used to value each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset, the business in which it is utilized, and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. Our customer relationship intangible assets primarily represent the customer base we acquired in connection with business combinations and asset purchases. The value we assigned to these customer relationships is being amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits of the underlying oil and natural gas resource bases from which the customers produce are estimated to be consumed or otherwise used. Our estimate of the useful life of each resource base is based on a number of factors, including third-party reserve estimates, the economic viability of production and exploration activities and other industry factors. Our contract-based intangible assets represent the rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated useful life (or term), which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of an entity. Our estimates of useful life are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., fractionation facility, pipeline, etc.), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights, and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such agreements. If our underlying assumptions regarding the estimated useful life of an intangible asset change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, if we determine that an intangible asset’s unamortized cost may not be recoverable due to impairment; we may be required to reduce the carrying value and the subsequent useful life of the asset. Any such write-down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was $1.0 billion and $913.6 million, respectively. We recorded $88.8 million, $88.9 million and $33.8 million in amortization expense associated with our intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A significant portion of the year-to-year increase in amortization expense between 2005 and 2004 is attributable to the intangible assets we acquired in the GulfTerra Merger. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 82 Table of Contents Methods we employ to measure the fair value of goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase prices we paid for certain businesses over their respective fair values and is primarily comprised of $385.9 million associated with the GulfTerra Merger. We do not amortize goodwill; however, we test our goodwill (at the reporting unit level) for impairment during the second quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Our goodwill testing involves the determination of a reporting unit’s fair value, which is predicated on our assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the reporting unit. Such assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the assets contained within the reporting unit, which rely on management’s estimates of operating margins and transportation volumes, (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period, and (iii) appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of the reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a charge to earnings is required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying value of our goodwill was $590.5 million and $494.0 million, respectively. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our revenue recognition policies and use of estimates for revenues and expenses In general, we recognize revenue from our customers when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. When sales contracts are settled (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed), we record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts. Our use of certain estimates for revenues and expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the timing of compiling actual billing information and receiving third-party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of such use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for the subject period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month, adjusted accordingly for any known or expected changes in volumes or rates through the end of the month. If the basis of our estimates proves to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates. Reserves for environmental matters Each of our business segments is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations may, in certain instances, require us to remediate current or former operating sites where specified substances have been released or disposed of. We accrue reserves for environmental matters when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments are based on studies, as well as site surveys, to determine the extent of any environmental damage and the necessary requirements to remediate this damage. Future environmental developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws and additional claims for damages to property, employees and other persons resulting from current or past operations, could result in substantial additional costs beyond our current reserves. 83 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a liability for environmental remediation of $24.2 million and $22.1 million, respectively, which was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon studies and site surveys. We follow the provisions of AICPA Statement of Position 96-1, which provides key guidance on recognition, measurement and disclosure of remediation liabilities. We have recorded our best estimate of the cost of remediation activities. See Item 3 of this annual report for recent developments regarding environmental matters. Natural gas imbalances In the pipeline transportation business, natural gas imbalances frequently result from differences in gas volumes received from and delivered to our customers. Such differences occur when a customer delivers more or less gas into our pipelines than is physically redelivered back to them during a particular time period. The vast majority of our settlements are through in-kind arrangements whereby incremental volumes are delivered to a customer (in the case of an imbalance payable) or received from a customer (in the case of an imbalance receivable). Such in-kind deliveries are on-going and take place over several months. In some cases, settlements of imbalances built up over a period of time are ultimately cashed out and are generally negotiated at values which approximate average market prices over a period of time. As a result, for gas imbalances that are ultimately settled over future periods, we estimate the value of such current assets and liabilities using average market prices, which is representative of the estimated value of the imbalances upon final settlement. Changes in natural gas prices may impact our estimates. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, our imbalance receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, were $97.8 million and $89.4 million, respectively, and are reflected as a component of “Accounts and notes receivable – trade” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, our imbalance payables were $51.2 million and $80.5 million, respectively, and are reflected as a component of “Accrued gas payables” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other Items Initial Public Offering of Duncan Energy Partners In September 2006, we formed a consolidated subsidiary, Duncan Energy Partners, to acquire, own and operate a diversified portfolio of midstream energy assets. On February 5, 2007, this subsidiary completed its initial public offering of 14,950,000 common units (including an overallotment amount of 1,950,000 common units) at $21.00 per unit, which generated net proceeds to Duncan Energy Partners of $291.3 million. As consideration for assets contributed and reimbursement for capital expenditures related to these assets, Duncan Energy Partners distributed $260.6 million of these net proceeds to us along with $198.9 million in borrowings under its credit facility and a final amount of 5,371,571 common units of Duncan Energy Partners. Duncan Energy Partners used $38.5 million of net proceeds from the overallotment to redeem 1,950,000 of the 7,301,571 common units it had originally issued to Enterprise Products Partners, resulting in the final amount of 5,371,571 common units beneficially owned by Enterprise Products Partners. We used the cash received from Duncan Energy Partners to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under our Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In summary, we contributed 66% of our equity interests in the following subsidiaries to Duncan Energy Partners: • Mont Belvieu Caverns, LLC (“Mont Belvieu Caverns”), a recently formed subsidiary, which owns salt dome storage caverns located in Mont Belvieu, Texas that receive, store and deliver NGLs and certain petrochemical products for industrial customers located along the upper Texas Gulf Coast, which has the largest concentration of petrochemical plants and refineries in the United States; • Acadian Gas, LLC (“Acadian Gas”), which owns an onshore natural gas pipeline system that gathers, transports, stores and markets natural gas in Louisiana. The Acadian Gas system links natural gas supplies from onshore and offshore Gulf of Mexico developments (including offshore 84 Table of Contents pipelines, continental shelf and deepwater production) with local gas distribution companies, electric generation plants and industrial customers, including those in the Baton Rouge-New Orleans-Mississippi River corridor. A subsidiary of Acadian Gas owns a 49.5% equity interest in Evangeline Gas Pipeline, L.P. (“Evangeline”); • Sabine Propylene Pipeline L.P. (“Sabine Propylene”), which transports polymer-grade propylene between Port Arthur, Texas and a pipeline interconnect located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana; • Enterprise Lou-Tex Propylene Pipeline L.P. (“Lou-Tex Propylene”), which transports chemical-grade propylene from Sorrento, Louisiana to Mont Belvieu, Texas; and • South Texas NGL Pipelines, LLC (“South Texas NGL”), a recently formed subsidiary, which began transporting NGLs from Corpus Christi, Texas to Mont Belvieu, Texas in January 2007. South Texas NGL owns the DEP South Texas NGL Pipeline System. In addition, to the 34% ownership interest we retained in each of these entities, we also own the 2% general partner interest in Duncan Energy Partners and 26.4% of Duncan Energy Partners’ outstanding common units. Our Operating Partnership directs the business operations of Duncan Energy Partners through its ownership and control of the general partner of Duncan Energy Partners. The formation of Duncan Energy Partners had no effect on our financial statements at December 31, 2006. For financial reporting purposes, the consolidated financial statements of Duncan Energy Partners will be consolidated into those of our own. Consequently, the results of operations of Duncan Energy Partners will be a component of our business segments. Also, due to common control of the entities by Dan L. Duncan, the initial consolidated balance sheet of Duncan Energy Partners will reflect our historical carrying basis in each of the subsidiaries contributed to Duncan Energy Partners. The public owners of Duncan Energy Partners’ common units will be presented as a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements beginning in February 2007. The public owners of Duncan Energy Partners have no direct equity interests in us as a result of this transaction. The borrowings of Duncan Energy Partners will be presented as part of our consolidated debt; however, we do not have any obligation for the payment of interest or repayment of borrowings incurred by Duncan Energy Partners. We have significant continuing involvement with all of the subsidiaries of Duncan Energy Partners, including the following types of transactions: • We utilize storage services provided by Mont Belvieu Caverns to support our Mont Belvieu fractionation and other businesses; • We buy natural gas from and sell natural gas to Acadian Gas in connection with its normal business activities; and • We are the sole shipper on the DEP South Texas NGL Pipeline System. We may contribute other equity interests in our subsidiaries to Duncan Energy Partners in the near term and use the proceeds we receive from Duncan Energy Partners to fund our capital spending program. We have no obligation or commitment to make such contributions to Duncan Energy Partners. 85 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands). For additional information regarding these significant contractual obligations, see Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report.

We secure a portion of these notes by (i) a pledge by us of our 50% partnership interest in Cameron Highway, (ii) mortgages on and pledges of certain assets related to certain rights of way and pipeline assets of an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ours that serves as the operator of the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline, and (iii) letters of credit in an initial amount of $18.4 million issued by the Operating Partnership on behalf of Cameron Highway. In March 2006, Cameron Highway amended the note purchase agreement governing its senior secured notes to primarily address the effect of reduced deliveries of crude oil to Cameron Highway resulting from production delays caused by the lingering effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In general, this amendment modified certain financial covenants in light of production forecasts. In addition, the amendment increased the face amount of the letters of credit required to be issued by our Operating Partnership and an affiliate of our joint venture partner from $18.4 million each to $36.8 million each. For more information regarding Cameron Highway’s senior secured notes, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. In May 2006, Poseidon amended its revolving credit facility to, among other things, reduce commitments from $170.0 million to $150.0 million, extend the maturity date from January 2008 to May 2011 and lower the borrowing rate. At December 31, 2006, long term debt for Evangeline consisted of (i) $18.2 million in principal amount of 9.9% fixed rate Series B senior secured notes due December 2010 and (ii) a $7.5 million subordinated note payable. In addition, we furnished $1.1 million in letters of credit on behalf of Evangeline at December 31, 2006. Except for the foregoing, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements, as described in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future 86 Table of Contents effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for the information regarding the debt obligations of our unconsolidated affiliates. Summary of Related Party Transactions The following table summarizes our related party transactions for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands). For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Revenues from consolidated operations EPCO and affiliates $ 98,671 $ 311 $ 2,697 Shell — — 542,912 Unconsolidated affiliates 304,559 354,461 258,541 Total $ 403,230 $ 354,772 $ 804,150 Operating costs and expenses EPCO and affiliates $ 311,537 $ 293,134 $ 203,100 Shell — — 725,420 Unconsolidated affiliates 31,606 23,563 37,587 Total $ 343,143 $ 316,697 $ 966,107 General and administrative expenses EPCO and affiliates $ 41,265 $ 40,954 $ 29,307 For additional information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. For information regarding certain business relationships and related transactions, see Item 13 of this annual report. We have an extensive and ongoing relationship with EPCO and its affiliates, including TEPPCO. Our revenues from EPCO and affiliates are primarily associated with sales of NGL products. Our expenses with EPCO and affiliates are primarily due to (i) reimbursements we pay EPCO in connection with an administrative services agreement and (ii) purchases of NGL products. TEPPCO is an affiliate of ours due to the common control relationship of both entities. Many of our unconsolidated affiliates perform supporting or complementary roles to our consolidated business operations. The majority of our revenues from unconsolidated affiliates relate to natural gas sales to a Louisiana affiliate. The majority of our expenses with unconsolidated affiliates pertain to payments we make to K/D/S Promix, L.L.C. for NGL transportation, storage and fractionation services. On February 5, 2007, our consolidated subsidiary, Duncan Energy Partners, completed an underwritten initial public offering of its common units. Duncan Energy Partners was formed in September 2006 as a Delaware limited partnership to, among other things, acquire ownership interests in certain of our midstream energy businesses. For additional information regarding Duncan Energy Partners, see “Other Items – Initial Public Offering of Duncan Energy Partners” within this section. 87 Table of Contents Non-GAAP reconciliations A reconciliation of our measurement of total non-GAAP gross operating margin to GAAP operating income and income before provision for income taxes, minority interest and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles follows (dollars in thousands): For the Year the Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Total non-GAAP segment gross operating margin $ 1,362,449 $ 1,136,347 $ 655,191 Adjustments to reconcile total non-GAAP gross operating margin to GAAP operating income: Depreciation, amortization and accretion in operating costs and expenses (440,256 ) (413,441 ) (193,734 ) Retained lease expense, net in operating costs and expenses (2,109 ) (2,112 ) (7,705 ) Gain on sale of assets in operating costs and expenses 3,359 4,488 15,901 General and administrative costs (63,391 ) (62,266 ) (46,659 ) GAAP consolidated operating income 860,052 663,016 422,994 Other net expense, primarily interest expense (229,967 ) (225,178 ) (153,625 ) GAAP income before provision for income taxes, minority interest and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 630,085 $ 437,838 $ 269,369 EPCO subleases to us certain equipment located at our Mont Belvieu facility and 100 railcars for $1 per year (the “retained leases”). These subleases are part of the administrative services agreement that we executed with EPCO in connection with our formation in 1998. EPCO holds this equipment pursuant to operating leases for which it has retained the corresponding cash lease payment obligation. We record the full value of such lease payments made by EPCO as a non-cash related party operating expense, with the offset to partners’ equity recorded as a general contribution to our partnership. Apart from the partnership interests we granted to EPCO at our formation, EPCO does not receive any additional ownership rights as a result of its contribution to us of the retained leases. For additional information regarding the administrative services agreement and the retained leases, see Item 13 of this annual report. Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles Our Statements of Consolidated Operations reflect the following cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles: • We recognized, as a benefit, a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $1.5 million in 2006 based on the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” requirements to recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of an equity award and the application of an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested awards. • We recorded a $4.2 million non-cash expense related to certain asset retirement obligations in 2005 due to our implementation of FIN 47 as of December 31, 2005. • We recorded a combined $10.8 million non-cash gain in 2004 related to the impact of (i) changing the method our BEF subsidiary uses to account for its planned major maintenance activities from the accrue-in-advance method to the expense-as-incurred method and (ii) changing the method in which we account for our investment in VESCO from the cost method to the equity method. For additional information regarding these changes in accounting principles, including a presentation of the pro forma effects these changes would have had on our historical earnings, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 88 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements The accounting standard setting bodies and the SEC have recently issued the following accounting guidance that will or may affect our future financial statements: • Emerging Issues Task Force No. 06-3, “How Taxes Collected From Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation),” • SFAS 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments,” • SFAS 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” and • SFAS 159, “Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” For additional information regarding these recent accounting developments and others that may affect our future financial statements, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We may use financial instruments (i.e., futures, forwards, swaps, options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics) to mitigate the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions. In general, the type of risks we attempt to hedge are those related to (i) the variability of future earnings, (ii) fair values of certain debt instruments and (iii) cash flows resulting from changes in applicable interest rates or commodity prices. As a matter of policy, we do not use financial instruments for speculative (or “trading”) purposes. We recognize financial instruments as assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on fair value. Fair value is generally defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, not in a forced or liquidation sale. The estimated fair values of our financial instruments have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques. We must use considerable judgment, however, in interpreting market data and developing these estimates. Accordingly, our fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize upon disposition of these instruments. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation techniques could have a material effect on our estimates of fair value. Changes in the fair value of financial instrument contracts are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the financial instruments meet those criteria, the instrument’s gains and losses offset the related results of the hedged item in earnings for a fair value hedge and are deferred in other comprehensive income for a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses related to a cash flow hedge are reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For additional information regarding our accounting for financial instruments, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. To qualify as a hedge, the item to be hedged must be exposed to commodity, interest rate or exchange rate risk and the hedging instrument must reduce the exposure and meet the hedging requirements of SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (as amended and interpreted). We must formally designate the financial instrument as a hedge and document and assess the effectiveness of the hedge at inception and on a quarterly basis. Any ineffectiveness of the hedge is recorded in current earnings. We routinely review our outstanding financial instruments in light of current market conditions. If market conditions warrant, some financial instruments may be closed out in advance of their contractual settlement dates thus realizing income or loss depending on the specific exposure. When this occurs, we 89 Table of Contents may enter into a new financial instrument to reestablish the economic hedge to which the closed instrument relates. Interest Rate Risk Hedging Program Our interest rate exposure results from variable and fixed rate borrowings under debt agreements. We assess cash flow risk related to interest rates by identifying and measuring changes in our interest rate exposures that may impact future cash flows and evaluating hedging opportunities to manage these risks. We use analytical techniques to measure our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, including cash flow sensitivity analysis models to forecast the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows. Enterprise Products GP oversees the strategies associated with these financial risks and approves instruments that are appropriate for our requirements. We manage a portion of our interest rate exposures by utilizing interest rate swaps and similar arrangements, which allow us to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt or a portion of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt. We believe that it is prudent to maintain an appropriate balance of variable rate and fixed rate debt in the current business environment. Fair value hedges – Interest rate swaps As summarized in the following table, we had eleven interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2006 that were accounted for as fair value hedges. Number Period Covered Termination Fixed to Notional Hedged Fixed Rate Debt Of Swaps by Swap Date of Swap Variable Rate (1) Amount Senior Notes B, 7.50% fixed rate, due Feb. 2011 1 Jan. 2004 to Feb. 2011 Feb. 2011 7.50% to 8.89% $50 million Senior Notes C, 6.375% fixed rate, due Feb. 2013 2 Jan. 2004 to Feb. 2013 Feb. 2013 6.38% to 7.43% $200 million Senior Notes G, 5.6% fixed rate, due Oct. 2014 6 4th Qtr. 2004 to Oct. 2014 Oct. 2014 5.60% to 6.33% $600 million Senior Notes K, 4.95% fixed rate, due June 2010 2 Aug. 2005 to June 2010 June 2010 4.95% to 5.76% $200 million (1) The variable rate indicated is the all-in variable rate for the current settlement period. We have designated these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges under SFAS 133 since they mitigate changes in the fair value of the underlying fixed rate debt. As effective fair value hedges, an increase in the fair value of these interest rate swaps is equally offset by an increase in the fair value of the underlying hedged debt. The offsetting changes in fair value have no effect on current period interest expense. These eleven agreements have a combined notional amount of $1.1 billion and match the maturity dates of the underlying debt being hedged. Under each swap agreement, we pay the counterparty a variable interest rate based on six-month London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) (plus an applicable margin as defined in each swap agreement), and receive back from the counterparty a fixed interest rate payment based on the stated interest rate of the debt being hedged, with both payments calculated using the notional amounts stated in each swap agreement. We settle amounts receivable from or payable to the counterparties every six months (the “settlement period”). The settlement amount is amortized ratably to earnings as either an increase or a decrease in interest expense over the settlement period. The total fair value of these eleven interest rate swaps at December 31, 2006, was a liability of $29.1 million, with an offsetting decrease in the fair value of the underlying debt. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 reflects a $5.2 million loss, $10.8 million benefit and $9.1 million benefit from these swap agreements, respectively. 90 Table of Contents The following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap portfolio and the related change in fair value of the underlying debt at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). Income is not affected by changes in the fair value of these swaps; however, these swaps effectively convert the hedged portion of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. As a result, interest expense (and related cash outlays for debt service) will increase or decrease with the change in the periodic “reset” rate associated with the respective swap. Typically, the reset rate is an agreed upon index rate published for the first day of the six-month interest calculation period. Swap Fair Value at Resulting Scenario Classification December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 February 7, 2007 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) $ (19,179 ) $ (29,060 ) $ (31,918 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) (50,308 ) (56,249 ) (58,956 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) 11,950 (1,872 ) (4,881 ) The fair value of the interest rate swaps excludes the benefit (detriment) we have already recorded in earnings. The change in fair value between December 31, 2006 and February 7, 2007 is primarily due to an increase in market interest rates relative to the forward interest rate curve used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. The underlying floating LIBOR forward interest rate curve used to determine the February 7, 2007 fair values ranged from approximately 4.8% to 5.4% using 6-month reset periods ranging from February 2007 to October 2014. Cash flow hedges – Treasury locks During the second quarter of 2006, the Operating Partnership entered into a treasury lock transaction having a notional amount of $250.0 million. In addition, in July 2006, the Operating Partnership entered into an additional treasury lock transaction having a notional amount of $50.0 million. A treasury lock is a specialized agreement that fixes the price (or yield) on a specific treasury security for an established period of time. A treasury lock purchaser is protected from a rise in the yield of the underlying treasury security during the lock period. The Operating Partnership’s purpose in entering into these transactions was to hedge the underlying U.S. treasury rate related to its anticipated issuance of subordinated debt during the second quarter of 2006. In July 2006, the Operating Partnership issued $300.0 million in principal amount of its Junior Subordinated Notes A (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8). Each of the treasury lock transactions was designated as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. In July 2006, the Operating Partnership elected to terminate these treasury lock transactions and recognized a minimal gain. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Operating Partnership entered into treasury lock transactions having a notional value of $562.5 million. The Operating Partnership entered into these transactions to hedge the underlying U.S. treasury rates related to its anticipated issuances of debt during 2007. Each of the treasury lock transactions was designated as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. At December 31, 2006, the value of the treasury locks was $11.2 million. On February 27, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into additional treasury lock transactions having a notional value of $437.5 million. The Operating Partnership entered into these transactions to hedge the underlying U.S. treasury rates related to its anticipated issuances of debt during 2007. Each of the treasury lock transactions will be designated as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. Commodity Risk Hedging Program The prices of natural gas, NGLs and petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage the price risks associated with such products, we may enter into commodity financial instruments. The primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to price risks associated with (i) natural gas purchases, (ii) the value of NGL production and inventories, (iii) related firm commitments, (iv) fluctuations in transportation revenues where the underlying fees are based on natural gas index prices and (v) certain anticipated transactions involving either natural gas, NGLs or certain petrochemical products. The commodity financial instruments we utilize may be settled in cash or with another financial instrument. 91 Table of Contents The fair value of our commodity financial instrument portfolio at December 31, 2006 was a liability of $3.2 million. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded $10.3 million, $1.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of income related to our commodity financial instruments, which is included in operating costs and expenses on our Statements of Consolidated Operations. We assess the risk of our commodity financial instrument portfolio using a sensitivity analysis model. The sensitivity analysis applied to this portfolio measures the potential income or loss (i.e., the change in fair value of the portfolio) based upon a hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying quoted market prices of the commodity financial instruments outstanding at the date indicated within the following table. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value (“FV”) of this portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in thousands): Commodity Financial Instrument Portfolio FV Resulting Scenario Classification December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 February 7, 2007 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ (53 ) $ (3,184 ) $ 549 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (53 ) (2,119 ) 1,734 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (53 ) (4,249 ) (637 ) Foreign Currency Hedging Program In October 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of an affiliated NGL marketing company located in Canada from EPCO and Dan L. Duncan. Since this foreign subsidiary’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar, we could be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to hedge this risk using foreign purchase contracts to fix the exchange rate. As of December 31, 2006, we had entered into foreign purchase contracts valued at $5.1 million, all of which settled in January 2007. In January and February 2007, we entered into $3.8 million and $4.8 million, respectively, of such instruments. These contracts typically settle in the month following their inception. Due to the limited duration of these contracts, we utilize mark-to-market accounting for these transactions, the effect of which has had a minimal impact on our earnings. Product Purchase Commitments We have long and short-term purchase commitments for NGLs, petrochemicals and natural gas with several suppliers. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. For additional information regarding these commitments, see “Contractual Obligations” included under Item 7 of this annual report.",2023-12-30 21:16:57.309475

Recent Developments The following information highlights our significant developments since January 1, 2007 through the date of this filing. Questar Pipeline and Enterprise Products Partners Enter Into Definitive Agreements to Construct New Rockies Natural Gas Pipeline Hub In February 2008, we entered into definitive agreements with Questar Pipeline Company (“Questar”) to develop a new natural gas pipeline hub in the Rockies. As proposed, the White River Hub would be a header system that will be owned equally by us and Questar. The facilities would connect our natural gas processing complex near Meeker, Colorado, with up to six interstate pipelines in the Piceance Basin area, including the Questar Pipeline. Our Pioneer Cryogenic Natural Gas Processing Facility Commences Operations In February 2008, we commenced operations at our recently completed Pioneer cryogenic natural gas processing facility. Located near the Opal Hub in southwestern Wyoming, this new facility is designed to process up to 750 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract as much as 30 MBPD of NGLs. We intend to maintain the operational capability of our Pioneer silica gel natural gas processing plant, which is located adjacent to the Pioneer cryogenic plant, as a back-up to provide producers with additional assurance of our processing capability at the complex. NGLs extracted at our Pioneer complex are transported on our Mid-America Pipeline System and ultimately to our Hobbs and Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators. We and the Jicarilla Apache Nation Announce Plans to Form Joint Venture involving our San Juan Natural Gas Gathering Assets In November 2007, we and the Jicarilla Apache Nation announced our plans for the formation of a joint venture to own and operate natural gas gathering assets located on or near Jicarilla Apache Nation reservation lands. The joint venture would own and operate gathering assets in northwest New Mexico that were previously 100% owned by us. In order to take effect, the agreements related to the joint venture must be approved by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Jicarilla Apache Nation is a federally-recognized Indian tribe, whose Reservation was established in 1887 and now consists of approximately 880,000 acres of land located on the eastern edge of the San Juan Basin. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, we would receive relatively equivalent value for our contributions of (i) 545 miles of gathering lines, which have an approximate throughput of 31 MMcf/d, (ii) related gathering assets and (iii) 40 MMcf/d of redelivery and natural gas processing capacity through our San Juan Gathering System. The Jicarilla Apache Nation would contribute rights for access and use of reservation lands for operation and expansion of the joint venture gathering system, which will be operated 54 Table of Contents by us. The joint venture assets are currently part of our San Juan Gathering System, which is comprised of approximately 6,065 miles of natural gas pipelines in New Mexico and Colorado that gather more than 1 Bcf/d of natural gas. EPO Increases and Extends its Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility In November 2007, EPO amended its existing Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility to, among other terms, increase total bank commitments from $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion and extend the maturity date to November 2012. In addition, the amendment provides us with the option to further increase commitments under the credit facility up to a maximum of $2.25 billion upon satisfaction of certain conditions. For additional information regarding this issuance of debt, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our Meeker Natural Gas Processing Facility Commences Operations In October 2007, we commenced natural gas processing operations at our Meeker I facility, which recently completed its first phase of construction. Located in Colorado’s Piceance Basin, our Meeker I facility has a processing capacity of 750 MMcf/d of natural gas and is capable of extracting up to 35 MBPD of mixed NGLs. The Meeker II facility, which is under construction and expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2008, will double its processing capacity to 1.5 Bcf/d of natural gas and 70 MBPD of mixed NGLs. The two phases are supported by long-term commitments from producers, including EnCana and ExxonMobil. By the end of 2008, natural gas volumes processed at the facility are expected to exceed 800 MMcf/d, which we believe could yield to us approximately 40 MBPD of equity NGLs in full extraction mode. The Piceance Basin represents one of the most prolific and fastest growing energy producing areas in the nation, and the completion of our Meeker facility provides the region with valuable midstream infrastructure needed to accommodate those growing volumes. Completion of the Final Phase of our Mid-America Pipeline Expansion Project In October 2007, we completed the expansion of the Rocky Mountain portion of our Mid-America Pipeline (“MAPL”) system. The final phase of this project consisted of installing new pumps and the modification of existing pumps, which increased system capacity by 20 MBPD. The first phase, which was completed in April 2007, provided an additional 30 MBPD of system capacity. Overall, these expansion projects increased the capacity of MAPL’s Rocky Mountain system from 225 MBPD to 275 MBPD. This expansion will accommodate expected mixed NGL volumes originating from our Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco facilities. EPO Issues $800.0 Million of Senior Notes In September 2007, EPO sold $800.0 million in principal amount of 6.30% fixed-rate, unsecured senior notes due September 2017. Net proceeds from this offering were used to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In October 2007, EPO used borrowing capacity under its revolver to repay $500.0 million in principal amount due under its maturing Senior Notes E. For additional information regarding this issuance of debt, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Expansion of our Mont Belvieu Petrochemical Assets Completed In August 2007, we completed the expansion of our petrochemical assets in Mont Belvieu and southeast Texas. This expansion project included (i) the construction of a fourth propylene fractionator at our Mont Belvieu complex, which increased our propylene/propane fractionation capacity by approximately one billion pounds per year, or 15 MBPD, and (ii) the expansion of two refinery grade propylene pipelines which added 50 MBPD of capacity into Mont Belvieu. 55 Table of Contents Completion of our Hobbs NGL Fractionator In August 2007, we completed construction of our Hobbs NGL fractionator, which is designed to handle up to 75 MBPD of mixed NGLs. The new fractionator is strategically located at the interconnection of our MAPL and our Seminole pipelines near Hobbs, New Mexico. Our Hobbs NGL fractionator offers another key hub for separating mixed NGLs produced at our Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco facilities into purity NGL products. Changes in our Management Team In July 2007, we announced changes to our senior management team that became effective August 1, 2007. The board of directors of our general partner elected Michael A. Creel president and chief executive officer, W. Randall Fowler executive vice president and chief financial officer, and William Ordemann executive vice president and chief operating officer. Mr. Creel replaces Robert G. Phillips who resigned effective June 30, 2007. Mr. Fowler was promoted to fill the position left vacant by Mr. Creel’s promotion. Mr. Ordemann was promoted to fill the position vacated by Dr. Ralph S. Cunningham, who is now the president and chief executive officer of Enterprise GP Holdings. Mr. Creel had previously held this position. Our Independence Hub Platform and Trail Pipeline Receive First Production In July 2007, our Independence Hub platform and Independence Trail pipeline received first production from deepwater production wells connected to the Independence Hub platform. As a result, these assets began earning fee-based revenues for natural gas processing and transportation services. These amounts are in addition to the demand fee revenues that Independence Hub began earning in March 2007. Currently, the platform is receiving approximately 900 MMcf/d of natural gas from fifteen wells. We and TEPPCO Complete the First Portion of the Jonah Phase V Expansion Project In July 2007, we completed the first portion of the Phase V Expansion of the Jonah Gathering System, which increased the system gathering capacity to 2.0 Bcf/d. The second and final phase of the expansion, which is targeted for completion in April 2008, is expected to increase the system’s gathering capacity further to 2.4 Bcf/d. Expansion of our Houston Ship Channel NGL Import and Export Terminal Completed In June 2007, we announced the completion of our project to expand the capabilities of our import/export terminal at the Houston Ship Channel to handle incremental volumes of natural gas liquids and liquefied petroleum gases. EPO Issues $700.0 Million of Junior Notes In May 2007, EPO sold $700 million in principal amount of fixed/floating unsecured junior subordinated notes due January 2068. Net proceeds from this offering were used by EPO to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under its Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and for general partnership purposes. For additional information regarding this issuance of debt, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Creation of our Natural Gas Services and Marketing Business In March 2007, we announced the expansion of our natural gas services and marketing business similar to our existing NGL and petrochemical marketing businesses. This business will include all of our existing natural gas supply and marketing activities, which currently include producer wellhead services, facility fuel procurement, pipeline and storage capacity optimization and a full range of market customer delivery arrangements. This initiative is expected to broaden our role in the natural gas markets by linking 56 Table of Contents our extensive U.S. natural gas pipeline and storage assets, thus providing customers with value-added solutions and reducing our operating costs through enhanced fuel procurement practices. Duncan Energy Partners Completes its Initial Public Offering In February 2007, a consolidated subsidiary of ours, Duncan Energy Partners, completed its underwritten initial public offering of 14,950,000 common units. Duncan Energy Partners, a Delaware limited partnership, was formed by EPO to acquire ownership interests in certain of our midstream energy businesses. EPO owns the 2% general partner interest and 5,351,571 common units of Duncan Energy Partners as well as a direct 34% equity interest in each of Duncan Energy Partners operating subsidiaries. For additional information regarding Duncan Energy Partners, see “Other Items – Initial Public Offering of Duncan Energy Partners” included within this Item 7. Results of Operations We have four reportable business segments: NGL Pipelines & Services; Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services; Offshore Pipelines & Services; and Petrochemical Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the type of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. Our non-GAAP financial measure of total segment gross operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP operating income. We define total segment gross operating margin as consolidated operating income before (i) depreciation, amortization and accretion expense; (ii) operating lease expenses for which we do not have the payment obligation; (iii) gains and losses on the sale of assets; and (iv) general and administrative costs. Gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, provision for income taxes, minority interest, extraordinary charges and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses (net of the adjustments noted above) from segment revenues, with both segment totals before the elimination of intersegment and intrasegment transactions. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. We include earnings from equity method unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin and operating income. Our equity investments with industry partners are a vital component of our business strategy. They are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with those of our customers and/or suppliers. This method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand-alone basis. Many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations. As circumstances dictate, we may increase our ownership interest in equity investments, which could result in their subsequent consolidation into our operations. Our consolidated gross operating margin amounts include the gross operating margin amounts of Duncan Energy Partners on a 100% basis. Volumetric data associated with the operations of Duncan Energy Partners are also included on a 100% basis in our consolidated statistical data. For additional information regarding our business segments, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 57 Table of Contents Selected Price and Volumetric Data The following table illustrates selected annual and quarterly industry index prices for natural gas, crude oil and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods presented.

The following table summarizes the contribution to consolidated revenues from the sale of NGL, natural gas and petrochemical products during the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 NGL Pipelines & Services: Sale of NGL products $ 11,822,291 $ 9,496,926 $ 8,176,370 Percent of consolidated revenues 70 % 68 % 67 % Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services: Sale of natural gas $ 1,633,214 $ 1,228,916 $ 1,065,542 Percent of consolidated revenues 10 % 9 % 9 % Petrochemical Services: Sale of petrochemical products $ 1,796,251 $ 1,545,693 $ 1,311,956 Percent of consolidated revenues 11 % 11 % 11 % Comparison of 2007 with 2006 Revenues for 2007 were $16.95 billion compared to $13.99 billion for 2006. The increase in consolidated revenues year-to-year is primarily due to higher sales volumes and energy commodity prices in 2007 relative to 2006. These factors accounted for a $2.98 billion increase in consolidated revenues associated with our marketing activities. Revenues from business interruption insurance proceeds totaled $36.1 million in 2007 compared to $63.9 million in 2006. Operating costs and expenses were $16.01 billion for 2007 versus $13.09 billion for 2006. The year-to-year increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses is primarily due to an increase in the 59 Table of Contents cost of sales associated with our marketing activities. The cost of sales of our NGL, natural gas and petrochemical products increased $2.46 billion year-to-year as a result of an increase in volumes and higher energy commodity prices. Operating costs and expenses associated with our natural gas processing plants increased $185.7 million year-to-year as a result of higher energy commodity prices in 2007 relative to 2006. Operating costs and expenses associated with assets we constructed and placed into service or acquired since January 1, 2006 increased $188.1 million year-to-year. General and administrative costs were $87.7 million for 2007 compared to $63.4 million for 2006. The $24.3 million year-to-year increase in general and administrative costs is primarily due to the recognition of a severance obligation during 2007 and an increase in legal fees. Changes in our revenues and costs and expenses year-to-year are explained in part by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $1.19 per gallon during 2007 versus $1.00 per gallon during 2006, a year-to-year increase of 19%. Our determination of the weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs is based on U.S. Gulf Coast prices for such products at Mont Belvieu, which is the primary industry hub for domestic NGL production. The market price of natural gas (as measured at Henry Hub) averaged $6.86 per MMBtu during 2007 versus $7.24 per MMBtu during 2006. For additional historical energy commodity pricing information, see the table on page 58. Equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates were $29.7 million for 2007 compared to $21.6 million for 2006. Equity earnings from our investment in Jonah increased $9.1 million year-to-year. Equity earnings for 2007 include a non-cash impairment charge of $7.0 million associated with our investment in Nemo compared to a non-cash impairment charge of $7.4 million in 2006 related to our investment in Neptune. Collectively, equity earnings from our other unconsolidated affiliates decreased $1.4 million year-to-year primarily due to the sale of our investment in Coyote Gas Treating, LLC in August 2006. Operating income for 2007 was $883.0 million compared to $860.1 million for 2006. Collectively, the aforementioned changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity earnings contributed to the $22.9 million increase in operating income year-to-year. Interest expense increased $73.7 million year-to-year primarily due to our issuance of junior subordinated notes in the second quarter of 2007 and third quarter of 2006 and the issuance of Senior Notes L in the third quarter of 2007. Our consolidated interest expense for 2007 includes $11.6 million associated with Duncan Energy Partners’ credit facility. Our average debt principal outstanding was $6.26 billion in 2007 compared to $4.93 billion in 2006. Minority interest increased $21.6 million year-to-year attributable to the public unit holders of Duncan Energy Partners and third-party ownership interests in the Independence Hub platform. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, our consolidated net income decreased $67.5 million year-to-year to $533.7 million in 2007 compared to $601.2 million in 2006. Net income for 2006 includes a $1.5 million benefit relating to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. For additional information regarding the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we recorded in 2006, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $812.5 million for 2007 compared to $752.5 million for 2006. Gross operating margin for 2007 includes $32.7 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims compared to $40.4 million of proceeds during 2006. Strong demand for NGLs in 2007 compared to 2006 led to higher natural gas processing margins, increased volumes of natural gas processed under fee-based contracts and higher NGL throughput volumes at certain of our pipelines and fractionation facilities. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding proceeds from business interruption insurance claims. 60 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and storage was $302.2 million for 2007 compared to $265.7 million for 2006. Total NGL transportation volumes increased to 1,666 MBPD during 2007 from 1,577 MBPD during 2006. The $36.5 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher pipeline transportation and NGL storage volumes at certain of our facilities and higher transportation fees charged to shippers on our Mid-America Pipeline System. Our DEP South Texas NGL Pipeline contributed $21.1 million of gross operating margin and 73 MBPD of NGL transportation volumes during 2007. The increase in gross operating margin year-to-year was partially offset by lower volumes and higher costs resulting from the November 2007 rupture of the Dixie Pipeline and a one-time benefit in 2006 for the settlement of a pipeline contamination incident. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business was $389.1 million for 2007 compared to $359.7 million for 2006. The $29.4 million increase in gross operating margin year-to-year is largely due to improved results from our south Texas, Louisiana and Chaco natural gas processing facilities attributable to higher volumes and equity NGL sales revenues. Fee-based processing volumes increased to 2.6 Bcf/d during 2007 from 2.2 Bcf/d during 2006. Equity NGL production increased to 88 MBPD during 2007 from 63 MBPD during 2006. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin from this business was partially offset by expenses associated with start-up delays at our Meeker and Pioneer natural gas processing plants. The start-up delays at both our Meeker and Pioneer facilities are attributable to the replacement of defective high pressure valves and the need to address third-party engineering design problems. We are actively engaged in efforts to obtain recovery for certain of our losses. During 2007, we entered into transactions to economically hedge a percentage of the expected NGL production at these facilities, which entailed the physical forward sale of NGLs and the purchase of natural gas. As a result of the unexpected downtime at our Meeker facility and the delayed start-up of our Pioneer facility, the actual NGL production and natural gas consumption during the fourth quarter of 2007 was less than the volume we hedged. The cost to replace the defective valves and the expense resulting from a non-cash, mark-to-market charge on the short, or over hedged, NGL balance and the liquidation of the long natural gas position totaled $30.0 million during 2007. Gross operating margin generated by our Meeker facility from actual production was offset by a decrease in gross operating margin from our NGL marketing business. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation was $88.4 million for 2007 compared to $86.8 million for 2006. Fractionation volumes increased from 312 MBPD during 2006 to 394 MBPD during 2007. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin of $1.6 million is primarily due to higher volumes at our Norco NGL fractionator during 2007 relative to 2006. Our Norco NGL fractionator returned to normal operating rates in the second quarter of 2006 after suffering a reduction of fractionation volumes due to the effects of Hurricane Katrina. Gross operating margin attributable to our Hobbs NGL fractionator, which became operational in August 2007, was largely offset by start-up expenses. Fractionation volumes for 2007 include 36 MBPD from our Hobbs fractionator. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $335.7 million for 2007 compared to $333.4 million for 2006. Our total onshore natural gas transportation volumes were 6,632 BBtu/d for 2007 compared to 6,012 BBtu/d for 2006. Gross operating margin from our onshore natural gas pipeline business was $307.2 million for 2007 compared to $312.3 million for 2006. The $5.1 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin from this business is largely due to higher operating costs on our Acadian Gas System, Waha and Carlsbad Gathering Systems and our Texas Intrastate System. Results from our onshore natural gas pipeline business for 2007 include $5.5 million of gross operating margin from our Piceance Creek Gathering System, which we acquired in December 2006. Equity earnings from our investment in Jonah increased $9.1 million year-to-year. The Piceance Creek Gathering System and our net share of the gathering volumes on the Jonah Gathering System contributed 789 BBtu/d, collectively, of natural gas gathering volumes during 2007. Gross operating margin from our natural gas storage business was $28.4 million for 2007 compared to $21.1 million for 2006. The $7.3 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is 61 Table of Contents largely due to improved results from our Wilson natural gas storage facility attributable to lower repair costs in 2007 relative to 2006 and a 2006 loss on the sale of cushion gas. All repairs are now complete on the three storage wells at our Wilson facility that were taken out of service in the second quarter of 2006. We are in the process of dewatering the caverns and returning working gas storage capacity to service, which should be largely complete in the second quarter of 2008. Gross operating margin from our Petal facility includes an $8.4 million benefit in 2006 for a well measurement gain. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $171.6 million for 2007 compared to $103.4 million for 2006, a year-to-year increase of $68.2 million. Our Independence project contributed $85.0 million of gross operating margin during 2007 on average natural gas throughput of 423 BBtus/d. Segment gross operating margin for 2007 includes $3.4 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims compared to $23.5 million of proceeds in 2006. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding proceeds from business interruption insurance claims. Gross operating margin from our offshore platform services business was $111.7 million for 2007 compared to $34.6 million for 2006. The $77.1 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to our start up of the Independence Hub Platform in 2007, which contributed $63.6 million of gross operating margin in 2007. In addition, gross operating margin from this business increased $13.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher volumes during 2007 versus 2006. Our net platform natural gas processing volumes increased to 494 MMcf/d in 2007 from 159 MMcf/d in 2006. Gross operating margin from our offshore natural gas pipeline business was $35.4 million for 2007 compared to $22.4 million for 2006. Offshore natural gas transportation volumes were 1,641 BBtu/d during 2007 versus 1,520 BBtu/d during 2006. Our Independence Trail Pipeline reported $21.4 million of gross operating margin and 423 BBtus/d of transportation volumes for 2007. Results from our Independence Trail Pipeline were partially offset by a decrease in volumes and revenues from our Viosca Knoll Gathering System and Constitution Gas Pipeline. Gross operating margin for 2007 includes a non-cash impairment charge of $7.0 million associated with our investment in Nemo compared to charge of $7.4 million in 2006 related to our investment in Neptune. Gross operating margin from our offshore crude oil pipeline business was $21.1 million for 2007 versus $23.0 million for 2006. The $1.9 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is primarily due to lower transportation volumes on our certain of our offshore crude oil pipelines and higher operating costs on our Poseidon Oil Pipeline System during 2007 relative to 2006. An increase in revenues year-to-year on our Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System attributable to higher volumes was more than offset by a one-time expense of $8.8 million associated with the early termination of Cameron Highway’s credit facility. Crude oil transportation volumes on our Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System net to our ownership interest were 44 MBPD during 2007 compared to 32 MBPD during 2006. Total offshore crude oil transportation volumes were 163 MBPD during 2007 versus 153 MBPD during 2006. BP P.L.C. announced in December 2007 that crude oil and natural gas production from its Atlantis Development had commenced. Crude oil volumes from this development are transported on our Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System. Natural gas production from the Atlantis development is transported on our Manta Ray Gathering System and Nautilus Pipeline and processed at our Neptune facility. Recovered NGLs are fractionated at our Promix fractionator. Petrochemical Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $172.3 million for 2007 compared to $173.1 million for 2006. Gross operating margin from our butane isomerization business was $91.4 million for 2007 compared to $73.2 million for 2006. The $18.2 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is attributable to higher processing volumes and by-products sales revenues. Butane isomerization volumes were 90 MBPD for 2007 compared to 81 MBPD for 2006. Gross operating margin from our propylene fractionation and pipeline activities was $62.6 million for 2007 versus $63.4 million for 2006. The $0.8 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is primarily attributable to higher operating costs and expenses attributable to our propylene pipelines and 62 Table of Contents our propylene storage and export facility. Petrochemical transportation volumes were 105 MBPD during 2007 compared to 97 MBPD during 2006. Gross operating margin from octane enhancement was $18.3 million for 2007 compared to $36.6 million for 2006. The year-to-year decrease of $18.3 million is primarily due to lower sales margins in 2007 relative to 2006. Octane enhancement production was 9 MBPD during 2007 and 2006. Comparison of 2006 with 2005 Revenues for 2006 were $13.99 billion compared to $12.26 billion for 2005. The increase in consolidated revenues year-to-year is primarily due to higher sales volumes and energy commodity prices in 2006 relative to 2005. These factors accounted for a $1.72 billion increase in consolidated revenues associated with our marketing activities. Revenues for 2006 include $63.9 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims compared to $4.8 million of proceeds for 2005. Operating costs and expenses were $13.09 billion for 2006 versus $11.55 billion for 2005. The year-to-year increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses is primarily due to an increase in the cost of sales associated with our marketing activities. The cost of sales of our NGL and petrochemical products increased $1.21 billion year-to-year as a result of an increase in volumes and higher energy commodity prices. Operating costs and expenses associated with our natural gas processing plants increased $258.7 million as a result of higher energy commodity prices in 2006 relative to 2005. General and administrative costs increased $1.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher costs associated with FERC rate case filings for our Mid-America Pipeline System and Texas Intrastate System. Changes in our revenues and costs and expenses year-to-year are explained in part by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $1.00 per gallon during 2006 versus $0.91 per gallon during 2005, a year-to-year increase of 10%. The Henry Hub market price of natural gas averaged $7.24 per MMBtu during 2006 versus $8.64 per MMBtu during 2005. Polymer grade and refinery grade propylene index prices increased 12% year-to-year. Equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates were $21.6 million for 2006 compared to $14.5 million for 2005. An increase in volumes from offshore production led to a collective $11.8 million increase year-to-year in equity earnings from Poseidon and Deepwater Gateway. Equity earnings from Cameron Highway increased $4.9 million year-to-year. Our equity earnings for 2005 included an $11.5 million charge associated with the refinancing of Cameron Highway’s project finance debt. Also, equity earnings from our investment in Neptune decreased $10.3 million year-to-year primarily due to a $7.4 million non-cash impairment charged recorded in 2006 associated with this investment. Operating income for 2006 was $860.1 million compared to $663.0 million for 2005. Collectively, the aforementioned changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity earnings contributed to the $197.1 million increase in operating income year-to-year. Interest expense increased $7.5 million year-to-year primarily due to our issuance of junior notes in 2006 and an increase in interest rates charged on our variable rate debt. Our average debt principal outstanding was $4.93 billion in 2006 compared to $4.63 billion in 2005. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, our consolidated net income increased $181.6 million year-to-year to $601.2 million in 2006 compared to $419.5 million in 2005. Net income for both years includes the recognition of non-cash amounts related to the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. We recorded a $1.5 million benefit in 2006 and a $4.2 million charge in 2005 related to such changes. For additional information regarding the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles we recorded in 2006 and 2005, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 63 Table of Contents The following information highlights significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $752.5 million for 2006 compared to $579.7 million for 2005. Gross operating margin for 2006 includes $40.4 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims compared to $4.8 million of proceeds during 2005. Strong demand for NGLs in 2006 compared to 2005 led to higher natural gas processing margins, increased volumes of natural gas processed under fee-based contracts and higher NGL throughput volumes at certain of our pipelines and fractionation facilities. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding proceeds from business interruption proceeds. Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and storage was $265.7 million for 2006 compared to $205.0 million for 2005. Total NGL transportation volumes increased to 1,577 MBPD during 2006 from 1,478 MBPD during 2005. The $60.7 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher NGL transportation and storage volumes at certain of our facilities and the affects of a higher average transportation rate charged to shippers on our Mid-America pipeline. Also, segment gross operating margin in 2006 from our Dixie pipeline system benefited from lower pipeline integrity and maintenance costs year-to-year and the settlement of claims associated with a pipeline contamination incident in 2005. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business was $359.6 million for 2006 compared to $308.5 million for 2005. The $51.1 million increase in gross operating margin year-to-year is largely due to improved results from our south Texas and Louisiana natural gas processing facilities, which benefited from strong demand for NGLs, a favorable processing environment and higher levels of offshore natural gas production available for processing. Fee-based processing volumes increased to 2.2 Bcf/d during 2006 from 1.8 Bcf/d during 2005. Lastly, gross operating margin from natural gas processing for 2006 includes $9.6 million from processing contracts we acquired in connection with the Encinal acquisition in July 2006 and $9.4 million from the Pioneer facility, which we acquired from TEPPCO in March 2006. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation was $86.8 million for 2006 compared to $61.5 million for 2005. Fractionation volumes increased from 292 MBPD during 2005 to 312 MBPD during 2006. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin of $25.3 million is largely due to increased fractionation volumes at our Norco NGL fractionator. This facility suffered a reduction of volumes in the second half of 2005 due to the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Also, our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionator benefited from a 15 MBPD expansion project that was completed during the second quarter of 2006. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $333.4 million for 2006 compared to $353.1 million for 2005. Our total onshore natural gas transportation volumes were 6,012 BBtu/d during 2006 compared to 5,916 BBtu/d for 2005. A $24.7 million increase in segment gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System year-to-year was more than offset by lower gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System and Wilson natural gas storage facility. Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System increased to $117.7 million for 2006 from $93 million for 2005 due to higher transportation fees and lower operating costs year-to-year. Segment gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System decreased $26.7 million year-to-year attributable to lower revenues from certain gathering contracts in which the fees are based on an index price for natural gas. Average index prices for natural gas were significantly higher during 2005 relative to 2006 due to supply interruptions and higher regional demand caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Natural gas gathering volumes for the San Juan Gathering System were 1,192 BBtu/d for 2006 and 1,186 BBtu/d for 2005. In addition, gross operating margin from this segment decreased $21.9 million year-to-year as a result of mechanical problems associated with three storage caverns located at our Wilson natural gas 64 Table of Contents storage facility in Texas, which caused these wells to be taken out of service for most of 2006. This includes $7.9 million in losses associated with the sale of cushion gas from these wells. Lastly, gross operating margin for 2006 includes $1.8 million from the Encinal natural gas gathering system that we acquired in July 2006. The Encinal natural gas gathering system contributed 89 BBtu/d of gathering volumes during 2006. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $103.4 million for 2006 compared to $77.5 million for 2005. Segment gross operating margin for 2006 includes $23.5 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims. As a result of industry losses associated with these storms, insurance costs for offshore operations have increased dramatically. Insurance costs for our offshore assets were $21.6 million for 2006 compared to $6.5 million for 2005. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding proceeds from business interruption proceeds. Gross operating margin from our offshore crude oil pipelines was $23.0 million for 2006 versus $0.3 million for 2005. Our Marco Polo and Poseidon oil pipelines posted higher crude oil transportation volumes during 2006 due to increased production activity by our customers. Collectively, gross operating margin from the Marco Polo and Poseidon oil pipelines improved $10.1 million year-to-year. Our Constitution Oil Pipeline, which was placed into service during the first quarter of 2006, contributed $8.8 million to segment gross operating margin during 2006. Total offshore crude oil transportation volumes were 153 MBPD during 2006 versus 127 MBPD during 2005. Gross operating margin from our offshore natural gas pipelines was $22.4 million for 2006 compared to $37.1 million for 2005. Offshore natural gas transportation volumes were 1,520 BBtu/d during 2006 versus 1,780 BBtu/d during 2005. The $14.7 million decrease in gross operating margin year-to-year is largely due to increased insurance costs and a non-cash impairment charge of $7.4 million recorded in 2006 associated with our investment in Neptune. Also, 2006 includes gross operating margin of $8.4 million and transportation volumes of 50 BBtu/d from the Constitution natural gas pipeline, which was placed in service during the first quarter of 2006. Gross operating margin from our offshore platforms was $34.5 million for 2006 compared to $40.1 million for 2005. The decrease in gross operating margin year-to-year is primarily due to reduced offshore production during 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Equity earnings from Deepwater Gateway, which owns the Marco Polo platform, increased $7.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher processing volumes. Petrochemical Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $173.1 million for 2006 compared to $126.1 million for 2005. The $47.0 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to improved results from our octane enhancement business attributable to higher isooctane sales volumes and prices. Gross operating margin from this business was $36.6 million for 2006 compared to $3.6 million for 2005. Isooctane, a high octane, low vapor pressure motor gasoline additive, complements the increasing use of ethanol, which has a high vapor pressure. Our isooctane production facility commenced operations in the second quarter of 2005. Gross operating margin from our propylene fractionation and pipeline activities was $63.4 million for 2006 versus $55.9 million for 2005. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin of $7.5 million is primarily due to improved polymer grade propylene sales prices and volumes and the addition of the Texas City refinery-grade propylene pipeline, which we completed during 2005. Petrochemical transportation volumes were 97 MBPD during 2006 compared to 64 MBPD during 2005. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization was $73.2 million for 2006 compared to $66.6 million for 2005. The year-to-year increase of $6.6 million is primarily due to higher processing fees and lower fuel costs. Butane isomerization volumes were 81 MBPD during 2006 and 2005. 65 Table of Contents General Outlook for 2008 We are currently in a major asset construction phase that began in 2005. Fiscal 2007 was a transitional year as we completed construction of several major projects and placed them into service for a portion of 2007. These projects included the Independence Hub platform and Trail pipeline, Meeker natural gas processing plant, Hobbs NGL fractionator, expansion of Mid-America NGL pipeline and a new propylene fractionator at Mont Belvieu. Additionally, in February 2008, we placed the Pioneer cryogenic natural gas processing plant in service. In 2008, we expect these major projects to contribute significant new sources of revenue, operating income and cash flow from operations as volumes increase to these facilities. During the second half of 2008, construction of additional growth projects should be completed; placed in service and begin to contribute new sources of revenue, operating income and cash flow from operations. These include the expansion of the Meeker natural gas processing plant, Exxon central treating facility and the Sherman Extension natural gas pipeline. We are continuing to work to expand our relationships with existing customers and pursue service agreements with new customers that would provide additional volumes to both our existing and newly constructed assets. Based on current general and industry economic conditions, § We believe that drilling and production activities in the major producing areas where we operate, including the Gulf of Mexico and supply basins in Texas, San Juan and the Rocky Mountains, could result in increased demand for our midstream energy services. As a result, we expect higher transportation and processing volumes for certain of our existing and newly constructed assets due to increased natural gas, NGL and crude oil production from both onshore and offshore producing areas. § We expect the volume of natural gas and NGLs available to our facilities in Texas to increase as a result of drilling activity and long-term agreements executed with new customers. We expect natural gas transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System to increase during 2008 as we supply the Houston, Texas area with natural gas volumes under a long-term agreement with CenterPoint Energy and begin operations on the Sherman Extension pipeline in the Barnett Shale region of North Texas in the fourth quarter of 2008. § We believe that the current strength of the domestic and global economies should continue to drive increased demand for all forms of energy despite fluctuating commodity prices. Our largest NGL consuming customers in the ethylene industry continue to see strong demand for their products. Ethane and propane continue to be the preferred feedstocks for the ethylene industry due to the higher cost of crude oil derivatives. § Longer term, we believe the expansion of crude oil refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast could result in opportunities to provide additional midstream services through our existing assets and support the construction of new pipeline and storage facilities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses and debt service, are for working capital, capital expenditures, business acquisitions and distributions to our partners. We expect to fund our short-term needs for such items as operating expenses and sustaining capital expenditures with operating cash flows and short-term revolving credit arrangements. Capital expenditures for long-term needs resulting from internal growth projects and business acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources (either separately or in combination) including net cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings under credit facilities, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities and proceeds from divestitures of ownership interest in assets to affiliates or third parties. We expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash flows. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and/or refinancing arrangements. 66 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007, we had $39.7 million of unrestricted cash on hand and approximately $1.02 billion of available credit under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In total, we had approximately $6.90 billion in principal outstanding under consolidated debt agreements at December 31, 2007. For detailed information regarding our consolidated debt obligations and those of our unconsolidated affiliates, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. As a result of our growth objectives, we expect to access debt and equity capital markets from time-to-time and we believe that financing arrangements to support our growth activities can be obtained on reasonable terms. Furthermore, we believe that maintenance of an investment grade credit rating combined with continued ready access to debt and equity capital at reasonable rates and sufficient trade credit to operate our businesses efficiently provide a solid foundation to meet our long and short-term liquidity and capital resource requirements. Registration Statements We may issue equity or debt securities to assist us in meeting our liquidity and capital spending requirements. Duncan Energy Partners may do likewise in meeting its liquidity and capital spending requirements. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and EPO have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that would allow these entities to issue an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities for general partnership purposes. During 2003, we instituted a distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”). We have a registration statement on file with the SEC covering the issuance of up to 25,000,000 common units in connection with the DRIP. The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they would otherwise receive into the purchase of additional common units. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we issued 1,923,640 common units in connection with our DRIP, which generated proceeds of $56.3 million from plan participants. We also have a registration statement on file related to our employee unit purchase plan, under which we can issue up to 1,200,000 common units. Under this plan, employees of EPCO can purchase our common units at a 10% discount through payroll deductions. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we issued 132,975 common units to employees under this plan, which generated proceeds of $4.0 million. In February 2007, Duncan Energy Partners completed its initial public offering of 14,950,000 common units, the majority of proceeds from which were distributed to us. Duncan Energy Partners may issue additional amounts of equity in the future in connection with other acquisitions. For additional information regarding Duncan Energy Partners, see “Other Items — Initial Public Offering of Duncan Energy Partners” within this Item 7. For information regarding our public debt obligations or partnership equity, see Notes 14 and 15, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Credit Ratings of EPO At February 1, 2008, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s debt securities were Baa3 by Moody’s Investor Services; BBB- by Fitch Ratings; and BBB- by Standard and Poor’s. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it determines that the circumstances warrant such a change and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Based on the characteristics of the $1.25 billion of fixed/floating unsecured junior subordinated notes that EPO issued in 2006 and 2007, the rating agencies assigned partial equity treatment to the notes. 67 Table of Contents Moody’s Investor Services and Standard and Poor’s each assigned 50% equity treatment and Fitch Ratings assigned 75% equity treatment. In connection with the construction of our Pascagoula, Mississippi natural gas processing plant, EPO entered into a $54 million, ten-year, fixed-rate loan with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation (“MBFC”). The indenture agreement for this loan contains an acceleration clause whereby if EPO’s credit rating by Moody’s Investor Services declines below Baa3 in combination with our credit rating at Standard & Poor’s declining below BBB-, the $54.0 million principal balance of this loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest would become immediately due and payable 120 days following such event. If such an event occurred, EPO would have to either redeem the Pascagoula MBFC Loan or provide an alternative credit agreement to support its obligation under this loan. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands). For information regarding the individual components of our cash flow amounts, see the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Item 8 of this annual report. For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 1,590,941 $ 1,175,069 $ 631,708 Cash used in investing activities 2,533,607 1,689,288 1,130,395 Cash provided by financing activities 979,355 494,972 516,229 Net cash flows provided by operating activities is largely dependent on earnings from our business activities. As a result, these cash flows are exposed to certain risks. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry. We provide services for producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. The products that we process, sell or transport are principally used as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating; feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing; and in the production of motor gasoline. Reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers, whether because of general economic conditions, reduced demand for the end products made with our products or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons could have a negative impact on our earnings and thus the availability of cash from operating activities. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Item 1A of this annual report. Our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method. The indirect method derives net cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income to remove (i) the effects of all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments, such as changes during the period in inventory, deferred income and similar transactions, (ii) the effects of all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and cash payments, such as changes during the period in receivables and payables, (iii) the effects of all items classified as investing or financing cash flows, such as gains or losses on sale of property, plant and equipment or extinguishment of debt, and (iv) other non-cash amounts such as depreciation, amortization, operating lease expense paid by EPCO and changes in the fair market value of financial instruments. Equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates is also a non-cash item that must be removed in determining net cash provided by operating activities. Our cash flows from operating activities reflect the actual cash distributions we receive from such investees. In general, the net effect of changes in operating accounts results from the timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for purchases and other expenses during each period. Increases or decreases in inventory are influenced by the quantity of products held in connection with our marketing activities and changes in energy commodity prices. Cash used in investing activities primarily represents expenditures for capital projects, business combinations, asset purchases and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Cash provided by (or used in) 68 Table of Contents financing activities generally consists of borrowings and repayments of debt, distributions to partners and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities. Amounts presented in our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for borrowings and repayments under debt agreements are influenced by the magnitude of cash receipts and payments under our revolving credit facilities. The following information highlights the significant year-to-year variances in our cash flow amounts: Comparison of 2007 with 2006 Operating activities. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $1.59 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1.18 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. § Our net cash flows from consolidated businesses (excluding cash payments for interest and taxes and distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates) increased $436.9 million year-to-year. The improvement in cash flow is generally due to increased gross operating margin (see “Results of Operations” within this Item 7) and the timing of related cash collections and disbursements between periods. The $436.9 million year-to-year increase also includes a $42.1 million increase in cash proceeds we received from insurance claims related to certain named storms. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding insurance matters. § Cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates increased $30.6 million year-to-year primarily due to improved earnings from our Gulf of Mexico investments, which were negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the lingering effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. § Cash payments for interest increased $56.2 million year-to-year primarily due to increased borrowings to finance our capital spending program. Our average debt balance for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $6.26 billion compared to $4.93 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. § Cash payments for federal and state income taxes decreased $4.7 million year-to-year. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $2.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1.69 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $864.3 million year-to-year increase in cash outflows is primarily due to an $847.7 million increase in capital spending for property, plant and equipment and a $194.6 million increase in investments in unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by a $240.7 million decrease in cash outlays for business combinations. For additional information related to our capital spending for property, plant and equipment, see “Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. During the year ended December 31, 2007 we contributed $216.5 million to an unconsolidated affiliate, Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (“Cameron Highway”). In return, Cameron Highway used these funds, along with an equal contribution from our 50% joint venture partner in Cameron Highway, to repay its $430.0 million in outstanding debt. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we paid $100.0 million for a 100% interest in Piceance Creek Pipeline, LLC and paid Lewis Energy Group, L.P. (“Lewis”) $145.2 million in cash in connection with the Encinal acquisition. Our spending for business combinations during the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily limited to the $35.0 million we paid to acquire the South Monco pipeline business. Financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $979.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus $495.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The following information highlights significant factors that influenced the $484.4 million year-to-year change in cash provided by financing activities: § Net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements increased $1.10 billion year-to-year. In May 2007, EPO sold $700.0 million in principal amount of fixed/floating unsecured junior subordinated notes (Junior Notes B”). In September 2007, EPO sold $800.0 million in principal 69 Table of Contents amount of fixed-rate unsecured senior notes (“Senior Notes L”) and in October 2007, EPO repaid $500.0 million in principal amount of Senior Notes E. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Net proceeds from the issuance of our common units decreased $788.0 million year-to-year. We had underwritten equity offerings in March and September of 2006 that generated net proceeds of $750.8 million reflecting the sale of 31,050,000 common units. § Contributions from minority interests increased $275.4 million year-to-year primarily due to the initial public offering of Duncan Energy Partners in February 2007, which generated net proceeds of $290.5 million from the sale of 14,950,000 of its common units. See “Other Items — Initial Public Offering of Duncan Energy Partners” within this Item 7 for additional information regarding this offering. § Cash distributions to our partners increased $137.9 million year-to-year due to an increase in common units outstanding and our quarterly cash distribution rates. § We received $48.9 million from the settlement of treasury lock contracts during the year ended December 31, 2007 related to our interest rate hedging activities. Comparison of 2006 with 2005 Operating activities. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $1.18 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $631.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. § Our net cash flows from consolidated businesses (excluding cash payments for interest and taxes and distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates) increased $569.6 million year-to-year. The improvement in cash flow is generally due to increased earnings (see “Results of Operations” within this Item 7) and the timing of related cash collections and disbursements between periods. The $569.6 million year-to-year increase also includes a $93.7 million increase in cash proceeds we received from insurance claims related to certain named storms. § Cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $13.0 million year-to-year primarily due to the lingering effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on our Gulf of Mexico investments during the year ended December 31, 2006. § Cash payments for interest increased $7.9 million year-to-year. Our average debt balance for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $4.93 billion compared to $4.63 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. § Cash payments for federal and state income taxes increased $5.3 million year-to-year. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. Our cash outlays for business combinations were $276.5 million in 2006 versus $326.6 million in 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we paid $100.0 million for a 100% interest in Piceance Creek Pipeline, LLC and paid Lewis $145.2 million in cash in connection with the Encinal acquisition. Our cash outlay for acquisitions during 2005 included (i) $145.5 million for storage assets purchased from Ferrellgas LP, (ii) $74.9 million for indirect interests in certain East Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets, (iii) $68.6 million for additional ownership interests in Dixie and (iv) $25.0 million for the remaining ownership interests in our Mid-America Pipeline System and an additional interest in the Seminole Pipeline. Proceeds from the sale of assets during 2005 include $42.1 million from the sale of our investment in Starfish Pipeline Company, LLC (“Starfish”). We were required to divest our ownership interest in this entity by the Federal Trade Commission in order to gain its approval for our merger with GulfTerra Energy Partners, L.P. in September 2004. In addition, we received $47.5 million as a return of our investment in 70 Table of Contents Cameron Highway in June 2005. As a result of refinancing its project debt, Cameron Highway was authorized by its lenders to make this special distribution. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates were $138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $87.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The 2006 period includes $120.1 million we invested to date in the Phase V expansion project of Jonah. The 2005 period primarily reflects $72.0 million we contributed to Deepwater Gateway to fund our share of the repayment of its construction loan in March 2005. For additional information related to our capital spending program, see “Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. Financing activities Cash provided by financing activities was $495.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $516.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. As a result of our capital spending program, we utilized EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility in varying degrees throughout 2006. During 2006, we applied all or a portion of the net proceeds from equity and debt offerings to reduce debt outstanding. We used $430 million of net proceeds from our March 2006 equity offering and $260 million of net proceeds from our September 2006 equity offering to temporarily reduce amounts due under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. We also used the net proceeds from the EPO’s issuance of Junior Subordinated Notes A in the third quarter of 2006 to reduce debt outstanding under this facility. We used any remaining net proceeds from these offerings in 2006 for general partnership purposes. During 2005, our EPO issued an aggregate of $1 billion in senior notes, the proceeds of which were used to repay $350.0 million due under Senior Notes A, to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under our bank credit facilities and for general partnership purposes. Additionally, we repaid the remaining $242.2 million that was due under EPO’s 364-Day Acquisition Credit Facility (which was used to finance elements of the GulfTerra Merger) using proceeds generated from our February 2005 equity offering. Net proceeds from the issuance of our limited partner interests were $857.2 million for 2006 compared to $646.9 million for 2005. With respect to equity offerings (including sales through our distribution reinvestment program and employee unit purchase plan), we issued 34,824,649 common units 2006 versus 23,979,740 common units during 2005. Net proceeds from underwritten equity offerings were $750.8 million during 2006 reflecting the sale of 31,050,000 common units and $555.5 million during 2005 reflecting the sale of 21,250,000 common units. Our distribution reinvestment program and related employee unit purchase plan generated net proceeds of $96.9 million during 2006, including $50 million reinvested by EPCO. In comparison, this program generated proceeds of $69.7 million during 2005, including $30 million reinvested by EPCO. Cash distributions to partners increased from $716.7 million during 2005 to $843.3 million during 2006. The year-to-year increase in cash distributions is due to an increase in common units outstanding and quarterly cash distribution rates. Cash contributions from minority interests were $27.6 million for 2006 compared to $39.1 million for 2005. Capital Spending An integral part of our business strategy involves expansion through business combinations, growth capital projects and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are positioned to continue to grow our system of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas and/or crude oil production from resource basins such as the Piceance Basin of western Colorado, the Greater Green River Basin in Wyoming, Barnett Shale in North Texas, and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Management continues to analyze potential acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. In recent years, major oil and gas companies have sold non-strategic assets in the midstream energy sector in which we operate. We 71 Table of Contents forecast that this trend will continue, and expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestitures. The following table summarizes our capital spending by activity for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Capital spending for business combinations: Encinal acquisition, excluding non-cash consideration (1) $ 114 $ 145,197 $ — Piceance Basin Gathering System acquisition 368 100,000 — South Monco Pipeline System acquisition 35,000 — — Canadian Enterprise Gas Products acquisition — 17,690 — NGL underground storage and terminalling assets purchased from Ferrellgas — — 145,522 Indirect interests in the Indian Springs natural gas gathering and processing assets — — 74,854 Additional ownership interests in Dixie Pipeline Company (“Dixie”) 311 12,913 68,608 Additional ownership interests in Mid-America and Seminole pipeline systems — — 25,000 Other business combinations — 700 12,618 Total 35,793 276,500 326,602 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net: (2) Growth capital projects (3) 1,986,157 1,148,123 719,372 Sustaining capital projects (4) 142,096 132,455 98,077 Total 2,128,253 1,280,578 817,449 Capital spending for intangible assets: Acquisition of intangible assets 11,232 — — Total 11,232 — — Capital spending attributable to unconsolidated affiliates: Investments in unconsolidated affiliates (5) 343,009 127,422 88,044 Total 343,009 127,422 88,044 Total capital spending $ 2,518,287 $ 1,684,500 $ 1,232,095 (1) Excludes $181.1 million of non-cash consideration paid to the seller in the form of 7,115,844 of our common units. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our business combinations. (2) On certain of our capital projects, third parties are obligated to reimburse us for all or a portion of project expenditures. The majority of such arrangements are associated with projects related to pipeline construction and production well tie-ins. Contributions in aid of construction costs were $57.5 million, $60.5 million and $47.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (3) Growth capital projects either result in additional revenue streams from existing assets or expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams. (4) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to and major renewals of existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues. (5) Fiscal 2007 includes $216.5 million in cash contributions to Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (“Cameron Highway”) to fund our share of the repayment of its debt obligations. Based on information currently available, we estimate our consolidated capital spending for 2008 will approximate $1.7 billion, which includes estimated expenditures of $1.5 billion for growth capital projects and acquisitions and $0.2 billion for sustaining capital expenditures. Our forecast of consolidated capital expenditures is based on our current strategic operating and growth plans, which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or from other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, issuance of equity, and potential divestitures of certain assets to third and/or related parties. Our forecast of capital expenditures may change due to factors beyond our control, such as weather related issues, changes in supplier prices or adverse economic conditions. Furthermore, our forecast may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include acquisitions or decisions to take on additional partners. 72 Table of Contents Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a principal factor that determines how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future operating growth needs, and although we currently intend to make the forecasted expenditures discussed above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital markets. At December 31, 2007, we had approximately $569.7 million in purchase commitments outstanding that relate to our capital spending for property, plant and equipment. These commitments primarily relate to construction of our Barnett Shale natural gas pipeline project and Meeker and Pioneer natural gas processing plants. Significant Ongoing Growth Capital Projects The following table summarizes information regarding our current significant growth capital projects as of February 1, 2008 (dollars in millions). The capital spending amount noted for each project at December 31, 2007 includes accrued expenditures and capitalized interest as of this date. The forecast amount noted for each project includes a provision for estimated capitalized interest. Actual Current Estimated Costs Through Forecast Date of December 31, Total Project Name Completion 2007 Cost Pioneer II natural gas processing plant First Quarter 2008 $ 279.9 $ 360.2 Expansion of Petal natural gas storage facility Second Quarter 2008 65.3 96.5 Meeker II natural gas processing plant Third Quarter 2008 137.5 399.5 Sherman Extension Pipeline (Barnett Shale) Fourth Quarter 2008 30.9 477.9 ExxonMobil Conditioning & Treating Facility — Piceance Basin Fourth Quarter 2008 122.3 195.4 Mont Belvieu Storage Well Optimization Projects Fourth Quarter 2008 131.0 180.5 Shenzi Oil Pipeline 2009 76.2 171.2 Marathon Piceance Basin pipeline projects 2009 3.3 114.8 Expansion of Wilson natural gas storage facility 2010 2.4 113.7 Pioneer cryogenic natural gas processing plant. In July 2006, we began construction of a cryogenic natural gas processing plant located adjacent to the silica gel plant we acquired from TEPPCO in March 2006 and subsequently expanded. The Pioneer cryogenic facility commenced operations in February 2008. This new facility has a processing capacity of 750 MMcf/d and can handle expected production growth from the Jonah and Pinedale fields located in the Greater Green River Basin in Wyoming. At full rates, the Pioneer cryogenic facility is expected to recover up to 30 MBPD of NGLs. Expansion of Petal natural gas storage facility. We are developing a new natural gas storage cavern located on the Petal Salt Dome near Petal, Mississippi. The cavern is designed to store approximately 7.9 Bcf of natural gas, of which approximately 5.0 Bcf will be working gas capacity and 2.9 Bcf will be the base gas requirements needed to support minimum pressures. This expansion project was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and is projected to commence operations during the second quarter of 2008. We have long-term, binding precedent agreements on the majority of the capacity. Meeker II natural gas processing plant. In October 2007, we commenced natural gas processing operations at our Meeker I facility, which recently completed its first phase of construction. Located in Colorado’s Piceance Basin, our Meeker I facility has a processing capacity of 750 MMcf/d of natural gas and is capable of extracting up to 35 MBPD of mixed NGLs. The Meeker II facility, which is under construction and expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2008, will double its processing capacity to 1.5 Bcf/d of natural gas and 70 MBPD of mixed NGLs. Sherman Extension Pipeline (Barnett Shale). In November 2006, we announced an expansion of our Texas Intrastate System with the construction of the Sherman Extension that will transport up to 1.1 Bcf/d of natural gas from the growing Barnett Shale area of North Texas. The Sherman Extension is 73 Table of Contents supported by long-term contracts with Devon Energy Corporation, the largest producer in the Barnett Shale area, and significant indications of interest from leading producers and gatherers in the Fort Worth basin, as well as other shippers on our Texas Intrastate Pipeline system. At its terminus, the new pipeline system will make deliveries into Boardwalk Pipeline Partners L.P.’s (“Boardwalk”) Gulf Crossing Expansion Project, which will provide export capacity for Barnett Shale natural gas production to multiple delivery points in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama that offer access to attractive markets in the Northeast and Southeast United States. In addition, the Sherman Extension will provide natural gas producers in East Texas and the Waha area of West Texas with access to these higher value markets through our Texas Intrastate Pipeline system. The Sherman Extension will originate near Morgan Mill, Texas and extend through the center of the current Barnett Shale development area to Sherman, Texas. The Barnett Shale is considered to be one of the largest unconventional natural gas resource plays in North America, covering approximately 14 counties and over seven million acres in the Fort Worth basin in North Texas. Current natural gas production is estimated at 3.4 Bcf/d from approximately 7,800 wells. Approximately 190 rigs are currently estimated to be working to develop Barnett Shale acreage in the region. According to the United States Geological Survey, the Barnett Shale has the resource potential of approximately 26 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. ExxonMobil Conditioning & Treating Facility — Piceance Basin. In November 2006, we entered into a 30-year agreement with Exxon Mobil Corporation (“ExxonMobil”) to provide gathering, compression, treating and conditioning services for natural gas produced from its Piceance Creek Development Project, which encompasses more than 29,000 acres in Rio Blanco County, Colorado. Under terms of the agreement, ExxonMobil dedicated all of its natural gas production from this development to us for processing. To provide these services, we are constructing new plant and pipeline facilities to compress the natural gas, treat it to remove impurities, extract NGLs, and deliver the gas to various pipeline transmission systems that serve the region. Mont Belvieu Storage Well Optimization Projects. These projects are designed to improve our ability and efficiency of storing and handling NGLs and other products at our Mont Belvieu Caverns underground storage facility. These projects include new pipelines that interconnect our three storage facilities in Mont Belvieu (i.e. East, West and North locations) as well as a brine pipeline that interconnects our various above ground storage pits. Also included in this effort are several infrastructure related projects that will allow us to handle higher inbound and outbound NGL injection rates into and out of the caverns. In general this series of projects should allow us to better utilize our current asset base and allow for future growth. Shenzi Oil Pipeline. In October 2006, we announced the execution of definitive agreements with producers to construct, own and operate an oil export pipeline that will provide firm gathering services from the BHP Billiton Plc-operated Shenzi production field located in the South Green Canyon area of the central Gulf of Mexico. The Shenzi oil export pipeline will originate at the Shenzi Field, located in 4,300 feet of water at Green Canyon Block 653, approximately 120 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The 83-mile, 20-inch diameter pipeline will have the capacity to transport up to 230 MBPD of crude oil and will connect the Shenzi Field to our Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline and Poseidon Oil Pipeline System at our Ship Shoal 332B junction platform. We own a 50% interest in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline and a 36% interest in the Poseidon Oil Pipeline System and operate both pipelines. The Shenzi oil export pipeline will connect to a platform being constructed by BHP Billiton Plc to develop the Shenzi Field, which is expected to begin production in mid-2009. Marathon Piceance Basin pipeline projects. In December 2006, we entered into a long-term contract with Marathon Oil Company (“Marathon”) to provide a range of midstream energy services, including natural gas gathering, compression, treating and processing, for Marathon’s natural gas production in the Piceance Basin of northwest Colorado. Under the terms of the contract, we are constructing fifty miles of gathering lines to connect Marathon’s multi-well drilling sites, production from which is expected to peak at approximately 180 MMcf/d, to our Piceance Creek Gathering System. From there, the natural gas will be delivered to our Meeker natural gas processing facility. 74 Table of Contents Expansion of Wilson natural gas storage facility. We are developing a new natural gas storage cavern located on the Boling Salt Dome near Boling, Texas. The cavern is designed to store approximately 7.9 Bcf of natural gas, of which approximately 5.0 Bcf will be working gas capacity and 2.9 Bcf will be the base gas requirements needed to support minimum pressures. This expansion project was approved by the Texas Railroad Commission and is projected to commence operations in 2010. We expect to secure binding precedent agreements on all capacity before the cavern commences operations. Pipeline Integrity Costs Our NGL, petrochemical and natural gas pipelines are subject to pipeline safety programs administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation, through its Office of Pipeline Safety. This federal agency has issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines (which include NGL and petrochemical pipelines) and natural gas pipelines. In general, these regulations require companies to assess the condition of their pipelines in certain high consequence areas (as defined by the regulation) and to perform any necessary repairs. In April 2002, a subsidiary of ours acquired several midstream energy assets located in Texas and New Mexico from El Paso Corporation (“El Paso”). These assets included the Texas Intrastate System and the Waha and Carlsbad Gathering Systems. With respect to such assets, El Paso agreed to indemnify our subsidiary for any pipeline integrity costs it incurred (whether paid or payable) for five years following the acquisition date. The indemnity provisions did not take effect until such costs exceeded $3.3 million annually; however, the amount reimbursable by El Paso was capped at $50.2 million in the aggregate. In 2007 and 2006, we recovered $31.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively from El Paso related to our 2006 and 2005 expenditures. During 2007, we received a final amount of $5.4 million from El Paso related to this indemnity. The following table summarizes our pipeline integrity costs, net of indemnity payments from El Paso, for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Expensed $ 43,499 $ 26,397 $ 17,245 Capitalized 52,420 38,180 24,964 Total $ 95,919 $ 64,577 $ 42,209 We expect our cash outlay for the pipeline integrity program, irrespective of whether such costs are capitalized or expensed to approximate $65 million in 2008. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting process, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following describes the estimation risk currently underlying our most significant financial statement items: Depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the assets. Our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. 75 Table of Contents Examples of such circumstances include: § changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset; § changes in technology that render an asset obsolete; § changes in expected salvage values; or § changes in the forecast life of applicable resource basins, if any. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was $11.59 billion and $9.83 billion, respectively. We recorded $414.9 million, $350.8 million, and $328.7 million in depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Notes 2 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring recoverability of long-lived assets and equity method investments In general, long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, oil or NGLs. Long-lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through expected future cash flows are written-down to their estimated fair values. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the existing asset. Our estimates of such undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated salvage values. An impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is based on a series of assumptions similar to those used to derive undiscounted cash flows. Those assumptions also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes, market values and replacement cost estimates. An equity method investment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible loss in value of the investment other than a temporary decline. Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee’s industry. The carrying value of an equity method investment is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of discounted estimated cash flows expected to be derived from the investment. This estimate of discounted cash flows is based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment. A significant change in these underlying assumptions could result in our recording an impairment charge. We recognized a non-cash asset impairment charge related to property, plant and equipment of $0.1 million in 2006, which is reflected as a component of operating costs and expenses. No such asset impairment charges were recorded in 2007 and 2005. During 2007, we evaluated our equity method investment in Nemo Gathering Company, LLC for impairment. As a result of this evaluation, we recorded a $7.0 million non-cash impairment charge that is a component of equity income from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2007. Similarly, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we evaluated our equity method investment in Neptune Pipeline Company, L.L.C. for impairment and recorded a $7.4 million non-cash impairment charge. We had no such impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2005. 76 Table of Contents For additional information regarding impairment charges associated with our long-lived assets and equity method investments, see Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Amortization methods and estimated useful lives of qualifying intangible assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential intangible assets include intellectual property, such as technology, patents, trademarks and trade names, customer contracts and relationships, and non-compete agreements, as well as other intangible assets. The method used to value each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset, the business in which it is utilized, and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. Our customer relationship intangible assets primarily represent the customer base we acquired in connection with business combinations and asset purchases. The value we assigned to these customer relationships is being amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits of the underlying oil and natural gas resource bases from which the customers produce are estimated to be consumed or otherwise used. Our estimate of the useful life of each resource base is based on a number of factors, including reserve estimates, the economic viability of production and exploration activities and other industry factors. Our contract-based intangible assets represent the rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated useful life (or term), which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of an entity. Our estimates of useful life are based on a number of factors, including: § the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., fractionation facility, pipeline, etc.); § any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights; and § any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such agreements. If our underlying assumptions regarding the estimated useful life of an intangible asset change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, if we determine that an intangible asset’s unamortized cost may not be recoverable due to impairment; we may be required to reduce the carrying value and the subsequent useful life of the asset. Any such write-down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was $917.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. We recorded $89.7 million, $88.8 million, and $88.9 million in amortization expense associated with our intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Methods we employ to measure the fair value of goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase prices we paid for certain businesses over their respective fair values. We do not amortize goodwill; however, we test our goodwill (at the reporting unit level) for impairment during the second quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Our goodwill testing involves the determination of a reporting unit’s fair value, which is predicated on our assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the reporting unit. 77 Table of Contents Such assumptions include: § discrete financial forecasts for the assets contained within the reporting unit, which rely on management’s estimates of operating margins and transportation volumes; § long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and § appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of the reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a charge to earnings is required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying value of our goodwill was $591.7 million and $590.5 million, respectively. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our revenue recognition policies and use of estimates for revenues and expenses In general, we recognize revenue from our customers when all of the following criteria are met: § persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; § delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; § the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable; and § collectability is reasonably assured. We record revenue when sales contracts are settled (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed). We record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts as required by our established policy. Our use of certain estimates for revenues and expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the timing of compiling actual billing information and receiving third-party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of such use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for the subject period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month, adjusted accordingly for any known or expected changes in volumes or rates through the end of the month. If the basis of our estimates proves to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying notes. Reserves for environmental matters Each of our business segments is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations may, in certain instances, require us to remediate current or former operating sites where specified substances have been released or disposed 78 Table of Contents of. We accrue reserves for environmental matters when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments are based on studies, as well as site surveys, to determine the extent of any environmental damage and the necessary requirements to remediate this damage. Future environmental developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws and additional claims for damages to property, employees and other persons resulting from current or past operations, could result in substantial additional costs beyond our current reserves. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had a liability for environmental remediation of $26.5 million and $24.2 million, respectively, which was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon studies and site surveys. We follow the provisions of AICPA Statement of Position 96-1, which provides key guidance on recognition, measurement and disclosure of remediation liabilities. We have recorded our best estimate of the cost of remediation activities. See Item 3 of this annual report for recent developments regarding environmental matters. Natural gas imbalances In the pipeline transportation business, natural gas imbalances frequently result from differences in gas volumes received from and delivered to our customers. Such differences occur when a customer delivers more or less gas into our pipelines than is physically redelivered back to them during a particular time period. The vast majority of our settlements are through in-kind arrangements whereby incremental volumes are delivered to a customer (in the case of an imbalance payable) or received from a customer (in the case of an imbalance receivable). Such in-kind deliveries are on-going and take place over several months. In some cases, settlements of imbalances accumulated over a period of time are ultimately cashed out and are generally negotiated at values which approximate average market prices over a period of time. As a result, for gas imbalances that are ultimately settled over future periods, we estimate the value of such current assets and liabilities using average market prices, which is representative of the estimated value of the imbalances upon final settlement. Changes in natural gas prices may impact our estimates. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our imbalance receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, were $60.9 million and $97.8 million, respectively, and are reflected as a component of “Accounts and notes receivable — trade” on our balance sheets. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our imbalance payables were $38.3 million and $51.2 million, respectively, and are reflected as a component of “Accrued gas payables” on our balance sheets. Other Items Initial Public Offering of Duncan Energy Partners In September 2006, we formed a consolidated subsidiary, Duncan Energy Partners, to acquire, own and operate a diversified portfolio of midstream energy assets and to support the growth objectives of EPO. On February 5, 2007, Duncan Energy Partners completed its initial public offering of 14,950,000 common units (including an overallotment amount of 1,950,000 common units) at $21.00 per unit, which generated net proceeds to Duncan Energy Partners of $291.9 million. As consideration for assets contributed and reimbursement for capital expenditures related to these assets, Duncan Energy Partners distributed $260.6 million of these net proceeds to us along with $198.9 million in borrowings under its credit facility and a final amount of 5,351,571 common units of Duncan Energy Partners. Duncan Energy Partners used $38.5 million of net proceeds from the overallotment to redeem 1,950,000 of the 7,301,571 common units it had originally issued to Enterprise Products Partners, resulting in the final amount of 5,351,571 common units beneficially owned by Enterprise Products Partners. We used the cash received from Duncan Energy Partners to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. 79 Table of Contents We contributed 66% of our equity interests in the following subsidiaries to Duncan Energy Partners: § Mont Belvieu Caverns, which owns salt dome storage caverns located in Mont Belvieu, Texas that receive, store and deliver NGLs and certain petrochemical products for industrial customers located along the upper Texas Gulf Coast, which has the largest concentration of petrochemical plants and refineries in the United States; § Acadian Gas, which owns an onshore natural gas pipeline system that gathers, transports, stores and markets natural gas in Louisiana. The Acadian Gas system links natural gas supplies from onshore and offshore Gulf of Mexico developments (including offshore pipelines, continental shelf and deepwater production) with local gas distribution companies, electric generation plants and industrial customers, including those in the Baton Rouge-New Orleans-Mississippi River corridor. A subsidiary of Acadian Gas owns our 49.5% equity interest in Evangeline; § Sabine Propylene, which transports polymer-grade propylene between Port Arthur, Texas and a pipeline interconnect located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana; § Lou-Tex Propylene, which transports chemical-grade propylene from Sorrento, Louisiana to Mont Belvieu, Texas; and § South Texas NGL, which began transporting NGLs from Corpus Christi, Texas to Mont Belvieu, Texas in January 2007. South Texas NGL owns the DEP South Texas NGL Pipeline System. In addition to the 34% ownership interest we retained in each of these entities, we also own the 2% general partner interest in Duncan Energy Partners and 26.4% of Duncan Energy Partners’ outstanding common units. Accordingly, we have in effect retained a net economic interest of approximately 52.4% in Duncan Energy Partners as of December 31, 2007. EPO directs the business operations of Duncan Energy Partners through its ownership and control of the general partner of Duncan Energy Partners. For financial reporting purposes, we consolidate the financial statements of Duncan Energy Partners with those of our own and reflect its operations as a component of our business segments. Also, due to common control of the entities by Dan L. Duncan, the initial consolidated balance sheet of Duncan Energy Partners reflects our historical carrying basis in each of the subsidiaries contributed to Duncan Energy Partners. The public ownership of Duncan Energy Partners’ net assets and earnings are presented as a component of minority interest in our consolidated financial statements. The public owners of Duncan Energy Partners have no direct equity interests in us as a result of this transaction. The borrowings of Duncan Energy Partners are presented as part of our consolidated debt; however, we do not have any obligation for the payment of interest or repayment of borrowings incurred by Duncan Energy Partners. For additional information regarding Duncan Energy Partners, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. In certain cases, EPO is responsible for funding 100% of project costs rather than sharing such costs with Duncan Energy Partners in accordance with the existing sharing ratio of 66% funded by Duncan Energy Partners and 34% funded by EPO. Under the Omnibus Agreement, EPO agreed to make additional contributions to Duncan Energy Partners as reimbursement for Duncan Energy Partners’ 66% share of any excess project costs above (i) the $28.6 million of estimated project costs to complete the Phase II expansions of the DEP South Texas NGL Pipeline System and (ii) $14.1 million of estimated project costs for additional Mont Belvieu brine production capacity and above-ground storage reservoir projects. These projects were in progress at the time of Duncan Energy Partners’ initial public offering. In December 2007, EPO made cash contributions totaling $9.9 million to Duncan Energy Partners’ subsidiaries in connection with the Omnibus Agreement. In December 2007, EPO made an additional $38.1 million cash contribution to Mont Belvieu Caverns for capital expenditures in which Duncan Energy Partners is not a participant. This contribution was in accordance with provisions of the Mont Belvieu Caverns’ limited liability company agreement, which states that when Duncan Energy Partners elects to not participate in certain projects, then EPO is responsible for funding 100% of such projects. To the extent such non-participated projects generate incremental earnings for Mont Belvieu Caverns in the future, the sharing ratio for Mont Belvieu Caverns will be adjusted to allocate such incremental cash flows to EPO. Under the terms of the agreement, Duncan Energy Partners may elect to reacquire for consideration a 66% share of these projects at a later date. Insurance Matters We participate as named insureds in EPCO’s current insurance program, which provides us with property damage, business interruption and other coverages, which are customary for the nature and scope of our operations. EPCO attempts to place all insurance coverage with carriers having ratings of “A” or higher. However, two carriers associated with the EPCO insurance program were downgraded by Standard & Poor’s during 2006. One of these carriers is currently rated at “A-” and the other, “BBB.” At present, there is no indication that these two carriers would be unable to fulfill any insuring obligation. Furthermore, we currently do not have any claims which might be affected by these carriers. EPCO continues to monitor these situations. For additional information regarding our significant risks and uncertainties due to hurricanes, see Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 80 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands).

(6) As presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2007, other long-term liabilities consist primarily of (i) liabilities for our asset retirement obligations and (ii) liabilities for environmental remediation costs. For information regarding our environmental remediation costs and asset retirement obligations, see Notes 2 and 10 respectively, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations involving operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Except for the following information regarding debt obligations of certain unconsolidated affiliates, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements, as described in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The following information summarizes the significant terms of such unconsolidated debt obligations. 81 Table of Contents Poseidon. At December 31, 2007, Poseidon’s debt obligations consisted of $91.0 million outstanding under its $150.0 million revolving credit facility. Amounts borrowed under this facility mature in May 2011 and are secured by substantially all of Poseidon’s assets. Evangeline. At December 31, 2007, Evangeline’s debt obligations consisted of (i) $13.2 million in principal amount of 9.90% fixed rate Series B senior secured notes due December 2010 and (ii) a $7.5 million subordinated note payable. Enterprise Products Partners had $1.1 million of letters of credit outstanding on December 31, 2007 that were furnished on behalf of Evangeline’s debt. Summary of Related Party Transactions The following table summarizes our related party transactions for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands). For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues from consolidated operations EPCO and affiliates $ 362,076 $ 98,671 $ 311 Unconsolidated affiliates 290,640 304,559 367,204 Total $ 652,716 $ 403,230 $ 367,515 Operating costs and expenses EPCO and affiliates $ 329,699 $ 311,537 $ 293,134 Unconsolidated affiliates 32,765 31,606 23,563 Total $ 362,464 $ 343,143 $ 316,697 General and administrative expenses EPCO and affiliates $ 56,518 $ 41,265 $ 40,954 For additional information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. For information regarding certain business relationships and related transactions, see Item 13 of this annual report. We have an extensive and ongoing relationship with EPCO and its affiliates, including TEPPCO and Energy Transfer Equity. Our revenues from EPCO and affiliates are primarily associated with sales of NGL products. Our expenses with EPCO and affiliates are primarily due to (i) reimbursements we pay EPCO in connection with an administrative services agreement and (ii) purchases of NGL products. TEPPCO is an affiliate of ours due to the common control relationship of both entities. Enterprise GP Holdings acquired non-controlling ownership interests in both ETE GP and Energy Transfer Equity in May 2007. As a result of this transaction, ETE GP and Energy Transfer Equity became related parties to us. Many of our unconsolidated affiliates perform supporting or complementary roles to our consolidated business operations. The majority of our revenues from unconsolidated affiliates relate to natural gas sales to a Louisiana affiliate. The majority of our expenses with unconsolidated affiliates pertain to payments we make to K/D/S Promix, L.L.C. for NGL transportation, storage and fractionation services. On February 5, 2007, our consolidated subsidiary, Duncan Energy Partners, completed an underwritten initial public offering of its common units. Duncan Energy Partners was formed in September 2006 as a Delaware limited partnership to, among other things, acquire ownership interests in certain of our midstream energy businesses. For additional information regarding Duncan Energy Partners, see “Other Items — Initial Public Offering of Duncan Energy Partners” within this section. 82 Table of Contents Non-GAAP reconciliations A reconciliation of our measurement of total non-GAAP gross operating margin to GAAP operating income and income before provision for income taxes, minority interest and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles follows (dollars in thousands): For the Year the Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Total segment gross operating margin $ 1,492,068 $ 1,362,449 $ 1,136,347 Adjustments to reconcile total gross operating margin To operating income: Depreciation, amortization and accretion in operating costs and expenses (513,840 ) (440,256 ) (413,441 ) Operating lease expense paid by EPCO (2,105 ) (2,109 ) (2,112 ) Gain (loss) on sale of assets in operating costs and expenses (5,391 ) 3,359 4,488 General and administrative costs (87,695 ) (63,391 ) (62,266 ) Consolidated operating income 883,037 860,052 663,016 Other expense, net (303,463 ) (229,967 ) (225,178 ) Income before provision for income taxes, minority interest and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 579,574 $ 630,085 $ 437,838 EPCO subleases to us certain equipment located at our Mont Belvieu facility and 100 railcars for $1 per year (the “retained leases”). These subleases are part of the administrative services agreement that we executed with EPCO in connection with our formation in 1998. EPCO holds this equipment pursuant to operating leases for which it has retained the corresponding cash lease payment obligation. We record the full value of such lease payments made by EPCO as a non-cash related party operating expense, with the offset to partners’ equity recorded as a general contribution to our partnership. Apart from the partnership interests we granted to EPCO at our formation, EPCO does not receive any additional ownership rights as a result of its contribution to us of the retained leases. For additional information regarding the administrative services agreement and the retained leases, see Item 13 of this annual report. Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles Our Statements of Consolidated Operations reflect the following cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles: § We recognized, as a benefit, a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $1.5 million in 2006 based on the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” requirements to recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of an equity award and the application of an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested awards. § We recorded a $4.2 million non-cash expense related to certain asset retirement obligations in 2005 due to our implementation of FIN 47 as of December 31, 2005. For additional information regarding these changes in accounting principles, including a presentation of the pro forma effects these changes would have had on our historical earnings, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 83 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Several new accounting standards have recently been issued that will or may affect our future financial statements: § Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 157, “Fair Value Measurements;” § SFAS 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51;” and § SFAS 141(R), “Business Combinations.” For additional information regarding these recent accounting developments and others that may affect our future financial statements, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. In addition, we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar. We may use financial instruments (i.e., futures, forwards, swaps, options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics) to mitigate the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions. In general, the type of risks we attempt to hedge are those related to (i) the variability of future earnings, (ii) fair values of certain debt instruments and (iii) cash flows resulting from changes in applicable interest rates, commodity prices or exchange rates. We recognize financial instruments as assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on fair value. Fair value is generally defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, not in a forced or liquidation sale. The estimated fair values of our financial instruments have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques. We must use considerable judgment, however, in interpreting market data and developing these estimates. Accordingly, our fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize upon disposition of these instruments. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation techniques could have a material effect on our estimates of fair value. Changes in the fair value of financial instrument contracts are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the financial instruments meet those criteria, the instrument’s gains and losses offset the related results of the hedged item in earnings for a fair value hedge and are deferred in other comprehensive income for a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses related to a cash flow hedge are reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For additional information regarding our accounting for financial instruments, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. To qualify as a hedge, the item to be hedged must be exposed to commodity, interest rate or exchange rate risk and the hedging instrument must reduce the exposure and meet the hedging requirements of SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (as amended and interpreted). We must formally designate the financial instrument as a hedge and document and assess the effectiveness of the hedge at inception and on a quarterly basis. Any ineffectiveness of the hedge is recorded in current earnings. We routinely review our outstanding financial instruments in light of current market conditions. If market conditions warrant, some financial instruments may be closed out in advance of their contractual settlement dates thus realizing income or loss depending on the specific hedging criteria. When this occurs, we may enter into a new financial instrument to reestablish the hedge to which the closed instrument relates. 84 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Hedging Program Our interest rate exposure results from variable and fixed rate borrowings under various debt agreements. We manage a portion of our interest rate exposures by utilizing interest rate swaps and similar arrangements, which allow us to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt or a portion of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt. The following information summarizes significant components of our interest rate risk hedging portfolio: Fair value hedges — Interest rate swaps As summarized in the following table, we had eleven interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2007 that were accounted for as fair value hedges. Number Period Covered Termination Fixed to Notional Hedged Fixed Rate Debt Of Swaps by Swap Date of Swap Variable Rate (1) Amount Senior Notes B, 7.50% fixed rate, due Feb. 2011 1 Jan. 2004 to Feb. 2011 Feb. 2011 7.50% to 8.65% $50 million Senior Notes C, 6.375% fixed rate, due Feb. 2013 2 Jan. 2004 to Feb. 2013 Feb. 2013 6.38% to 7.19% $200 million Senior Notes G, 5.6% fixed rate, due Oct. 2014 6 4th Qtr. 2004 to Oct. 2014 Oct. 2014 5.60% to 6.13% $600 million Senior Notes K, 4.95% fixed rate, due June 2010 2 Aug. 2005 to June 2010 June 2010 4.95% to 5.33% $200 million (1) The variable rate indicated is the all-in variable rate for the current settlement period. We have designated these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges under SFAS 133 since they mitigate changes in the fair value of the underlying fixed rate debt. As effective fair value hedges, an increase in the fair value of these interest rate swaps is equally offset by an increase in the fair value of the underlying hedged debt. The offsetting changes in fair value have no effect on current period interest expense. These eleven agreements have a combined notional amount of $1.1 billion and match the maturity dates of the underlying debt being hedged. Under each swap agreement, we pay the counterparty a variable interest rate based on six-month London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) (plus an applicable margin as defined in each swap agreement), and receive back from the counterparty a fixed interest rate payment based on the stated interest rate of the debt being hedged, with both payments calculated using the notional amounts stated in each swap agreement. We settle amounts receivable from or payable to the counterparties every six months (the “settlement period”). The settlement amount is amortized ratably to earnings as either an increase or a decrease in interest expense over the settlement period. The total fair value of these eleven interest rate swaps at December 31, 2007, was an asset of $14.8 million, with an offsetting decrease in the fair value of the underlying debt. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 reflects a $8.9 million loss, $5.2 million loss and $10.8 million benefit from these swap agreements, respectively. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap portfolio and the related change in fair value (“FV”) of the underlying debt at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). Income is not affected by changes in the fair value of these swaps; however, these swaps effectively convert the hedged portion of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. As a result, interest expense (and related cash outlays for debt service) will increase or decrease with the change in the periodic “reset” rate associated with the respective swap. Typically, the reset rate is an agreed upon index rate published for the first day of the six-month interest calculation period. Swap Fair Value at Resulting December 31, December 31, February 12, Scenario Classification 2006 2007 2008 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) $ (29,060 ) $ 14,839 $ 42,544 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) (56,249 ) (5,425 ) 24,479 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) (1,872 ) 35,102 60,610 85 Table of Contents The fair value of the interest rate swaps excludes related hedged amounts we have recorded in earnings. The change in fair value between December 31, 2007 and February 12, 2008 is primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates relative to the interest rates used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments at December 31, 2007. The underlying floating LIBOR forward interest rate curve used to determine the February 12, 2008 fair values ranged from approximately 2.25% to 5.53% using 6-month reset periods ranging from February 2008 to March 2014. Cash flow hedges — Interest Rate Swaps Duncan Energy Partners had three interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2007 that were accounted for as cash flow hedges. Number Period Covered Termination Variable to Notional Hedged Variable Rate Debt Of Swaps by Swap Date of Swap Fixed Rate(1) Value Duncan Energy Partners’ Revolver, due Feb. 2011 3 Sep. 2007 to Sep. 2010 Sep. 2010 4.84% to 4.62% $175.0 million (1) Amounts receivable from or payable to the swap counterparties are settled every three months (the “settlement period”). In September 2007, Duncan Energy Partners executed three floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps having a combined notional value of $175.0 million. The purpose of these financial instruments is to reduce the sensitivity of Duncan Energy Partners’ earnings to variable interest rates charged under its revolving credit facility. It recognized a $0.2 million benefit from these swaps in interest expense during 2007, which includes ineffectiveness of $0.2 million (an expense) and income of $0.4 million. In 2008, Duncan Energy Partners expects to reclassify $0.7 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss that was generated by these interest rate swaps as an increase to interest expense. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps was a liability of $3.8 million. As cash flow hedges, any increase or decrease in fair value (to the extent effective) would be recorded into other comprehensive income and amortized into income based on the settlement period hedged. Any ineffectiveness is recorded directly into earnings as an increase in interest expense. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of Duncan Energy Partners’ interest rate swap portfolio (dollars in thousands). Swap Fair Value at Resulting December 31, February 12, Scenario Classification 2007 2008 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Liability $ 3,782 $ 7,749 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Liability 2,245 6,563 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Liability 5,319 8,934 Cash flow hedges — Treasury locks At times, we may use treasury lock financial instruments to hedge the underlying U.S. treasury rates related to our anticipated issuances of debt. A treasury lock is a specialized agreement that fixes the price (or yield) on a specific treasury security for an established period of time. A treasury lock purchaser is protected from a rise in the yield of the underlying treasury security during the lock period. Each of the treasury lock transactions was designated as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. To the extent effective, gains and losses on the value of the treasury locks will be deferred until the forecasted debt is issued and will be amortized to earnings over the life of the debt. No ineffectiveness was recognized as of December 31, 2007. Gains or losses on the termination of such instruments are amortized to earnings using the effective interest method over the estimated term of the underlying fixed-rate debt. 86 Table of Contents The following table summarizes changes in our treasury lock portfolio since December 31, 2005 (dollars in millions): Notional Cash Amount Gain Second quarter of 2006 additions to portfolio (1) $ 250.0 $ — Third quarter of 2006 additions to portfolio (1) 50.0 — Third quarter of 2006 terminations (2) (300.0 ) — Fourth quarter of 2006 additions to portfolio (3) 562.5 — Treasury lock portfolio, December 31, 2006 (4) 562.5 — First quarter of 2007 additions to portfolio (3) 437.5 — Second quarter of 2007 terminations (5) (875.0 ) 42.3 Third quarter of 2007 additions to portfolio (6) 875.0 — Third quarter of 2007 terminations (7) (750.0 ) 6.6 Fourth quarter of 2007 additions to portfolio (8) 350.0 — Treasury lock portfolio, December 31, 2007 (4) $ 600.0 $ 48.9 (1) EPO entered into these transactions related to its anticipated issuances of debt in 2006. (2) Terminations relate to the issuance of the Junior Notes A ($300.0 million). (3) EPO entered into these transactions related to its anticipated issuances of debt in 2007. (4) The fair value of open financial instruments at December 31, 2006 and 2007 was an asset of $11.2 million and a liability of $19.6 million, respectively. (5) Terminations relate to the issuance of the Junior Notes B ($500.0 million) and Senior Notes L ($375.0 million). Of the $42.3 million gain, $10.6 million relates to the Junior Notes B and the remainder to the Senior Notes L and its successor debt. (6) EPO entered into these transactions related to its issuance of the Senior Notes L (including its successor debt) in August 2007 ($500.0 million) and anticipated issuance of debt during the first half of 2008 ($250.0 million) (7) Terminations relate to the issuance of the Senior Notes L and its successor debt. (8) EPO entered into these transactions in anticipated issuance of debt during the first half of 2008. Commodity Risk Hedging Program The prices of natural gas, NGLs and certain petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage the price risks associated with such products, we may enter into commodity financial instruments. The primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to price risks associated with (i) natural gas purchases, (ii) the value of NGL production and inventories, (iii) related firm commitments, (iv) fluctuations in transportation revenues where the underlying fees are based on natural gas index prices and (v) certain anticipated transactions involving either natural gas, NGLs or certain petrochemical products. From time to time, we inject natural gas into storage and utilize hedging instruments to lock in the value of our inventory positions. The commodity financial instruments we utilize may be settled in cash or with another financial instrument. The fair value of our commodity financial instrument portfolio, which primarily consisted of cash flow hedges, at December 31, 2007 was a liability of $19.3 million. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a $28.6 million loss, $10.3 million income and $1.1 million income, respectively, related to our commodity financial instruments, which is included in operating costs and expenses on our Statements of Consolidated Operations. Included in the $28.6 million loss recorded during 2007, was ineffectiveness of $0.9 million (an expense) related to our commodity hedges. These contracts will terminate during 2008, and any amounts remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recorded in earnings. We assess the risk of our commodity financial instrument portfolio using a sensitivity analysis model. The sensitivity analysis applied to this portfolio measures the potential income or loss (i.e., the change in fair value of the portfolio) based upon a hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying quoted market prices of the commodity financial instruments outstanding at the date indicated within the following table. 87 Table of Contents The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of this portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in thousands): Resulting Commodity Financial Instrument Portfolio FV Scenario Classification December 31, 2006 December 31, 2007 February 12, 2008 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ (3,184 ) $ (19,305 ) $ 25,941 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (2,119 ) 9,903 52,974 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Liability (4,249 ) (48,513 ) (1,114 ) The increase in portfolio fair value between December 31, 2007 and February 12, 2008 is primarily due to an increase in the price of natural gas. Foreign Currency Hedging Program We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk through our Canadian NGL marketing subsidiary and certain construction agreements with respect to our Pioneer processing plant where payments are indexed to the Canadian dollar. As a result, we could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. We attempt to hedge this risk using foreign exchange purchase contracts to fix the exchange rate. Mark-to-market accounting is utilized for those foreign exchange contracts associated with our Canadian NGL marketing business. The duration of these contracts is typically one month. As of December 31, 2007, $4.7 million of these exchange contracts were outstanding, all of which settled in January 2008. In January 2008, we entered into $3.7 million of such instruments. The foreign exchange contracts associated with our construction activities are accounted for using hedge accounting. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of these contracts was $1.3 million. These contracts settle through May 2008. Product Purchase Commitments We have long and short-term purchase commitments for NGLs, petrochemicals and natural gas with several suppliers. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. For additional information regarding these commitments, see “Contractual Obligations” included under Item 7 of this annual report. 88",2023-12-30 21:16:48.456948
1061219,EPD,ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS PARTNERS L.P.,2004,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. We are a publicly traded limited partnership (NYSE symbol, “EPD”) that was formed in April 1998 to acquire, own, and operate all of the NGL processing and distribution assets of Enterprise Products Company, or EPCO. We conduct all of our business through our wholly owned subsidiary, Enterprise Products Operating L.P., our “Operating Partnership” and its subsidiaries and joint ventures. Our general partner, Enterprise Products GP, LLC, owns a 2.0% interest in us. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” are intended to mean the consolidated business and operations of Enterprise Products Partners L.P., which includes Enterprise Products Operating L.P. and its subsidiaries. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included under Item 8 of this annual report. In addition, the reader should review “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors” under Item 1 of this annual report for information regarding forward-looking statements made in this discussion and certain risks inherent in our business. Other risks involved in our business are discussed under “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” included under Item 7A of this annual report. Additionally, please see Part III, Item 13 for a discussion of related-party matters, including our relationship with Shell. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS On December 15, 2003, we and certain of our affiliates, El Paso Corporation and certain of its affiliates (“El Paso”), and GulfTerra Energy Partners, L.P. (“GulfTerra”) and certain of its affiliates entered into a series of agreements under which one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and GulfTerra would merge, with GulfTerra surviving the merger and becoming wholly-owned by us. Formed in 1993, GulfTerra is a publicly traded limited partnership (NYSE symbol, “GTM”) that manages a balanced, diversified portfolio of interests and assets relating to the midstream energy sector. Prior to December 15, 2003, El Paso was majority owner of GulfTerra’s general partner and owns a 31.8% limited partner interest in GulfTerra. In general, GulfTerra’s business lines include: • Ownership or interests in over 15,700 miles of natural gas pipeline systems. These pipeline systems include gathering systems onshore in Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas and offshore in some of the most active drilling and development regions in the Gulf of Mexico. GulfTerra 49 also owns interests in five natural gas processing and treating plants located in New Mexico, Texas and Colorado; • Ownership in over 1,000 miles of intrastate NGL gathering and transportation pipelines and four NGL fractionation plants located in Texas. GulfTerra also owns interests in three offshore oil pipeline systems, which extend over 340 miles, owns a 3.3 MMBbl propane storage and leaching business located in Mississippi and owns or leases NGL storage facilities in Louisiana and Texas with aggregate capacity of approximately 21.3 MMBbls; • Ownership in two salt dome natural gas storage facilities located in Mississippi that have a combined current working capacity of 13.5 Bcf. In addition, GulfTerra has the exclusive right to use a natural gas storage facility located in Wharton, Texas under an operating lease that expires in January 2008. This facility has a working gas capacity of 6.4 Bcf; • Interests in seven multi-purpose offshore hub platforms in the Gulf of Mexico that were specifically designed to be used as deepwater hubs and production handling and pipeline maintenance facilities; and • Interests in four oil and natural gas producing properties located in waters offshore Louisiana. Production is gathered, transported, and processed through GulfTerra’s pipeline systems and platform facilities, and sold to various third parties and El Paso. GulfTerra is one of the largest natural gas gatherers, based on miles of pipeline, in the prolific natural gas supply regions offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in Texas and in the San Juan Basin, which includes a significant portion of the four contiguous corners of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. These regions, especially the deepwater regions of the Gulf of Mexico, which is one of the United States’ fastest growing oil and natural gas producing regions, offer GulfTerra significant growth potential through the acquisition and construction of pipelines, platforms, processing and storage facilities and other energy infrastructure. The proposed merger is a three-step process outlined as follows: • Step One. On December 15, 2003, we purchased a 50% membership interest in GulfTerra’s general partner (GulfTerra Energy Company, L.L.C. or “GulfTerra GP”) for $425 million. This investment is accounted for using the equity method. This transaction is referred to as “Step One” of the proposed merger and will remain in effect even if the remainder of the proposed merger and post-merger transactions, which we refer to as Step Two and Three, do not occur. • Step Two. If all necessary regulatory and unitholder approvals are received and the other merger agreement conditions are either fulfilled or waived and the following steps are consummated, we will own 100% of the limited and general partner interests in GulfTerra. At that time, the proposed merger will be accounted for using the purchase method and GulfTerra will be a consolidated subsidiary of our company. Step Two of the proposed merger includes the following transactions: – El Paso’s contribution to our General Partner of El Paso’s remaining 50% interest in GulfTerra GP for a 50% interest in our General Partner, and the subsequent capital contribution by our General Partner of such 50% interest in GulfTerra GP to us (without increasing our General Partner’s interest in our earnings or cash distributions). – Our purchase of 10,937,500 GulfTerra Series C units and 2,876,620 GulfTerra common units owned by El Paso for $500 million; and – The exchange of each remaining GulfTerra common unit for 1.81 Enterprise common units, resulting in the issuance of approximately 103 million Enterprise common units to GulfTerra unitholders. • Step Three. Immediately after Step Two is completed, we expect to acquire nine cryogenic natural gas processing plants, one natural gas gathering system, one natural gas treating plant, and a small natural gas liquids connecting pipeline from El Paso for $150 million. We refer to the assets that we will acquire from El Paso as the South Texas midstream assets. Our preliminary estimate of the total consideration for Steps One, Two and Three we would pay or grant is approximately $3.9 billion. For a period of three years following the closing of the proposed merger, El Paso will 50 provide support services to GulfTerra similar to those provided by El Paso prior to the closing of the merger. GulfTerra will reimburse El Paso for 110% of its direct costs of such services (excluding any overhead costs). El Paso will make transition support payments to us in annual amounts of $18 million, $15 million and $12 million for the first, second and third years of such period, respectively, payable in 12 equal monthly installments for each such year. These transition support payments are included in our preliminary estimate of total consideration. We are working to complete the merger as soon as possible. A number of conditions must be satisfied before we can complete the merger, including approval by the unitholders of both the Company and GulfTerra and the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1974. While we cannot predict if and when all of the conditions to the merger will be satisfied, we expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2004. To review a copy of the merger agreement and related transaction documents, please read our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 15, 2003. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We have five reportable business (or operating) segments: Pipelines, Fractionation, Processing, Octane Enhancement and Other. Pipelines consists of NGL, petrochemical and natural gas pipeline systems, storage and import/export terminal services. Fractionation primarily includes NGL fractionation, isomerization and propylene fractionation. Processing includes our natural gas processing business and related NGL marketing activities. Octane Enhancement represents our investment in a facility that produces motor gasoline additives to enhance octane (currently producing MTBE). The Other business segment consists of fee-based marketing services and various operational support activities. We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. Our non-GAAP financial measure of total segment gross operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP operating income. We define total segment gross operating margin as operating income before: (1) depreciation and amortization expense; (2) operating lease expenses for which we do not have the payment obligation; (3) gains and losses on the sale of assets; and (4) selling, general and administrative expenses. Gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, provision for income taxes, minority interest and extraordinary charges. Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses (net of the adjustments noted above) from segment revenues, with both segment totals before the elimination of intercompany transactions. In accordance with GAAP, intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. We include equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin. Our equity investments with industry partners are a vital component of our business strategy. They are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with those of our customers, which may be a supplier of raw materials or a consumer of finished products. This method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand-alone basis. Many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations. For additional information regarding our business segments, please read Note 20 of our Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 51 The following table summarizes our consolidated revenues, costs and expenses, equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates and operating income for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): For Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 5,346,431 $ 3,584,783 $ 3,154,369 Operating costs and expenses 5,046,777 3,382,839 2,862,582 Selling, general and administrative costs 37,590 42,890 30,296 Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates (13,960) 35,253 25,358 Operating income 248,104 194,307 286,849 The following table reconciles consolidated operating income to our measurement of total segment gross operating margin for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): For Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Operating income $ 248,104 $ 194,307 $ 286,849 Adjustments to reconcile operating income to total gross operating margin: Depreciation and amortization in operating costs and expenses 115,643 86,028 48,775 Retained lease expense, net in operating costs and expenses 9,094 9,125 10,414 Loss (gain) on sale of assets in operating costs and expenses (16) (1) (390) Selling, general and administrative costs 37,590 42,890 30,296 Total segment gross operating margin $ 410,415 $ 332,349 $ 375,944 EPCO subleases to us certain equipment located at our Mont Belvieu facility and 100 railroad tankcars for $1 dollar per year. These subleases (the “retained lease expense” in the previous table) are part of the EPCO Agreement (now referred to as the “Administrative Services Agreement”) that we executed with EPCO in connection with our formation in 1998. EPCO holds these items pursuant to operating leases for which it has retained the corresponding cash lease payment obligation. Operating costs and expenses (as shown in the Statements of Consolidated Operations and Comprehensive Income) treat the lease payments being made by EPCO as a non-cash related party operating expense, with the offset to Partners’ Equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets recorded as a general contribution to the Company. Apart from the partnership interests we granted to EPCO at our formation, EPCO does not receive any additional ownership rights as a result of its contribution to us of the retained leases. In addition, EPCO has assigned to us the purchase options associated with these leases. For additional information regarding the Administrative Services Agreement and the retained leases, please read Item 13 of this annual report. 52 Our gross operating margin amounts by segment were as follows for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): For Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Gross operating margin by segment: Pipelines $ 282,854 $ 214,932 $ 96,569 Fractionation 132,822 129,000 118,610 Processing 30,328 (17,633) 154,989 Octane enhancement (1, 2) (32,701) 8,569 5,671 Other (2,888) (2,519) 105 Total segment gross operating margin $ 410,415 $ 332,349 $375,944 (1) Includes non-cash asset impairment charge of $22.5 million recorded during the third quarter of 2003. (2) Comparability of the gross operating margin for the Octane Enhancement segment for the periods presented is impacted due to ownership changes in the octane enhancement facility in 2003. Prior to October 1, 2003, our 33.3% ownership interest in this facility was recorded under the equity method of accounting. On September 30, 2003, we increased our ownership interest in this facility to 66.7%. As a result of this increased ownership interest, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2003, the financial results of this facility are now consolidated in our financial statements. Our significant pipeline throughput, plant production and processing volumetric data were as follows for the periods indicated (on a net basis, taking into account our ownership interests): For Year Ended December 31, 2003 (1) 2002 (1) 2001 (1) MBPD, Net NGL and petrochemical pipelines (2) 1,343 1,352 453 NGL fractionation 227 235 204 Isomerization 77 84 80 Propylene fractionation 57 55 31 Equity NGL production 56 73 63 Octane enhancement 4 5 5 BBtus per day, Net Natural gas pipelines 1,032 1,201 1,349 Equivalent MBPD, Net NGL, petrochemical and natural gas pipelines (3) 1,615 1,668 808 (1) Volumetric data shown in the table above reflect operating rates of the underlying assets for the periods in which we owned them. (2) In addition to NGL and petrochemical pipeline volumes, this operating statistic also includes NGL import and export volumes. (3) Aggregate pipeline volumes are shown on an energy-equivalent basis where 3.8 MMBtus of natural gas throughput are equivalent to one barrel of NGL throughput. 53 Product and Commodity Price Information The following table illustrates selected average quarterly industry index prices for natural gas, crude oil, selected NGL and petrochemical products and indicative gas processing gross spreads since the beginning of 2001: Natural Gas, $/MMBtu Crude Oil, $/barrel Ethane, $/gallon Propane, $/gallon Normal Butane, $/gallon Isobutane, $/gallon Natural Gasoline, $/gallon Polymer Grade Propylene, $/pound Refinery Grade Propylene, $/pound Indicative Gas Processing Gross Spread, $/gallon (1) (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (3) 2001 1st Quarter $ 7.05 $ 28.77 $ 0.49 $ 0.63 $ 0.70 $ 0.74 $ 0.74 $ 0.23 $ 0.17 $ (0.01) 2nd Quarter $ 4.65 $ 27.86 $ 0.37 $ 0.50 $ 0.56 $ 0.66 $ 0.63 $ 0.19 $ 0.12 $ 0.08 3rd Quarter $ 2.90 $ 26.64 $ 0.27 $ 0.41 $ 0.49 $ 0.49 $ 0.56 $ 0.16 $ 0.13 $ 0.14 4th Quarter $ 2.43 $ 21.04 $ 0.21 $ 0.34 $ 0.40 $ 0.39 $ 0.44 $ 0.18 $ 0.13 $ 0.11 Average $ 4.26 $ 26.07 $ 0.33 $ 0.47 $ 0.54 $ 0.57 $ 0.59 $ 0.19 $ 0.14 $ 0.08 2002 1st Quarter $ 2.34 $ 21.41 $ 0.22 $ 0.30 $ 0.38 $ 0.44 $ 0.47 $ 0.16 $ 0.12 $ 0.12 2nd Quarter $ 3.38 $ 26.26 $ 0.26 $ 0.40 $ 0.48 $ 0.51 $ 0.58 $ 0.20 $ 0.17 $ 0.10 3rd Quarter $ 3.16 $ 28.30 $ 0.26 $ 0.42 $ 0.52 $ 0.58 $ 0.61 $ 0.21 $ 0.16 $ 0.14 4th Quarter $ 3.99 $ 28.33 $ 0.31 $ 0.49 $ 0.60 $ 0.63 $ 0.66 $ 0.20 $ 0.15 $ 0.13 Average $ 3.22 $ 26.08 $ 0.26 $ 0.40 $ 0.50 $ 0.54 $ 0.58 $ 0.20 $ 0.15 $ 0.12 2003 1st Quarter $ 6.58 $ 34.12 $ 0.43 $ 0.65 $ 0.76 $ 0.80 $ 0.85 $ 0.24 $ 0.21 $ 0.05 2nd Quarter $ 5.40 $ 29.04 $ 0.39 $ 0.53 $ 0.58 $ 0.62 $ 0.65 $ 0.25 $ 0.19 $ 0.04 3rd Quarter $ 4.97 $ 30.21 $ 0.37 $ 0.56 $ 0.67 $ 0.68 $ 0.73 $ 0.21 $ 0.15 $ 0.10 4th Quarter $ 4.58 $ 31.18 $ 0.40 $ 0.58 $ 0.73 $ 0.71 $ 0.75 $ 0.22 $ 0.16 $ 0.17 Average $ 5.38 $ 31.14 $ 0.40 $ 0.58 $ 0.68 $ 0.70 $ 0.74 $ 0.23 $ 0.18 $ 0.09 (1) Natural gas, NGL, polymer grade propylene and refinery grade propylene prices represent an average of various commercial index prices including OPIS and CMAI.

(3) The Indicative Gas Processing Gross Spread is a relativemeasure used by the NGL industry as an indicator of the gross economic benefit derived from extracting NGLs from natural gas production on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Specifically, it is the amount that the economic value of a composite gallon of NGLs exceeds the value of the equivalent amount of energy of natural gas based on NGL and natural gas prices on the U.S. Gulf Coast. It is assumed that a gallon of NGLs is comprised of 33% ethane, 32% propane, 11% normal butane, 8% isobutane and 16% natural gasoline. The value of a composite gallon of NGLs is determined by multiplying these component percentages by industry index prices listed in the table above. The value of the equivalent amount of energy of natural gas to one gallon of NGLs is 8.9% of the price of a MMBtu of natural gas. The Indicative Gas Processing Gross Spread does not consider the operating and fuel costs incurred by a natural gas processing plant to extract the NGLs nor the transportation and fractionation costs to deliver the NGLs and natural gas to market. Year ended December 31, 2003 compared to year ended December 31, 2002 Revenues for 2003 increased $1.8 billion over those recorded during 2002. Likewise, costs and expenses increased $1.7 billion over those of 2002. The increase in revenues and costs and expenses is primarily due to higher product sales and purchase prices and the financial results of business acquisitions, both of which offset the effect of lower volumes at some of our pipelines and facilities. In addition, costs and expenses for 2002 includes a $51.3 million loss related to commodity hedging activities. In general, higher market prices result in increased revenues from our various marketing activities; however, these same higher prices also increase our cost of sales within these activities as feedstock and other purchase prices rise. In addition, higher natural gas market prices during 2003 increased energy-related costs for many of our businesses versus the same period in 2002. The weighted-average market price of NGLs was 57 CPG 54 during 2003 versus 41 CPG during 2002. The market price of natural gas averaged $5.38 per MMBtu during 2003 versus $3.22 per MMBtu during 2002. When compared to 2002, volumes at some of our downstream pipelines and facilities were lower due to a combination of (i) decreased demand for NGLs, principally ethane, by the ethylene segment of the petrochemical industry (the “ethylene industry”) and (ii) lower NGL extraction rates at domestic gas processing facilities. The most significant determinant of the relative economic value of NGLs is demand by the ethylene industry for use in manufacturing plastics and chemicals. During 2003, this industry operated at lower utilization rates when compared to 2002 primarily due to a recession in the domestic manufacturing sector. Also during 2003, as a result of the higher relative cost of NGLs to crude-based alternatives such as naphtha, the ethylene industry utilized crude-based feedstock alternatives in greater quantities than during 2002. The resulting weaker demand for NGLs by this industry limited the ability of NGL producers to sell at higher product prices, which in turn resulted in decreased NGL extraction rates during 2003. For information regarding our outlook for NGL demand by the petrochemical industry, please read “– Our results of operations – General outlook for 2004.” Equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $49.2 million year-to-year primarily due to a $36.4 million decrease in equity earnings from BEF. The $36.4 million decrease in equity earnings from BEF is primarily due to a $22.5 million asset impairment charge we recorded during the third quarter of 2003; increased facility downtime during 2003 for maintenance and economic reasons; and an overall decrease in MTBE sales margins. In addition to lower earnings from BEF, approximately $4.8 million of the overall decrease in equity earnings is due to a rate case settlement recorded by Starfish in 2002. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, operating income for 2003 increased $53.8 million from that posted during 2002. Total segment gross operating margin increased $78.1 million year-to-year due to the same general reasons underlying the increase in operating income. Operating income includes costs such as depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses that are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure of total segment gross operating margin. The following information highlights the significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: Pipelines. Gross operating margin from our Pipelines segment was $282.9 million for 2003 compared to $214.9 million during 2002. On an energy-equivalent basis, net pipeline throughput was 1,615 MBPD during the 2003 period versus 1,668 MBPD during the 2002 period. The increase in gross operating margin was primarily due to our acquisition of Mid-America and Seminole. These two systems earned gross operating margin of $156.3 million during 2003 on aggregate net volumes of 774 MBPD. Since we acquired interests in these systems at the end of July 2002, the 2002 period includes $81.1 million in gross operating margin for August through December 2002. When compared to their historical operating rates, net pipeline transportation volumes on the Mid-America and Seminole systems recorded for 2003 were lower than those reported by these systems for the full year of 2002 primarily due to decreased demand for NGLs, principally ethane, by the ethylene industry and lower NGL extraction rates at regional gas processing facilities. Excluding the contributions of Mid-America and Seminole, gross operating margin for the Pipelines segment was $126.6 million for 2003 versus $133.8 million for 2002. On an energy-equivalent basis (excluding Mid-America and Seminole), net pipeline throughput volumes increased to 841 MBPD during 2003 from 825 MBPD during the 2002 period. An increase in gross operating margins from our Houston Ship Channel NGL import terminal (and related HSC pipeline), the Lou-Tex NGL and Lou-Tex Propylene pipelines and our recently acquired Port Neches Pipeline partially offset a net decline in our other Gulf Coast area pipeline operations (due in part to lower NGL extraction rates at regional gas processing facilities and demand for NGLs by industry); a $4.8 million decrease in equity earnings from Starfish related to the settlement of a rate case in 2002; and a $4.1 million decrease in gross operating margins from our NGL and petrochemical storage operations due in part to higher energy-related costs and net charges associated with the measurement of liquids volumes held in storage. The 16 MBPD increase in net volumes was primarily due to higher throughput rates at our NGL import terminal (and related HSC pipeline). 55 Fractionation. Gross operating margin from our Fractionation segment was $132.8 million for 2003 compared to $129.0 million for 2002. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation improved $10.6 million year-to-year. Net NGL fractionation volumes decreased to 227 MBPD during 2003 from 235 MBPD during 2002. The increase in NGL fractionation gross operating margin is primarily due to (i) mixed NGL measurement gains we recognized during 2003 at our Mont Belvieu facility and (ii) higher percent-of-liquids revenues during 2003 at Norco attributable to the general increase in NGL prices, both of which more than offset a decline in gross operating margin from our other NGL fractionation facilities generally due to lower volumes and higher energy-related costs. The decrease in NGL fractionation volumes period-to-period was primarily due to lower NGL extraction rates at gas processing facilities and reduced demand for NGLs by the petrochemical industry. Gross operating margin from propylene fractionation declined $9.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower petrochemical marketing margins resulting from higher feedstock and energy-related operating costs. Net propylene fractionation volumes were 57 MBPD for 2003 compared to 55 MBPD during 2002. Gross operating margin from isomerization increased $4.5 million year-to-year. Isomerization volumes were 77 MBPD during the 2003 period compared to 84 MBPD during the 2002 period. The increase in gross operating margin from isomerization was generally attributable to higher isomerization fees and by-product revenues, which were partially offset by lower volumes and higher energy-related operating costs. Processing. Gross operating margin from our Processing segment was $30.3 million for 2003 compared to a gross operating margin loss of $17.6 million in 2002. Our results for 2002 include $51.3 million in commodity hedging losses, the underlying strategies of which were discontinued in 2002. Our commodity hedging results for 2003 were a loss of $0.2 million. Equity NGL production at our gas processing plants averaged 56 MBPD during 2003 compared to 73 MBPD during 2002. The decrease in equity NGL production year-to-year was largely attributable to reduced demand for NGLs, principally ethane, by the ethylene industry and higher natural gas prices relative to NGL prices, which caused most natural gas processors to minimize the amount of NGLs extracted at their facilities. To meet the natural gas processing needs of Shell (our largest natural gas processing customer) in this challenging business environment, we renegotiated certain provisions of the 20-year Shell natural gas processing agreement during the first quarter of 2003. For a general discussion of this amendment, please read “Related party transactions – Relationship with Shell” included under Item 13 of this annual report. During 2003, we renegotiated a number of our natural gas processing contracts. In general, our objective has been to convert our traditional keepwhole arrangements to either margin-band/keepwhole contracts (such as the Shell agreement referenced in the preceding paragraph), percent-of-liquids contracts or fee-based contracts. The goal of these renegotiations is to minimize our direct exposure to the volatility of natural gas prices, especially to the extent it increases the PTR cost we would pay under traditional keepwhole arrangements to the point that processing natural gas to extract NGLs becomes uneconomical for us. When NGL extraction is uneconomical, NGLs are left in the natural gas stream to the extent allowed while keeping the natural gas in compliance with pipeline quality specifications; thus reducing the amount of NGLs available for downstream activities such as pipeline transportation and NGL fractionation. For an additional discussion of our current natural gas processing contract mix and an explanation of the various types of contracts we use, please read “The Company’s Operations – Processing” included under Item 1 of this annual report. Octane enhancement. Our equity and consolidated earnings from BEF were a loss of $32.7 million for 2003 compared to equity income of $8.6 million during 2002. Net MTBE production from this facility decreased to 4 MBPD during 2003 versus 5 MBPD during 2002. The $41.3 million decrease in equity earnings is primarily due to a $22.5 million impairment charge we recorded during the third quarter of 2003 for our share of an impairment charge recorded by BEF; increased downtime during 2003 for maintenance and economic reasons; and an overall decrease in MTBE sales margins. BEF owns a facility that currently produces MTBE, a motor gasoline additive that enhances octane and is used in reformulated gasoline. The production of MTBE is primarily driven by oxygenated fuel programs enacted under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. As a result of environmental concerns, several states have enacted legislation to ban or significantly limit the use of MTBE in motor gasoline within their jurisdictions. In 56 addition, federal legislation has been drafted to ban MTBE and replace the oxygenate with renewable fuels such as ethanol. As a result of declining domestic demand and a prolonged period of weak MTBE production economics, several of BEF’s competitors have announced their withdrawal from the marketplace. Due to the deteriorating business environment and outlook and the completion of its preliminary engineering studies regarding conversion alternatives, BEF evaluated the carrying value of its long-lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2003. This review indicated that the carrying value of its long-lived assets exceeded their collective fair value, which resulted in BEF recording a non-cash impairment charge of $67.5 million. BEF’s assets were written down during the third quarter of 2003 to fair value, which was determined by independent appraisers using present value techniques. The impaired assets principally represent the plant facility and other assets associated with MTBE production. The fair value analysis incorporates future courses of action being taken (or contemplated to be taken) by BEF management, including the production of iso-octane and alkylate. If the underlying assumptions in the fair value analysis change, resulting in the present value of expected future cash flows being less than the new carrying value of the facility, additional impairment charges may result in the future. BEF is currently in the process of preparing detailed engineering plans to modify the facility to iso-octane production. The facility will continue to produce MTBE as market conditions warrant and will be capable of producing either MTBE or iso-octane once the plant modifications are complete. Depending on the outcome of various factors (including pending federal legislation) the facility may be further modified to produce alkylate. Upon our acquisition of an additional 33.3% partnership interest in BEF, it became a majority-owned consolidated subsidiary of ours on September 30, 2003. Historically, BEF was accounted for as an equity-method unconsolidated affiliate. Its results will continue to be reported under our Octane Enhancement segment. For information regarding uncertainties surrounding our investment in BEF, please read “ – Other Items -Uncertainties regarding our investment in facilities that produce MTBE.” Selling, general and administrative costs. These expenses were $37.6 million for 2003 compared to $42.9 million during 2002. The 2002 period includes approximately $10.0 million that we paid to Williams for transition services associated with our acquisition of Mid-America and Seminole compared to $2.0 million paid in 2003 for these services. These payments ceased in February 2003 when we began operating these two pipeline systems. Interest expense. Interest expense increased to $140.8 million during 2003 from $101.6 million in 2002. The increase is primarily due to additional debt we incurred as a result of business acquisitions. Our weighted-average debt principal outstanding was $2.0 billion during 2003 compared to $1.8 billion during 2002. Interest expense for 2003 includes $11.3 million of loan cost amortization related to the 364-Day Term Loan, which was incurred in July 2002 and fully repaid in February 2003. For additional information regarding our debt obligations and changes in our debt obligations since December 31, 2002, please read “ – Our liquidity and capital resources – Our debt obligations.” Year ended December 31, 2002 compared to year ended December 31, 2001 Revenues for 2002 increased $430.4 million over those for 2001. The increase is primarily due to the financial results of acquired businesses during 2002 such as the purchase of Mid-America and Seminole from Williams and propylene fractionation and NGL and petrochemical storage assets from Diamond-Koch. Costs and expenses increased $533.4 million year-to-year primarily due to the addition of costs and expenses of acquired businesses and an unfavorable change in results from our commodity hedging activities. Operating income decreased $93.1 million and gross operating margin decreased $43.6 million primarily as a result of such changes. Pipelines. Gross operating margin from our Pipelines segment was $214.9 million for 2002 compared to $96.6 million for 2001. On an energy-equivalent basis, net pipeline throughput volume for 2002 was 1,668 MBPD compared to 809 MBPD during 2001. Our acquisition of the Mid-America and Seminole NGL pipelines in July 2002 accounted for $81.1 million of the improvement in segment gross operating margin and 843 MBPD of the increase in throughput rates. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu storage businesses improved $17.9 57 million in 2002 primarily due to the acquisition of Diamond-Koch’s storage business in January 2002. Another $10.5 million of the improvement in year-to-year gross operating margin was caused by the inclusion of a full year’s results of operations from Acadian Gas in 2002, whereas 2001 included only nine months. We acquired Acadian Gas in April 2001. Fractionation. Gross operating margin from our Fractionation segment was $129.0 million for 2002 compared to $118.6 million for 2001. We expanded our propylene fractionation business in February 2002 with the acquisition of Splitter III from Diamond-Koch. Our propylene fractionation volumes increased to 55 MBPD during 2002 from 31 MBPD during 2001. Gross operating margin from these businesses increased $22.6 million year-to-year. Splitter III accounted for 25 MBPD of the increase in volumes and $24.7 million of the increase in gross operating margin. Our isomerization business posted a $4.6 million decrease in gross operating margin for 2002 when compared to 2001. Isomerization volumes increased to 84 MBPD during 2002 versus 80 MBPD during 2001. The positive effect of the higher isomerization volumes was offset by a decrease in isomerization revenues. Certain of our isomerization fees are indexed to historical natural gas prices (which were higher in 2001 relative to 2002). Lastly, gross operating margin from our NGL fractionation businesses decreased $8.1 million in 2002 when compared to 2001. NGL fractionation volumes increased to 235 MBPD during 2002 from 204 MBPD during 2001. The year-to-year decrease in NGL fractionation gross operating margin is primarily due to lower revenues from our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation facility caused by strong competition at this industry hub, partially offset by the addition of earnings from the Toca-Western facility we acquired in June 2002. Of the 31 MBPD increase in NGL fractionation volumes, 14 MBPD is due to our purchase of an additional 12.5% interest in the Mont Belvieu facility and 9 MBPD is due to the acquisition of Toca-Western. Processing. Gross operating margin from our Processing segment was a loss of $17.6 million for 2002 compared to income of $155.0 million for 2001. Of the $172.6 million change in gross operating margin, $152.6 million is due to a decrease in results from our commodity hedging activities. We recorded a loss of $51.3 million from these activities during 2002 versus income of $101.3 million during 2001. Also, gross operating margin from NGL marketing activities included in this segment benefited from unusually strong demand for propane and isobutane during early and mid-2001 which did not repeat during 2002. The year-to-year net decline in commodity hedging results and earnings from our NGL marketing activities was partially offset by a favorable decrease in NGL inventory valuation adjustments. Also, gross operating margin for 2001 includes the $10.6 million expense we recorded related to amounts owed to us by Enron, which filed for bankruptcy in December 2001. Our equity NGL production was 73 MBPD during 2002 versus 63 MBPD during 2001. The 10 MBPD increase in equity NGL production rates is primarily due to improved gas processing conditions. As noted above, the $152.6 million decrease in commodity hedging results was the primary reason for the year-to-year decline in gross operating margin from this segment. In order to manage the risks associated with our Processing segment, we may enter into short-term, highly liquid commodity financial instruments to hedge our exposure to price risks associated with natural gas, NGL production and inventories, firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions. We have employed various hedging strategies to mitigate the effects of fluctuating commodity prices (primarily NGL and natural gas prices) on our earnings from Processing segment businesses. Beginning in late 2000 and extending through March 2002, a large number of our commodity hedging transactions were based on the historical relationship between natural gas prices and NGL prices. This type of hedging strategy utilized the forward sale of natural gas at a fixed-price with the expected margin on the settlement of the position offsetting or mitigating changes in the anticipated margins on NGL marketing activities and the market values of our equity NGL production. Throughout 2001, this strategy proved very successful (as the price of natural gas declined relative to our fixed positions) and was responsible for most of the $101.3 million in commodity hedging income we recorded during 2001. In late March 2002, the effectiveness of this strategy was reduced due to an unexpected rapid increase in natural gas prices whereby the loss in the value of our fixed-price natural gas financial instruments was not offset by increased gas processing margins. Due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding natural gas prices at the time, we decided that it was prudent to exit this strategy, and we did so by late April 2002. The increased ineffectiveness of this strategy is the primary reason for the $51.3 million in commodity hedging losses recorded during 2002. A 58 variety of factors influence whether or not our hedging strategies are successful. For additional information regarding our financial instrument portfolios, please read Item 7A of this report. Octane Enhancement. Our equity earnings from BEF were $8.6 million for 2002 compared to $5.7 million for 2001. The improvement is primarily due to increased MTBE production attributable to lower maintenance downtime. On a gross basis, BEF’s MTBE production increased to 15 MBPD during 2002 compared to 14 MBPD during 2001. Other. Gross operating margin from this segment decreased $2.6 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in information technology-related facility support costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses. These expenses increased to $42.9 million during 2002 compared to $30.3 million during 2001. The increase is primarily due to the additional staff and resources needed to support our expansion activities resulting from acquisitions and other business development. The majority of the additional costs for 2002 are attributable to amounts we paid Williams for transition services associated with our acquisition of Mid-America and Seminole. Interest expense. Interest expense increased to $101.6 million during 2002 compared to $52.5 million during 2001. The increase is primarily due to debt obligations we incurred as a result of business acquisitions and investments in inventory. Of the $49.1 million increase in interest expense, $21.4 million is attributable to the debt incurred to finance the Mid-America and Seminole acquisitions. In addition, income from our interest rate hedging activities (which is recorded as a reduction in interest expense) decreased $12.3 million in 2002 when compared to 2001. The change in interest rate hedging results is primarily due to certain elections by counterparties during 2001 to terminate interest rate hedging agreements. General outlook for 2004 We expect our business to be affected by the following key trends and events during 2004. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our expectations may vary materially from actual results. • As noted earlier, the most significant determinant of the relative economic value of NGLs is demand by the ethylene industry for use in manufacturing plastics and chemicals. During 2003, this industry operated at lower utilization rates when compared to 2002 primarily due to a recession in the domestic manufacturing sector. As the domestic economy began to strengthen during the third and fourth quarters of 2003, NGL demand by the ethylene industry increased, but remained below the five-year average for these products. As we begin 2004, we are encouraged by further improvement in demand for NGLs by the ethylene industry. We have received indications from many of our largest NGL consuming customers that their operating rates and demand for NGLs should be greater in 2004 than 2003 based on the demand for their products and the prospects of a further strengthening in the domestic and global economies. If our expectations regarding demand for NGLs by the ethylene industry are met and natural gas prices remain stable, we should realize improved operating rates at many of our facilities and pipelines. • Our overall results of operations and financial position during 2004 will be affected by the timing and successful completion of our proposed merger with GulfTerra. The assets of the proposed combined partnership would include over 30,000 miles of pipelines comprised of over 17,000 miles of natural gas pipelines, 13,000 miles of NGL pipelines and 340 miles of offshore Gulf of Mexico large capacity crude oil pipelines. The combined partnership’s other logistical assets would also include ownership interests in 164 MMBbls of NGL storage capacity and 23 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity, seven offshore Gulf of Mexico hub platforms, and import and export terminals on the Houston Ship Channel. The combined partnership would also own interests in 19 fractionation plants with a net capacity 650 MBPD and 24 natural gas processing plants with a net capacity of 6.0 Bcf/d. 59 We believe the assets and businesses of these two partnerships are complementary. We believe the scale and business opportunities for the combined partnership would provide us with a number of avenues to create value for our unitholders and our producing and consuming customers. We are working to complete the merger as soon as possible. A number of conditions must be satisfied before we can complete the merger, including approval by the unitholders of both Enterprise and GulfTerra and the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1974. While we cannot predict if and when all of the conditions to the merger will be satisfied, we expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2004. For additional information regarding the proposed merger, please read “ – Recent Developments” beginning on page 49. • As a result of our acquisition of a 50% interest in GulfTerra GP in December 2003, our equity earnings from this investment will increase earnings from the Pipelines segment and increase cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. This acquisition is Step One of our proposed merger with GulfTerra. For additional information regarding the proposed merger with GulfTerra, please read “ – Recent Developments.” During February 2004, we received the first quarterly cash distribution from GulfTerra GP, which was approximately $10.6 million. Future distributions and earnings from GulfTerra GP will be dependent on the declared distribution rates and operating results of GulfTerra. • Earnings from our Octane Enhancement business will continue to be subject to MTBE sales margins until our iso-octane project is completed. Several states, including California, New York and Connecticut, implemented MTBE bans on January 1, 2004. Although these bans have weakened overall demand for MTBE, several MTBE suppliers exited the industry during 2003. The reduced supply for MTBE during 2004 should help to stabilize prices over the short-term while we work to convert the facility to iso-octane production. We are currently in the process of modifying BEF’s MTBE production facility to produce iso-octane, a motor gasoline octane enhancement additive derived from isobutane. We expect iso-octane demand by refiners to replace octane volume that is lost as a result of MTBE being eliminated as a motor gasoline blendstock. Our modification project is expected to be complete during the third quarter of 2004. The facility will continue to produce MTBE as market conditions warrant and will be capable of producing either MTBE or iso-octane once the plant modifications are complete. Our isomerization rates related to BEF will depend on the extent that MTBE and iso-octane are produced (both products use isobutane as a feedstock). For additional information regarding our Octane Enhancement business including regulatory and environmental matters, please read “The Company’s Operations – Octane Enhancement” included under Item 1 of this annual report. 60 OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES General Our primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses and debt service, are for capital expenditures (both sustaining and expansion-related), business acquisitions and distributions to our partners. We expect to fund our short-term needs for such items as operating expenses and sustaining capital expenditures with operating cash flows. Capital expenditures for long-term needs resulting from internal growth projects and business acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources including (either separately or in combination) cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under commercial bank credit facilities, the issuance of additional partnership equity and public or private placement debt. We expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash flows. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and/or refinancing arrangements. As noted above, certain of our liquidity and capital resource requirements are fulfilled by borrowings made under debt agreements and/or proceeds from the issuance of additional partnership equity. At December 31, 2003, we had approximately $2.1 billion in principal outstanding under various debt agreements. On that date, total borrowing capacity under our revolving commercial bank credit facilities was $500 million of which $315 million was unused. For additional information regarding our debt, please read “ – Our debt obligations.” In February 2001, we filed a universal shelf registration with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $500 million of partnership equity or public debt obligations. In October 2002, we sold 9,800,000 common units under this shelf registration statement which generated $182.5 million of cash to us (including related capital contributions from our General Partner). In January 2003, we sold an additional 14,662,500 common units under this shelf registration which generated $258.1 million of cash to us (including related capital contributions from our General Partner). We used the cash generated by these equity offerings to reduce debt outstanding under our 364-Day Term Loan and for working capital purposes. Also, in January and February 2003, we issued Senior Notes C ($350 million principal amount) and Senior Notes D ($500 million principal amount), respectively. For information regarding our application of cash obtained through these debt offerings, please read “ – Our debt obligations.” In January 2003, we filed a new $1.5 billion universal shelf registration statement with the SEC covering the issuance of an unallocated amount of partnership equity or public debt obligations (separately or in combination). In June 2003, we sold 11,960,000 common units under this shelf registration statement, which generated $261.1 million of cash to us (including related capital contributions from our General Partner). We used the cash generated by this equity offering to reduce debt outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. As a result of meeting certain financial tests, the Subordination Period (as defined in our partnership agreement), with respect to our subordinated units, ended on August 1, 2003. With the expiration of the Subordination Period, we may prudently issue an unlimited number of units for general partnership purposes. In July 2003, we filed a registration statement with the SEC covering our Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the “DRP”). The DRP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they would otherwise receive in the purchase of additional common units. Currently, the registration statement covers the issuance of up to 5,000,000 common units under the DRP. As a result of reinvestment proceeds from our limited partners under the DRP, our General Partner will be required to make cash capital contributions to us in order to maintain its ownership interest. We expect to use the cash generated from this reinvestment program for general partnership purposes. Initial reinvestments under the DRP occurred in August 2003. For all of 2003, we issued 2,883,803 common units in connection with the DRP and received proceeds of approximately $60.3 million. EPCO’s reinvestment accounted for approximately $55.0 million of the $60.3 million reinvested during 2003. To support our growth objectives and financial flexibility, EPCO has announced that it expects to reinvest under the DRP an additional $140 million of its cash distributions from the first quarter of 2004 through the first quarter of 2005. As a result, we are preparing to increase the number of common units that can be issued under the DRP to approximately 15,000,000 common units. 61 In December 2003, we sold 4,413,549 Class B special units to an affiliate of EPCO for $100 million in a private transaction. Our General Partner contributed approximately $2 million in connection with this offering in order to maintain its ownership interest. We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay $100 million of the debt we incurred to finance our December 2003 purchase of a 50% interest in GulfTerra GP and the remainder for general partnership purposes. If deemed necessary, we believe that additional financing arrangements can be obtained on reasonable terms. Furthermore, we believe that maintenance of our investment grade credit ratings combined with a continued ready access to debt and equity capital at reasonable rates and sufficient trade credit to operate our businesses efficiently provide a solid foundation to meet our long and short-term liquidity and capital resource requirements. The following discussions highlight significant year-to-year comparisons in consolidated operating, investing and financing cash flows: For Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net income $ 104,546 $ 95,500 $ 242,178 Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash flows provided by (used for) operating activities before changes in operating accounts: Depreciation and amortization 128,434 94,925 51,903 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 13,960 (35,253) (25,358) Distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates 31,882 57,662 45,054 Changes in fair market value of financial instruments (29) 10,213 (5,697) Other 25,024 14,059 12,391 Cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating accounts $ 303,817 $ 237,106 $ 320,471 Net effect of changes in operating accounts 120,888 92,655 (37,143) Operating activities cash flows $ 424,705 $ 329,761 $ 283,328 Operating cash flows primarily reflect net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization, equity earnings and cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, fluctuations in the fair value of financial instruments and changes in operating accounts. The net effect of changes in operating accounts is generally the result of timing of sales and purchases near the end of each period. Cash flow from operations is primarily based on earnings from our business activities. As a result, these cash flows are exposed to certain risks. The products that we process, sell or transport are principally used as feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing, in the production of motor gasoline and as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating. Reduced demand for our products or services by industrial customers, whether because of general economic conditions, reduced demand for the end products made with our products, increased competition from petroleum-based products due to pricing differences or other reasons, could have a negative impact on our earnings and thus the availability of cash from operating activities. Other risks include fluctuations in NGL and energy prices, competitive practices in the midstream energy industry and the impact of operational and systems risks. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, please read “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors” included under Item 1 of this annual report. Year ended December 31, 2003 compared to year ended December 31, 2002 Operating cash flows. Cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of $424.7 million during 2003 compared to an inflow of $329.8 million during 2002. As shown in the preceding table, cash flow before the net effect of changes in operating accounts was an inflow of $303.8 million during 2003 versus $237.1 million during 2002. We believe that cash flow from operating activities before the net effect of changes in operating accounts is an important measure of our ability to generate core cash flows from our assets and other investments. The $66.7 million increase in this element of our cash flows is primarily due to: • earnings from newly acquired businesses in the 2003 period but not in the 2002 period (particularly those of Mid-America and Seminole, which we acquired in July 2002); • the 2002 period including $51.3 million of commodity hedging losses versus $0.6 million of such losses during the 2003 period; offset by 62 • higher interest costs associated with debt we incurred and issued since the first quarter of 2002 to finance acquisitions. The $33.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to additional businesses acquired since the first quarter of 2002. The net effect of changes in operating accounts is generally the result of timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for inventory, purchases and other expenses near the end of each period. For additional information regarding changes in operating accounts, please read Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Investing cash flows. During 2003, we used $657.0 million in cash for investing activities compared to $1.7 billion during 2002. We used $37.3 million and $1.6 billion for business acquisitions during 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2002 period reflects our acquisition of interests in the Mid-America and Seminole pipelines from Williams and propylene fractionation and NGL and petrochemical storage assets from Diamond-Koch. The 2003 period includes only minor acquisitions, specifically the Port Neches pipeline and additional interests in EPIK, BEF, Wilprise and OTC. Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates increased to $471.9 million during 2003 compared to $13.7 million during 2002. The 2003 period includes our payment of $425 million to El Paso for a 50% ownership interest in the general partner of GulfTerra in December 2003. The remaining $33.2 million year-to-year increase is primarily due to funding our share of the expansion projects of our Gulf of Mexico natural gas pipeline investments and our purchase of an additional interest in Tri-States. Our capital expenditures were $145.9 million during 2003 versus $72.1 million during 2002. The $73.8 million increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to expansions of our Norco NGL fractionator and Neptune gas processing facility. Financing cash flows. Our financing activities were a cash inflow of $248.9 million during 2003 compared to an inflow of $1.3 billion during 2002. During 2003, we made net payments on our debt obligations of $106.8 million. Our borrowings during 2003 include the issuance of Senior Notes C ($350 million in principal amount), Senior Notes D ($500 million in principal amount) and the $425 million borrowing under the Interim Term Loan (to purchase a 50% interest in the general partner of GulfTerra). Our repayments during 2003 include the use of proceeds from equity offerings completed in January, June, August and December. The 2002 period primarily reflects borrowings to fund the Mid-America and Seminole acquisitions and those of Diamond-Koch’s propylene fractionation business. Proceeds from our common unit and Class B special unit equity offerings during 2003 totaled $675.7 million, which includes our General Partner’s related $7.8 million contribution to us. Our General Partner also contributed $5.9 million to our Operating Partnership in connection with these offerings. Distributions to our partners and minority interests increased to $318.0 million during 2003 from $218.2 million during 2002. The $99.8 million increase in distributions to partners is primarily due to increases in both the declared quarterly distribution rates and the number of units eligible for distributions. Year ended December 31, 2002 compared to year ended December 31, 2001 Operating cash flows. Cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of $329.8 million during 2002 compared to $283.3 million during 2001. As shown in the preceding table, cash flow before changes in operating accounts was an inflow of $237.1 million during 2002 versus $320.5 million during 2001. The $83.4 million year-to-year decrease in this element of our cash flows is primarily due to net hedging losses in 2002 versus net hedging income in 2001 offset by increased distributions from unconsolidated affiliates and earnings from businesses we acquired during 2002. The $43.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to businesses we acquired during 2002. Changes in operating accounts are generally the result of timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for inventory, purchases and other expenses near the end of each period. For additional information regarding changes in operating accounts, please read Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 63 Investing cash flows. During 2002, we used $1.7 billion in cash for investing activities compared to $491.2 million during 2001. Fiscal 2002 reflects $1.6 billion of business acquisitions including $1.2 billion paid to acquire Mid-America and Seminole and $368.7 million paid to acquire Diamond-Koch’s Mont Belvieu, Texas propylene fractionation and NGL and petrochemical storage businesses. Fiscal 2001 includes $113.0 million paid to acquire equity interests in four Gulf of Mexico natural gas pipelines from El Paso and $225.7 million paid to acquire Acadian Gas from Shell. During 2002, our capital expenditures were $72.1 million compared to $149.9 million during 2001. The majority of capital expenditures made during both periods were for projects within our Pipelines segment. Financing cash flows. Our financing activities generated $1.3 billion in cash inflows during 2002 compared to $279.5 million during 2001. Our net borrowings were $1.3 billion in 2002 versus $449.7 million in 2001. The increase in borrowings is primarily due to acquisitions, particularly the $1.2 billion paid for Mid-America and Seminole and the $239.0 million for Diamond-Koch’s propylene fractionation business. The borrowing shown for 2001 reflects the issuance of our Senior Notes B, which was primarily used to finance the acquisition of Acadian Gas, Starfish, Neptune and Nemo. Financing activities also reflect the net proceeds and related General Partner contributions from our October 2002 issuance of 9,800,000 new common units. Net proceeds from the sale of the common units were $182.5 million. This amount includes the General Partner’s aggregate contribution to us and our Operating Partnership of $3.7 million to maintain its combined 2% general partner interest. Cash distributions to our partners and minority interests increased $52.2 million year-to-year primarily due to increases in both the declared quarterly distribution rates and the number of units eligible for distributions. The number of units eligible for distributions was higher in 2002 due to the conversion of 19.0 million of Shell’s Class A special units to an equal number of common units in August 2002 and our issuance of the 9.8 million new common units in October 2002. Debt issuance costs increased $16.2 million year-to-year primarily due to the $15.0 million in fees we paid to lenders in July 2002 associated with the short-term financing of the Mid-America and Seminole acquisitions. 64 Our debt obligations Our debt consisted of the following at the dates indicated: December 31, 2003 2002 Borrowings under: 364-Day Term Loan, variable rate, repaid during 2003 (1) $ 1,022,000 Interim Term Loan, variable rate, due the earlier of September 2004 or the date that our proposed merger with GulfTerra is completed $ 225,000 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility, variable rate, due October 2004, $230 million borrowing capacity 70,000 99,000 Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility, variable rate, due November 2005, $270 million borrowing capacity (2) 115,000 225,000 Senior Notes A, 8.25% fixed rate, due March 2005 350,000 350,000 Seminole Notes, 6.67% fixed rate, $15 million due each December, 2002 through 2005 (3) 30,000 45,000 MBFC Loan, 8.70% fixed rate, due March 2010 54,000 54,000 Senior Notes B, 7.50% fixed rate, due February 2011 450,000 450,000 Senior Notes C, 6.375% fixed rate, due February 2013 350,000 Senior Notes D, 6.875% fixed rate, due March 2033 500,000 Total principal amount 2,144,000 2,245,000 Unamortized balance of increase in fair value related to hedging a portion of fixed-rate debt 1,531 1,774 Less unamortized discounts on Senior Notes A, B and D (5,983) (311) Subtotal long-term debt 2,139,548 2,246,463 Less current maturities of debt (4) (240,000) (15,000) Long-term debt (4) $ 1,899,548 $ 2,231,463 Standby letters of credit outstanding, $75 million of credit capacity available under our Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility (2) $ 1,300 $ 2,400 (1) We used a combination of proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes C and D and the October 2002 and January 2003 common unit offerings to fully repay this $1.2 billion facility in February 2003. (2) This facility has $270 million of total borrowing capacity, which is reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit outstanding. (3) As to the assets of our subsidiary, Seminole Pipeline Company, our $2.1 billion in senior indebtedness at December 31, 2003 is structurally subordinated and ranks junior in right of payment to the $30 million of indebtedness of Seminole Pipeline Company. (4) In accordance with SFAS No. 6, “Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to Be Refinanced,” long-term and current maturities of debt at December 31, 2003 reflect the classification of such debt obligations at March 1, 2004. With respect to our 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings under this facility are not included in current maturities because we have the option and ability to convert any revolving credit balance outstanding at maturity to a one-year term loan (due October 2005) in accordance with the terms of the agreement. For scheduled future maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2003, please read “ – Our contractual obligations.” Parent-subsidiary guarantor relationships We act as guarantor of all of our Operating Partnership’s consolidated debt obligations, with the exception of the Seminole Notes. If the Operating Partnership were to default on any debt we guarantee, we would be 65 responsible for full repayment of that obligation. The Seminole Notes are unsecured obligations of Seminole Pipeline Company (of which we own an effective 78.4% of its capital stock). General description of debt The following is a summary of the significant aspects of our debt obligations at December 31, 2003. Interim Term Loan. In December 2003, our Operating Partnership entered into a $225 million acquisition-related term loan to partially finance our $425 million purchase from El Paso of a 50% membership interest in GulfTerra GP. The maturity date of this term loan is the earlier of September 2004 or the date our proposed merger with GulfTerra is completed. The Operating Partnership’s borrowings under this agreement are unsecured general obligations that are non-recourse to our General Partner. We have guaranteed repayment of amounts due under this term loan through an unsecured guarantee. As defined by the agreement, variable interest rates charged under this facility generally bear interest at either, at our election, (1) the greater of (a) the Prime Rate or (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus ½% or (2) a Eurodollar rate. Whichever base rate we select, the rate is increased by an appropriate applicable margin (as defined in the loan agreement). For information regarding variable-interest rates paid under this term loan agreement, please read “ – Information regarding variable-interest rates paid.” This term loan agreement contains various covenants related to our ability to incur certain indebtedness; grant certain liens; enter into certain merger or consolidation transactions; and make certain investments. The loan agreement also requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants at the end of each fiscal quarter. If an event of default (as defined in the agreement) occurs, the Operating Partnership will be prohibited from making distributions to us, which would impair our ability to make distributions to our partners. As defined in the agreement, we must maintain a specified level of consolidated net worth and certain financial ratios. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2003. 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility. In October 2003, our Operating Partnership entered into new 364-day revolving credit agreement that contained essentially the same terms as our November 2002 364-Day revolving credit agreement that expired in November 2003. The stand-alone borrowing capacity under the new revolving credit facility is $230 million with the maturity date for any amount outstanding being October 2004. We have the option to convert any revolving credit balance outstanding at maturity to a one-year term loan (due October 2005) in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. The Operating Partnership’s borrowings under this agreement are unsecured general obligations that are non-recourse to our General Partner. We have guaranteed repayment of amounts due under this term loan through an unsecured guarantee. As defined by the agreement, variable interest rates charged under this facility generally bear interest at either, at our election, (1) the greater of (a) the Prime Rate or (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus ½% or (2) a Eurodollar rate. Whichever base rate we select, the rate is increased by an appropriate applicable margin (as defined within the loan agreement). We elect the basis of the interest rate at the time of each borrowing. For information regarding variable-interest rates paid under this revolving credit agreement, please read “ – Information regarding variable-interest rates paid.” This revolving credit agreement contains various covenants similar to those of our Interim Term Loan (please refer to our discussion regarding restrictive covenants of the Interim Term Loan within this “General description of debt” section). We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2003. Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In November 2002, our Operating Partnership entered into a five-year revolving credit facility that includes a sublimit of $75 million for standby letters of credit. Currently, the stand-alone borrowing capacity under this revolving credit facility is $270 million. The Operating Partnership’s borrowings under this agreement are unsecured general obligations that are non-recourse to our General Partner. We have guaranteed repayment of amounts due under this term loan through an unsecured guarantee. As defined by the agreement, variable interest rates charged under this facility generally bear interest at either, at our election, (1) the greater of (a) the Prime Rate or (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus ½% or (2) a 66 Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or (3) a Competitive Bid Rate. We elect the basis of the interest rate at the time of each borrowing. For information regarding variable-interest rates paid under this revolving credit agreement, please read “ – Information regarding variable-interest rates paid.” This revolving credit agreement contains various covenants similar to those of our Interim Term Loan (please refer to our discussion regarding restrictive covenants of the Interim Term Loan within this “General description of debt” section). We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2003. Senior Notes A, B, C and D. These fixed-rate notes are an unsecured obligation of our Operating Partnership and rank equally with its existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. They are senior to any future subordinated indebtedness. The Operating Partnership’s borrowings under these notes are non-recourse to our General Partner. We have guaranteed repayment of amounts due under these notes through an unsecured and unsubordinated guarantee. These notes are subject to make-whole redemption rights and were issued under an indenture containing certain covenants. These covenants restrict our ability, with certain exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2003. In January 2003, we issued $350 million in principal amount of 6.375% fixed-rate senior notes due February 2013 (“Senior Notes C”), from which we received net proceeds before offering expenses of approximately $347.7 million. These private placement notes were sold at face value with no discount or premium. We used the proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the 364-Day Term Loan that we incurred to finance the Mid-America and Seminole acquisitions. In May 2003, we exchanged 100% of the private placement Senior Notes C for publicly registered Senior Notes C. In February 2003, we issued $500 million in principal amount of 6.875% fixed-rate senior notes due March 2033 (“Senior Notes D”), from which we received net proceeds before offering expenses of approximately $489.8 million. These private placement notes were sold at 98.842% of their face amount. We used $421.4 million from this offering to repay the remaining principal balance outstanding under the 364-Day Term Loan. In addition, we applied $60.0 million of the proceeds to reduce the balance outstanding under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility. The remaining proceeds were used for working capital purposes. In July 2003, we exchanged 100% of the private placement Senior Notes D for publicly registered Senior Notes D. Repayment of 364-Day Term Loan In July 2002, our Operating Partnership entered into the $1.2 billion senior unsecured 364-Day Term Loan to fund the acquisition of interests in the Mid-America and Seminole pipelines. We used $178.5 million of the $182.5 million in proceeds from our October 2002 equity offering to partially repay this loan. We also used $252.8 million of the $258.1 million in proceeds from the January 2003 equity offering, $347.0 million of the $347.7 million in proceeds from our issuance of Senior Notes C and $421.4 million in proceeds from our issuance of Senior Notes D to fully repay the 364-Day Term Loan in February 2003. 67 Information regarding variable-interest rates paid The following table shows the range of interest rates paid and weighted-average interest rate paid on our variable-rate debt obligations during 2003. Range of interest rates paid Weighted- average interest rate paid 364-Day Term Loan (1) 2.59% - 2.88% 2.85% 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility 1.79% - 4.75% 2.48% Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility 1.64% - 4.25% 1.87% Interim Term Loan 1.77% - 4.00% 2.16% (1) This facility was fully repaid in February 2003. Credit ratings Our current senior unsecured credit ratings are Baa2 as rated by Moody’s Investor Services and BBB- as rated by Standard and Poor’s, both are investment grade. On December 15, 2003 as the result of our execution of definitive agreements with GulfTerra and El Paso to merge with GulfTerra, Moody’s put our rating under review for possible downgrade and Standard and Poor’s placed our rating on credit watch with negative implications. Both debt rating agencies will be reviewing the credit attributes and the risk profile of the merged partnership as well as the execution risk of the permanent financing of the proposed merger. On November 26, 2003, our senior unsecured credit rating as rated by Standard and Poor’s was lowered from BBB to BBB- with a negative outlook. Standard and Poor’s indicated that the negative outlook reflected their concern that the rebound in NGL demand was temporary and that weak demand could return in 2004. Standard and Poor’s also indicated that our rating was subject to downgrade if our financial performance in 2004 was less than the then current expectations. Standard and Poor’s cited concerns regarding our financial performance during the second and third quarters of 2003 and the sustainability of increased NGL demand by the petrochemical industry during 2004. Standard and Poor’s indicated that it was also evaluating what effect, if any, that EPCO’s purchase of Shell’s interest in our General Partner might have on our overall credit quality. We believe that the maintenance of an investment grade credit rating is important in managing our liquidity and capital resource requirements. We maintain regular communications with these ratings agencies, each of which independently judges our creditworthiness based on a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors. Capital spending forecasts At December 31, 2003, we had $4.0 million in estimated outstanding purchase commitments attributable to capital projects, practically all of which were related to the construction of assets that will be recorded as property, plant and equipment. During 2004, we expect capital spending on internal growth projects to approximate $87 million, of which $42 million is projected to be spent on projects within our Pipelines segment and approximately $30 million on the conversion of the MTBE facility to dual use MTBE and iso-octane production. We expect to invest approximately $8 million in the projects of our unconsolidated affiliates during 2004, of which $6 million is attributable to projects of our Gulf of Mexico natural gas pipeline investments. EPCO subleases to us all of the equipment it holds pursuant to operating leases relating to an isomerization unit, a deisobutanizer tower, a cogeneration unit and approximately 100 railcars for one dollar per year and has assigned to us its purchase option under such leases (the “retained leases”). EPCO remains liable for the lease payments associated with these items. We have notified the original lessor of the isomerization unit of our intent to exercise the purchase option assigned to us. Under the terms of the lease agreement for the isomerization unit, we have the option to purchase the equipment at the lesser of fair value or $23.1 million. 68 Pipeline Integrity Management Program Our NGL, petrochemical and gas pipelines are subject to the pipeline safety program established by the 1996 federal Pipeline Safety Act and its implementing regulations. The U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Office of Pipeline Safety (“OPS”), is responsible for developing, issuing and enforcing regulations relating to the design, construction, inspection, testing, operation, replacement and management of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. In 2001 OPS issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for oil pipelines (which includes NGL and petrochemical pipelines such as ours) in certain “high consequence areas.” High consequence areas include but are not limited to high population areas, environmentally sensitive locations, and areas containing drinking water supplies. In connection with these regulations, we developed a Pipeline Integrity Management Program and, by the end of 2002, had identified the segments of our liquids pipelines that were located in such areas. The regulations stipulate that a pipeline company must assess the condition of its pipelines in such areas and perform any necessary repairs. We are required to evaluate at least 50% of our identified pipeline mileage in such high consequence areas by the end of 2004 with the balance completed before April 2008. After this initial testing is complete, the identified pipeline segments must be reassessed every five years thereafter. On November 15, 2002, Congress passed the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act, which contains requirements for the development of integrity management programs on gas pipelines located in certain “high consequence areas,” and effective February 14, 2004, OPS adopted regulations to implement this statute. The new regulations require gas pipeline operators to develop by December 17, 2004, integrity management programs for gas transmission pipelines that could impact high consequence areas in the event of a failure. We anticipate that our implementation of the gas pipeline regulations will proceed on a timely basis. During 2003, we spent approximately $10 million to comply with these new regulations, of which $4.5 million was expensed. During each of the years 2004 through 2008, our cash outlays for this program are expected to be in the range of $12 million to $23 million. At present, we expect that approximately 85% of these future expenditures will be recorded as operating expenses within our Pipelines segment. 69 OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands): Payment or Settlement due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Time period (2004) (2005 - 2006) (2007 - 2008) Beyond 2008 Long-term debt, including current maturities (1) $2,144,000 $ 240,000 $550,000 $1,354,000 Operating lease obligations (2) $ 47,197 $ 8,928 $ 8,076 $ 7,130 $ 23,063 Purchase obligations: (3) Product purchase commitments: (4) Estimated payment obligations: Natural gas $1,079,876 $ 150,620 $233,466 $231,930 $ 463,860 NGLs $ 131,904 $ 15,745 $ 17,870 $ 17,870 $ 80,419 Petrochemicals $1,149,987 $ 425,971 $700,345 $ 23,671 Other $ 75,455 $ 45,996 $ 23,889 $ 4,414 $ 1,156 Underlying major volume commitments: Natural gas (in BBtus) 164,032 23,602 35,310 35,040 70,080 NGLs (in MBbls) 5,333 578 732 732 3,291 Petrochemicals (in MBbls) 36,892 13,696 22,442 754 Service payment commitments (5) $ 552 $ 382 $ 170 Capital expenditure commitment (6) $ 4,003 $ 4,003 Other Long-term liabilities, as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet (7) $ 14,081 $ 860 $ 11,078 $ 2,143 (1) We have long and short-term payment obligations under credit agreements such as our senior notes and revolving credit facilities. Amounts shown in the table represent our scheduled future maturities of long-term debt (including current maturities thereof) for the periods indicated. For additional information regarding our debt obligations, please read “ - Our liquidity and capital resources – Our debt obligations.” (2) We lease certain property, plant and equipment under noncancelable and cancelable operating leases. Amounts shown in the table represent minimum lease payment obligations under our third-party operating leases with terms in excess of one year for the periods indicated. (3) We define a purchase obligation as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (unconditional) on us that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. (4) We have long and short-term product purchase obligations for NGLs, petrochemicals and natural gas with several third-party suppliers. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. Amounts shown in the table represent our volume commitments and estimated payment obligations under these contracts for the periods indicated. Our estimated future payment obligations are based on the contractual price under each contract for purchases made at December 31, 2003 applied to future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on market prices at the time of delivery. (5) We have long and short-term commitments to pay third-party service providers for services such as maintenance agreements. Our contractual payment obligations vary by contract. The table shows our future payment obligations under these service contracts. (6) We have short-term payment obligations relating to capital projects we have initiated and are also responsible for our share of such obligations associated with capital projects of our unconsolidated affiliates. These commitments represent unconditional payment obligations that we or our unconsolidated affiliates have agreed to pay vendors for services rendered or products purchased. (7) We have recorded long-term liabilities on our balance sheet reflecting amounts we expect to pay in future periods beyond one year. These liabilities primarily relate to reserves for joint venture audits, major maintenance accruals related to our MTBE facility, environmental liabilities and other amounts. Amounts shown in the table represent our best estimate as to the timing of payments. 70 The operating lease commitments shown in the preceding table exclude the non-cash related party expense associated with various equipment leases contributed to us by EPCO at our formation for which EPCO has retained the liability (the “retained leases”). The retained leases are accounted for as operating leases by EPCO. EPCO’s minimum future rental payments under these leases are $12.1 million in 2004, $2.1 million for each of the years 2005 through 2008, $0.7 million for each of the years 2009 through 2015 and $0.3 million for 2016. EPCO has assigned to us the purchase options associated with the retained leases. We notified the lessor of the isomerization unit associated with the retained leases of our intent to exercise the purchase option relating to this equipment in 2004. Under the terms of the lease agreement for the isomerization unit, we have the option to purchase the equipment at the lesser of fair value or $23.1 million. Should we decide to exercise all of the remaining purchase options associated with the retained leases (which are at fair value), up to an additional $2.8 million would be payable in 2004, $2.3 million in 2008 and $3.1 million in 2016. For additional information regarding the retained leases, please read Item 13 of this annual report on Form 10-K. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2003. This statement establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) liability and the associated asset retirement cost. Our adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial statements. For a discussion regarding our implementation of this new standard, please read Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections.” We adopted provisions of this standard as of January 1, 2003. This statement revised accounting guidance related to the extinguishment of debt and accounting for certain lease transactions. It also amended other accounting literature to clarify its meaning, applicability and to make various technical corrections. Our adoption of this standard has had no material impact on our financial statements. SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit and Disposal Activities.” We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2003. This statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Our adoption of this standard has had no material impact on our financial statements. SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” We adopted this standard as of December 31, 2002. This statement provides alternative methods of transition from a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” in both annual and interim financial statements. We have provided the information required by this statement in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Apart from this additional footnote disclosure, our adoption of this standard has had no material impact on our financial statements. SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” We adopted SFAS No. 149 on a prospective basis as of July 1, 2003. This statement amends and clarifies accounting guidance for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003, and to certain preexisting contracts. Our adoption of this standard has had no material impact on our financial statements. SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.” We adopted this standard on July 1, 2003. This standard establishes classification and measurement standards for financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires an issuer of such financial instruments to reclassify the instrument from equity to a liability or an asset. Our adoption of this standard has had no material impact on our financial statements. 71 FIN 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirement from Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” We implemented this FASB interpretation as of December 31, 2002. This interpretation of SFAS No. 5, 57 and 107, and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We have provided the information required by this interpretation in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our implementation of this interpretation has had no material impact on our financial statements. FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities – An Interpretation of ARB No. 51.” This interpretation of ARB No. 51 addresses requirements for accounting consolidation of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) with its primary beneficiary. In general, if an equity owner of a VIE meets certain criteria defined within FIN 46, the assets, liabilities and results of the activities of the VIE should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the owner. Our adoption of FIN 46 (as amended by FIN46R) in 2003 has had no material effect on our financial statements. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In our financial reporting process, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates should the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following describes the estimation risk in each of these significant financial statement items: Depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated using the straight-line method over the asset’s estimated useful life. Our plants, pipelines and storage facilities have estimated useful lives of five to 35 years. Our miscellaneous transportation equipment have estimated useful lives of three to 10 years. Depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. Straight-line depreciation results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the asset. The determination of an asset’s estimated useful life must take a number of factors into consideration, including technological change, normal depreciation and actual physical usage. If any of these assumptions subsequently change, the estimated useful life of the asset could change and result in an increase or decrease in depreciation expense. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. We recorded $101.0 million and $72.5 million in depreciation expense during 2003 and 2002, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, please read Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Impairment charges and underlying estimated fair values If we determine that an asset’s undepreciated cost may not be recoverable due to impairment of the asset, then we are required to take a charge against earnings. Long-lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through future expected cash flows are written-down to their estimated fair values. An asset is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the existing asset. Our estimates of such undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and salvage values. If we initially determine that an asset’s carrying value is recoverable through such undiscounted estimated cash flows and later revise these assumptions and determine that the opposite is true, we would be required to ascertain the fair value of the facility, which might ultimately result in an impairment charge being recorded. 72 If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the sum of its undiscounted expected cash flows, an impairment loss equal to the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset is recognized. The quoted market price of an asset on an active exchange or similar venue is the best determinant of fair value. However, in many instances, quoted market prices in such markets are not available. In those instances, the estimate of fair value is based on the best information available, including prices for similar assets and the results of using other valuation techniques (including present value techniques). Since most of our plant and other fixed and intangible assets are not traded in an active market, we generally rely on the use of present value techniques when determining the fair value of such assets for the purpose of impairment testing. These techniques incorporate our best available information and assumptions regarding future cash flows, alternative courses of action, probabilities of such courses of action occurring and discount rates. To the extent that any of these underlying assumptions prove incorrect, we may be required to take additional impairment charges in the future. Due to a deteriorating business environment and outlook and the completion of its preliminary engineering studies regarding conversion alternatives, BEF evaluated the carrying value of its long-lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2003. This review indicated that the carrying value of BEF’s long-lived assets exceeded their collective fair value, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $67.5 million. Our share of this loss is $22.5 million and is recorded as a component of “Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates” in our Statements of Consolidated Operations and Comprehensive Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003. Our historical equity (and in the future, consolidated) earnings from BEF are classified under the Octane Enhancement business segment. For additional information regarding this impairment charge, please read Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Amortization methods and estimated useful lives of qualifying intangible assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential intangible assets include intellectual property such as technology, patents, trademarks and trade names, customer contracts and relationships, and non-compete agreements, as well as other intangible assets. The approach to the valuation of each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset, the business in which it is utilized, and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. Our recorded intangible assets primarily include the estimated value assigned to certain contract-based assets representing the rights we own arising from contractual agreements. A contract-based intangible with a finite useful life is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the entity. It is based on an analysis of all pertinent factors including (1) the expected use of the asset by the entity, (2) the expected useful life of related assets (i.e., fractionation facility, storage well, etc.), (3) any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions, including renewal or extension periods that would not cause substantial costs or modifications to existing agreements, (4) the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors and (5) the level of maintenance required to obtain the expected future cash flows. If the underlying assumption(s) governing the amortization of an intangible asset were later determined to have significantly changed (either favorably or unfavorably), then we may be required to adjust the amortization period of such asset to reflect any new estimate of its useful life. Such a change would increase or decrease the annual amortization charge associated with the asset at that time. During 2002, we did not find it necessary to adjust the estimated useful life or amortization period of any of our intangible assets. Should any of the underlying assumptions indicate that the value of the intangible asset might be impaired, we may be required to reduce the carrying value and subsequent useful life of the asset. Any such write-down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life (i.e., amortization period) of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was $268.9 million and $277.7 million, respectively. We did not recognize any impairment losses related to our intangible assets during 73 2003 or 2002. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, please read Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Methods we employ to measure the fair value of goodwill Our goodwill is attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and is primarily comprised of the $73.6 million associated with the purchase of propylene fractionation assets from Diamond-Koch in February 2002. Since our adoption of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” on January 1, 2002, our goodwill amounts are no longer amortized. Instead, goodwill is tested annually at a reporting unit level, and goodwill is tested more frequently if certain circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. If such indicators are present (i.e., loss of a significant customer, economic obsolescence of plant assets, etc.), then the fair value of the reporting unit, including its related goodwill, is calculated and compared to its combined book value. Currently, our goodwill is primarily recorded as part of the Fractionation operating segment (based on the assets to which the goodwill relates). If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value, then goodwill is not considered impaired and no adjustment to earnings would be required. Should the fair value of the reporting unit (including its goodwill) be less than its book value, a charge to earnings would be recorded to adjust goodwill to its implied fair value. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the carrying value of our goodwill was $82.4 million and $81.5 million, respectively. For additional information regarding our goodwill, please read Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our investment in Dixie and GulfTerra GP exceeded our share of the historical cost of the underlying net assets of such entities (“excess cost”). The excess cost of these investments is reflected in our investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates for these entities. The excess cost of Dixie and GulfTerra includes amounts attributable to goodwill. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a loss in value of the investment which is other than a temporary decline. For additional information regarding our excess cost amounts, please read Notes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. For Dixie, the amount attributable to goodwill at December 31, 2003 was $9.2 million. For GulfTerra GP, the amount attributable to goodwill at December 31, 2003 was estimated at $328.2 million. The goodwill amount for GulfTerra GP represents our preliminary allocation of the purchase price pending completion of a fair value analysis which is expected to be completed during the second half of 2004. To the extent that our preliminary allocation of the excess cost of GulfTerra GP is ultimately attributed to depreciable or amortizable assets, our equity earnings from GulfTerra will be reduced from what it otherwise would be. The table below shows the potential decrease in equity earnings from GulfTerra GP if certain amounts of the $328.2 million of excess cost preliminarily attributable to goodwill were ultimately assigned to fixed or intangible assets. For purposes of calculating this sensitivity, we have applied the straight-line method of cost allocation (i.e. depreciation or amortization) over an estimated useful life of 20-years to various fair values. Excess Cost attributed to tangible or intangible assets Estimated Annual Reduction in Equity Earnings 20% of excess cost $ 65,643 $ 3,282 40% of excess cost 131,286 6,564 60% of excess cost 196,928 9,846 80% of excess cost 262,571 13,129 100% of excess cost 328,214 16,411 74 Our revenue recognition policies In general, we recognize revenue from our customers when all of the following criteria are met: (i) firm contracts are in place, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) pricing is fixed and determinable and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. When contracts settle (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed), we determine if an allowance is necessary and record it accordingly. Historically, the consolidated revenues we recorded were not materially based on estimates. However, as SEC regulations require us to submit financial information on increasingly accelerated timeframes, our use of estimates will increase. We believe the assumptions underlying any revenue estimates that we might use will not prove to be materially different from actual amounts due to our development and implementation of a fully integrated volume management system that is inclusive of operational activities through financial accounting. For additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies, please read Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Mark-to-market accounting for certain financial instruments Our earnings are also affected by use of the mark-to-market method of accounting for certain financial instruments. We use short-term, highly liquid financial instruments such as swaps, forwards and other contracts to manage price risks associated with inventories, firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions, primarily within our Processing segment. The use of mark-to-market accounting for financial instruments may cause our non-cash earnings to fluctuate based upon changes in underlying indexes, primarily those related to commodity prices. Fair value for the financial instruments we employ is determined using price data from highly liquid markets such as the NYMEX commodity exchange. During 2002, we recognized a loss of $51.3 million from our commodity hedging activities. Of this loss, $5.6 million was attributable to the change in fair value of the portfolio between December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002. In March 2002, the effectiveness of our primary commodity hedging strategy deteriorated due to an unexpected rapid increase in natural gas prices; therefore, the loss in value of our fixed-price natural gas financial instruments was not offset by increased gas processing margins. We exited the strategy underlying this loss in 2002. During 2003, we utilized a limited number of commodity financial instruments from which we recorded a loss of $0.6 million. The fair value of open positions at December 31, 2003 was a nominal receivable amount. For additional information regarding our commodity financial instruments, please read Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. For additional information regarding our use of financial instruments to manage risk and the earnings sensitivity of these instruments to changes in underlying commodity prices, please read the Processing segment discussions under “ – Our results of operations” and also read Item 7A of this annual report. Additional information regarding our financial statements can be found in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Relationship with EPCO and its affiliates We have an extensive and ongoing relationship with EPCO. EPCO is controlled by Dan L. Duncan, who is also a director (and Chairman of the Board of Directors) of our General Partner. In addition, the remaining executive and other officers of our General Partner are employees of EPCO, including O.S. Andras who is our Chief Executive Officer and a director of the General Partner. For a listing of our directors and executive officers, please read Item 10 of this annual report. Mr. Duncan owns 50.4% of the voting stock of EPCO and, accordingly, exercises sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the common units and Class B special units held by EPCO. The remaining shares 75 of EPCO capital stock are held primarily by trusts for the benefit of members of Mr. Duncan’s family. In addition, EPCO and Dan Duncan LLC, together, own 100% of our General Partner, which in turn owns a 2% general partner interest in us. In addition, trust affiliates of EPCO (the 1998 Trust and 2000 Trust) owned 4,478,236 of our common units at February 20, 2004. Collectively, EPCO, Dan L. Duncan, the 1998 Trust and the 2000 Trust owned 54.6% of our partnership interests at February 20, 2004. The principal business activity of the General Partner is to act as our managing partner. We have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement. We reimburse EPCO for the costs associated with employees who work on our behalf. We have entered into an agreement with EPCO to provide trucking services to us for the transportation of NGLs and other products. In addition, we buy from and sell NGL products to EPCO’s Canadian affiliate. During 2003, our related party revenues from EPCO were $4.2 million and our related party expenses with EPCO were $177.6 million. For additional information regarding our relationship with EPCO, please read Item 13 of this annual report. Relationship with Shell We have a significant commercial relationship with Shell as a partner, customer and vendor. At February 20, 2004, Shell owned approximately 18.3% of our partnership interests. Our largest customer is Shell. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Shell accounted for 5.5% of our consolidated revenues. Our revenues from Shell primarily reflect the sale of NGL and petrochemical products to Shell and the fees we charge Shell for pipeline transportation and NGL fractionation services. Our operating costs and expenses with Shell primarily reflect the payment of energy-related expenses related to the Shell natural gas processing agreement and the purchase of NGL products from Shell. During 2003, our related party revenues from Shell were $293.1 million and our related party expenses with Shell were $607.3 million. The most significant contract affecting our natural gas processing business is the Shell margin-band/keepwhole processing agreement, which grants us the right to process Shell’s current and future production within state and federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The Shell processing agreement includes a life of lease dedication, which may extend the agreement well beyond its initial 20-year term ending in 2019. For additional information regarding this contract, please read Item 13 of this annual report. We have completed a number of business acquisitions and asset purchases involving Shell since 1999. Among these transactions were: • the acquisition of TNGL’s natural gas processing and related businesses in 1999 for approximately $528.8 million (this purchase price includes both the $166 million in cash we paid to Shell and the value of the 41,000,000 Class A special units granted to Shell in connection with this acquisition); • the purchase of the Lou-Tex Propylene pipeline for $100 million in 2000; and • the acquisition of Acadian Gas in 2001 for $243.7 million. Shell is also a partner with us in our Gulf of Mexico natural gas pipeline investments. We also lease from Shell its 45.4% interest in our Splitter I propylene fractionation facility. For additional information regarding our relationship with Shell, please read Item 13 of this annual report. OTHER ITEMS Uncertainties regarding our investment in facilities that produce MTBE We have a 66.7% ownership interest in BEF, which owns a facility currently producing MTBE. At December 31, 2003, the value of our underlying equity in BEF was $49.2 million. The production of MTBE is primarily driven by oxygenated fuel programs enacted under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In recent years, MTBE has been detected in water supplies. The major source of ground water contamination appears 76 to be leaks from underground storage tanks. As a result of environmental concerns, several states have enacted legislation to ban or significantly limit the use of MTBE in motor gasoline within their jurisdictions. In addition, federal legislation has been drafted to ban MTBE and replace the oxygenate with renewable fuels such as ethanol. A number of lawsuits have been filed by municipalities and other water suppliers against a number of manufacturers of reformulated gasoline containing MTBE, although generally such suits have not named manufacturers of MTBE as defendants, and there have been no such lawsuits filed against BEF. It is possible, however, that MTBE manufacturers such as BEF could ultimately be added as defendants in such lawsuits or in new lawsuits. While we believe that we currently have adequate insurance to cover any adverse consequences resulting from our production of MTBE, we have been informed by our insurance carrier that upon renewal of our policy in April 2004, MTBE related claims may be excluded from the scope of our insurance coverage. For additional information regarding the impact of environmental regulation on BEF, please read “Business and Properties – Regulation and Environmental Matters – Impact of the Clean Air Act’s oxygenated fuels programs on our BEF investment” included under Items 1 and 2 of this annual report. As a result of these developments, we are currently in the process of modifying the facility to also produce iso-octane, a motor gasoline octane enhancement additive derived from isobutane. We expect iso-octane to be in demand by refiners to replace the amount of octane that is lost as a result of MTBE being eliminated as a motor gasoline blendstock. The modification project is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2004 at a total cost of approximately $30 million. The facility will continue to produce MTBE as market conditions warrant and will be capable of producing either MTBE or iso-octane once the plant modifications are complete. Depending on the outcome of various factors (including pending federal legislation) the facility may be further modified in the future to produce alkylate. Conversion of EPCO Subordinated Units to Common Units On May 1, 2003, 10,704,936 of EPCO’s subordinated units converted to common units as a result of our satisfying certain financial tests. The remaining 21,409,872 subordinated units converted to common units on August 1, 2003. These conversions have no impact upon our earnings per unit or distributions since subordinated units are already included in both the basic and fully diluted earnings per unit calculations and are distribution bearing. Conversion of Shell Special Units to Common Units On August 1, 2003, the last 10,000,000 of Shell’s non-distribution bearing special units converted to common units. The conversion impacted basic earnings per unit beginning in the third quarter of 2003. These units were already included in our fully diluted earnings per unit computations. Since common units are distribution bearing, our limited partner cash distributions to Shell increased beginning with the distribution we made in November 2003. Facility and sensitive infrastructure security matters Following the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, we instituted a review of security measures and practices and emergency response capabilities for all facilities and sensitive infrastructure. In connection with this activity, we have participated in security coordination efforts with law enforcement and public safety authorities, industry mutual-aid groups and regulatory agencies. As a result of these steps, we believe that our security measures, techniques and equipment have been enhanced as appropriate on a location-by-location basis. Further evaluation will be ongoing, with additional measures to be taken as specific governmental alerts, additional information about improving security and new facts come to our attention. 77 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in commodity prices and interest rates. We may use financial instruments (i.e., futures, forwards, swaps, options, and other financial instruments with similar characteristics) to mitigate the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions, primarily within our Processing segment. In general, the types of risks we attempt to hedge are those relating to the variability of future earnings and cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices and interest rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use financial instruments for speculative (or trading) purposes. For additional information regarding our financial instruments, please read Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Commodity price risk The prices of natural gas, NGLs, petrochemical products and MTBE are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage the risks associated with our Processing segment activities, we may enter into various commodity financial instruments. The primary purpose of these risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to price risks associated with natural gas, NGL production and inventories, firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions. The commodity financial instruments we utilize may be settled in cash or with another financial instrument. We do not hedge our exposure related to MTBE price risks. In addition, we generally do not hedge risks associated with the petrochemical marketing activities that are part of our Fractionation segment. In our Pipelines segment, we utilize a limited number of commodity financial instruments to manage the price Acadian Gas charges certain of its customers for natural gas. Lastly, due to the nature of the transactions, we do not employ commodity financial instruments in our fee-based marketing business accounted for in the Other segment. We have adopted a policy to govern our use of commodity financial instruments to manage the risks of our natural gas and NGL businesses. The objective of this policy is to assist us in achieving our profitability goals while maintaining a portfolio with an acceptable level of risk, defined as remaining within the position limits established by our General Partner. We enter into risk management transactions to manage price risk, basis risk, physical risk or other risks related to our commodity positions on both a short-term (less than 30 days) and long-term basis, not to exceed 24 months. The General Partner oversees our strategies associated with physical and financial risks (such as those mentioned previously), approves specific activities subject to the policy (including authorized products, instruments and markets) and establishes specific guidelines and procedures for implementing and ensuring compliance with the policy. Our commodity financial instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the specific guidelines of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” because of ineffectiveness. A financial instrument is generally regarded as “effective” when changes in its fair value almost fully offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item throughout the term of the instrument. Due to the complex nature of risks we attempt to hedge, our commodity financial instruments have generally not qualified as effective hedges under SFAS No. 133, with the result being that changes in the fair value of these positions being recorded on the balance sheet and in earnings through mark-to-market accounting. Mark-to-market accounting results in a degree of non-cash earnings volatility that is dependent upon changes in the commodity prices underlying these financial instruments. Even though these financial instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, we view such contracts as hedges since this was the intent when we entered into such positions. Upon entering into such positions, our expectation is that the economic performance of these instruments will mitigate (or offset) the commodity risk being addressed. The specific accounting for these contracts, however, is consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 133. We assess the risk of our commodity financial instrument portfolio using a sensitivity analysis model. The sensitivity analysis performed on this portfolio measures the potential income or loss (e.g., the change in fair value of the portfolio) based upon a hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying quoted market prices of the commodity financial instruments outstanding at the dates noted within the following table. In general, the quoted market prices used in the model are from those actively quoted on commodity exchanges (i.e., NYMEX) for instruments of similar 78 duration. In those rare instances where prices are not actively quoted, we employ regression analysis techniques possessing strong correlation factors. The sensitivity analysis model takes into account the following primary factors and assumptions: • the current quoted market price of natural gas; • the current quoted market price of NGLs; • changes in the composition of commodities hedged (i.e., the mix between natural gas and related NGLs); fluctuations in the overall volume of commodities hedged (for both natural gas and related NGL hedges outstanding); • market interest rates, which are used in determining the present value; and • a liquid market for such financial instruments. An increase in fair value of the commodity financial instruments (based upon the factors and assumptions noted above) approximates the income that would be recognized if all of the commodity financial instruments were settled at the dates noted within the table. Conversely, a decrease in fair value of the commodity financial instruments would result in the recording of a loss. The sensitivity analysis model does not include the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged commodity positions to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of the commodity financial instruments of a change in commodity prices would be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged commodity positions, assuming: • the commodity financial instruments function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk; • the commodity financial instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term; and • as applicable, anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected. We routinely review our outstanding financial instruments in light of current market conditions. If market conditions warrant, some financial instruments may be closed out in advance of their contractual settlement dates thus realizing income or loss depending on the specific exposure. When this occurs, we may enter into a new commodity financial instrument to reestablish the economic hedge to which the closed instrument relates. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the fair value (“FV”) of our commodity financial instrument portfolio and the related potential impact on our earnings (“IE”) at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands): Scenario Resulting classification At 12/31/02 At 12/31/03 At 02/20/04 FV assuming no change in quoted market prices Asset (Liability) $ (26) $ 4 $ 2 FV assuming 10% increase in quoted market prices Asset (Liability) $ (26) $ 4 $ 2 IE assuming 10% increase in quoted market prices Income (Loss) $ - $ - $ - FV assuming 10% decrease in quoted market prices Asset (Liability) $ (26) $ 4 $ 2 IE assuming 10% decrease in quoted market prices Income (Loss) $ - $ - $ - During 2003, we recognized a loss of $0.6 million from our commodity hedging activities that was recorded as an increase in our operating costs and expenses in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. Of the loss recognized in 2003, $0.8 million is related to commodity hedging activities associated with natural gas purchases within the Pipeline segment offset by a $0.2 million gain from commodity hedging activities associated with the hedging of NGL production within the Processing segment. During 2002, we recognized a loss of $51.3 million from our commodity hedging activities that was recorded as an increase in our operating costs and expenses in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. Of the loss recognized in 2002, $5.6 million was related to non-cash mark-to-market income recorded on open positions at 79 December 31, 2001. Due to commodity hedging losses we incurred during the first quarter of 2002, we exited most of our positions. For additional information regarding our Processing segment’s results for 2002, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our results of operations — Year ended December 31, 2003 compared to year ended December 31, 2002” included under Item 7 of this annual report. At end of 2003 and 2002, we had a limited number of commodity financial instruments outstanding. The fair value of the portfolio at February 20, 2004 was a nominal asset amount and was again comprised of a limited number of positions. Product purchase commitments. We have long and short-term purchase commitments for NGLs, petrochemicals and natural gas with several suppliers. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. For additional information regarding these commitments, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Contractual Obligations” included under Item 7 of this annual report. Interest rate risk Our interest rate exposure results from variable-interest rate borrowings and fixed-interest rate borrowings. We assess the cash flow risk related to interest rates by identifying and measuring changes in our interest rate exposures that may impact future cash flows and evaluating hedging opportunities to manage these risks. We use analytical techniques to measure our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, including cash flow sensitivity analysis to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows. The General Partner oversees the strategies associated with these financial risks and approves instruments that are appropriate for our requirements. Interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2002, we had one interest rate swap outstanding having a notional amount of $54 million that was terminated on March 1, 2003 at the election of the counterparty. Upon the termination, we received $1.6 million associated with the final settlement of this swap. The fair value of this swap at December 31, 2002 was $1.6 million. There was no earnings impact from the termination of this swap. On January 8, 2004, we entered into three interest rate swaps under which we agreed to pay variable rates of interest to mitigate the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt as shown below: Hedged Fixed-Rate Debt Effective Date Termination Date Notional Amount Senior Notes D, 7.50% fixed-rate 1/12/04 2/01/2011 $50 Million Senior Notes C, 6.375% fixed-rate 1/12/04 2/01/2013 $100 Million Senior Notes C, 6.375% fixed-rate 1/12/04 2/01/2013 $100 Million We have designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The swap agreements have a combine notional amount of $250 million and match the maturity of the underlying debt being hedged. Under the swap agreements, we pay to the counterparty a floating LIBOR-based interest rate (plus an applicable margin) and receive back from the counterparty a fixed-rate payment equivalent to rate being charged us under the debt being hedged, all based on the notional amounts stated in each swap agreement. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the fair value (“FV”) of our interest rate swap portfolio and potential change in the fair value of the debt. Income is not affected by changes in the fair value of the swap. However, the swap effectively converted the hedged portion of the fixed rate debt to a floating rate debt. Therefore, interest expense (and related cash flow) will increase or decrease with the change in the periodic “reset” rate associated with the respective interest rate swaps. The reset rate is the agreed upon index rate published for the first day of the six-month interest calculation period. Scenario Resulting Classification At 2/20/04 Change in Fair Value of Debt FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) $ 978 $ - FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) $(7,831) $(8,809) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) $ 9,787 $ 8,809 80 Treasury Locks. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we entered into seven treasury lock transactions with original maturities of either January 31, 2003 or April 15, 2003. A treasury lock is a specialized agreement that fixes the price (or yield) on a specific U.S. treasury security for an established period of time. The purpose of these transactions was to hedge the underlying treasury interest rate associated with our anticipated issuance of debt in early 2003 to partially refinance the Mid-America and Seminole acquisitions. Our treasury lock transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. The notional amounts of these transactions totaled $550 million, with a total treasury lock rate of approximately 4%. We elected to settle all of the treasury locks in early February 2003 in connection with our issuance of Senior Notes C and D. For additional information regarding Senior Notes C and D, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our liquidity and capital resource—Our debt obligations” included under Item 7 of this annual report. The settlement of the treasury locks resulted in our receipt of $5.4 million of cash. The $5.4 million is being amortized into income as a reduction of interest expense over a 10-year period. The amortization period is based on the terms of the anticipated transaction as required by SFAS No. 133. The fair value of these instruments at December 31, 2002 was a current liability of $3.8 million offset by a current asset of $0.2 million. The $3.6 million net liability was recorded as a component of comprehensive income on that date, with no impact to current earnings. With the settlement of the treasury locks, the $3.6 million net liability was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in Partners’ Equity to offset the current asset and liabilities we recorded at December 31, 2002, with no impact to earnings. For additional information regarding our treasury lock transactions, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report.",2023-12-30 21:15:57.731827

Overview of Business We are a North American midstream energy company providing a wide range of services to producers and consumers of natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”), crude oil and certain petrochemicals. In addition, we are an industry leader in the development of pipeline and other midstream energy infrastructure in the continental United States and Gulf of Mexico. We are a publicly traded Delaware 56 Table of Contents limited partnership formed in 1998, the common units of which are listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “EPD.” Our midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the United States, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. We have four reportable business segments: NGL Pipelines & Services; Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services; Offshore Pipelines & Services; and Petrochemical Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the type of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO. We are owned 98.0% by our limited partners and 2.0% by our general partner, EPGP. EPGP is owned 100.0% by Enterprise GP Holdings. General Outlook for 2009 The current global recession and financial crisis have impacted energy companies generally. The recession and related slowdown in economic activity has reduced demand for energy and related products, which in turn has generally led to significant decreases in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. The financial crisis has resulted in the effective insolvency, liquidation or government intervention for a number of financial institutions, investment companies, hedge funds and highly leveraged industrial companies. This has had an adverse impact on the prices of debt and equity securities that has generally increased the cost and limited the availability of debt and equity capital. Commercial Outlook In 2008, there was significant volatility in the prices of refined products, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. For example, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil ranged from a high near $147 per barrel in mid-2008 to $35 per barrel in January 2009; while the price of natural gas at the Henry Hub ranged from a high of over $13.00 per MMBtu in mid-2008 to $5.00 per MMBtu in January 2009. On a composite basis, the average price of NGLs declined from $1.68 per gallon for the third quarter of 2008 to $0.74 per gallon for the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in energy commodity prices combined with higher costs of capital have led many crude oil and natural gas producers to reconsider their drilling budgets for 2009. As a midstream energy company, we provide services for producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and certain petrochemicals. The products that we process, sell or transport are principally used as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating; feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing; and in the production of motor gasoline. The decrease in energy commodity prices has caused many oil and natural gas producers, which include many of our customers, to reduce their drilling budgets in 2009. This has resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of drilling rigs operating in the United States as surveyed by Baker Hughes Incorporated. The U.S. operating rig count decreased from a peak of 2,031 rigs in September 2008 to approximately 1,300 in February 2009. We expect oil and gas producers in our operating areas to reduce their drilling activity to varying degrees, which may lead to lower crude oil, natural gas and NGL production growth in the near term and, as a result, lower transportation, processing and marketing volumes for us than would have otherwise been the case. In our natural gas processing business, we hedged approximately 80% of our equity NGL production margins for 2008 to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these volumes. We have hedged approximately 67% of our expected equity NGL production margins for 2009. Since the hedges were consummated at prices that are significantly higher than current levels, we are expected to be partially insulated from lower natural gas processing margins in 2009. The recession has reduced demand for midstream energy services and products by industrial customers. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the petrochemical industry experienced a dramatic destocking of inventories, which reduced demand for purity NGL products such as ethane, propane and normal butane. We expect that petrochemical demand will strengthen in early 2009 and have starting seeing signs of such 57 Table of Contents demand through February 2009 as petrochemical customers have begun to restock their depleted inventories. This trend is also evidenced by slightly higher operating rates of U.S. ethylene crackers, which averaged approximately 70% of capacity in February 2009 as compared to 56% in December 2008. Four additional ethylene crackers were expected to recommence operations in February 2009. The average utilization rate for ethylene crackers in 2008 was approximately 80%. Based on currently available information, we expect that the operating rates of U.S. ethylene crackers will approximate 80% of capacity in 2009. We expect that crude oil prices will rebound from recent lows in the second half of 2009. As a result, we believe the petrochemical industry will continue to prefer NGL feedstocks over crude-based alternatives such as naphtha. In general, when the price of crude oil rises relative to that of natural gas, NGLs become more attractive as a source of feedstocks for the petrochemical industry. The reduction in near-term demand for crude oil and NGLs has created a contango market (i.e., a market in which the price of a commodity is higher in future months than the current spot price) for these products, which, in turn, we are benefiting from through an increase in revenues earned by our storage assets in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Liquidity Outlook Debt and equity capital markets have also experienced significant recent volatility. The major U.S. and international equity market indices experienced significant losses in 2008, including losses of approximately 38% and 34% for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, respectively. Likewise, the Alerian MLP Index, which is a recognized major index for publicly traded partnerships, lost approximately 42% of its value. The contraction in credit available to and investor redemptions of holdings in certain investment companies and hedge funds exacerbated the selling pressure and volatility in both the debt and equity capital markets. This has resulted in a higher cost of debt and equity capital for the public and private sector. Near term demand for equity securities through follow on offerings, including our common units, may be reduced due to the recent problems encountered by investment companies and hedge funds, both of which significantly participated in equity offerings over the past few years. While the cost of capital has increased, we have demonstrated our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets during this distressed period. In December 2008, we issued $500.0 million of 9.75% senior notes. The higher cost of capital is evident when you compare the interest rate of the December 2008 senior notes offering to the $400.0 million of 5.65% senior notes that we issued in March 2008. On a positive note, our indicative cost of long-term borrowing has improved approximately 250 basis points in early 2009 in conjunction with the recent improvement in the debt capital markets. We believe that we will be able to either access the capital markets or utilize availability under our long-term multi-year revolving credit facility to refinance our $717.6 million of debt obligations that mature in 2009. In January 2009, we issued approximately 10.6 million of our common units at an effective annual distribution yield of 9.5%. Net offering proceeds of $225.6 million were used to reduce borrowings and for general partnership purposes. The increase in the cost of capital has caused us to prioritize our respective internal growth projects to select those with higher rates of return. However, consistent with our business strategies, we continuously evaluate possible acquisitions of assets that would complement our current operations. Given the current state of the credit markets, we believe competition for such assets has decreased, which may result in opportunities for us to acquire assets at attractive prices that would be accretive to our partners and expand our portfolio of midstream energy assets. Based on information currently available, we estimate that our capital spending for property, plant and equipment in 2009 will approximate $1.00 billion, which includes $820.0 million for growth capital projects and $180.0 million for sustaining capital expenditures. The 2009 forecast amounts for growth capital projects include amounts that are expected to be spent on the Texas Offshore Port System. See “Recent Developments – Texas Offshore Port System” for additional information regarding this joint venture. 58 Table of Contents We expect four of our significant construction projects to be completed and the assets placed into service during the first half of 2009. These projects include (i) the expansion of the Meeker natural gas processing plant, which began operations in February 2009, (ii) the Exxon Mobil central treating facility, (iii) the Sherman Extension natural gas pipeline, and (iv) the Shenzi Crude Oil Pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico. Substantially all of the financing to fund these projects has been completed. In 2009, we expect these projects to contribute significant new sources of revenue, operating income and cash flow from operations. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike damaged a number of energy-related assets onshore and offshore along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast in the summer of 2008, including certain of our offshore pipelines and platforms. Repairs are being completed on our affected assets and they are expected to be ready to return to service once third party production fields return to operational status over the course of 2009. A few of our customers have experienced severe financial problems leading to a significant impact on their creditworthiness. These financial problems are rooted in various factors including the significant use of debt, current financial crises, economic recession and changes in commodity prices. We are working to implement, to the extent allowable under applicable contracts, tariffs and regulations, prepayments and other security requirements, such as letters of credit, to enhance our respective credit position relating to amounts owed to us by certain customers. We cannot provide assurance that one or more of our customers will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows; however, we believe that we have provided adequate allowances for such customers. We expect our proactive approach to funding capital spending and other partnership needs, combined with sufficient trade credit to operate our businesses efficiently, and available borrowing capacity under their credit facilities, to provide us with a foundation to meet our anticipated liquidity and capital requirements in 2009. We also believe that we will be able to access the capital markets in 2009 to maintain financial flexibility. Based on information currently available to us, we believe that we will maintain our investment grade credit ratings and meet our loan covenant obligations in 2009. Recent Developments The following information highlights our significant developments since January 1, 2008 through the date of this filing. Enterprise Products Partners Issues $225.6 million of Common Units In January 2009, Enterprise Products Partners sold 10,590,000 common units representing limited partner interests (including an over-allotment of 990,000 common units) to the public at an offering price of $22.20 per unit. Net offering proceeds of $225.6 million were used to reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and for general partnership purposes. High Island Offshore System Natural Gas Pipeline Resumes Operations In December 2008, repairs were completed on the High Island Offshore System (“HIOS”) pipeline that was severed in September 2008 during Hurricane Ike. Federal regulators, after approving our inspection and start-up procedures, authorized the partnership to resume full service on HIOS. The pipeline has the capacity to transport up to 1.8 Bcf/d of natural gas. Operations Begin at White River Hub In December 2008, we and Questar Pipeline Company (“Questar”), a subsidiary of Questar Corp., announced that service had begun on the White River Hub. Located in Rio Blanco County, Colo., the White River Hub currently connects our natural-gas processing plant at Meeker with four interstate natural gas pipelines: Rockies Express Pipeline LLC; Questar; Northwest Pipeline GP (including the Williams Willow Creek processing plant, which is currently under construction); and TransColorado Gas 59 Table of Contents Transmission Company. Two more interstate pipelines, the Wyoming Interstate Company and Colorado Interstate Gas systems, are expected to be connected during the first quarter of 2009. Sale of Interest in Companies to Duncan Energy Partners In December 2008, Duncan Energy Partners acquired controlling equity interests in three midstream energy companies from affiliates of EPO in a transaction valued at $730.0 million. Duncan Energy Partners acquired a 51.0% membership interest in Enterprise Texas Pipeline LLC (“Enterprise Texas”); a 51.0% general partnership interest in Enterprise Intrastate LP (“Enterprise Intrastate”); and a 66.0% general partnership interest in Enterprise GC, LP (“Enterprise GC”). In the aggregate, these companies own more than 8,000 miles of natural gas pipelines with 5.6 Bcf/d of capacity; a leased natural gas storage facility with 6.8 Bcf of storage capacity; more than 1,000 miles of NGL pipelines; approximately 18 MMBbls of leased NGL storage capacity; and two NGL fractionators with a combined fractionation capacity of 87 MBPD. All of these assets are located in Texas. As consideration for this dropdown transaction, EPO received 37,333,887 Class B units valued at $449.5 million and $280.5 million in cash from Duncan Energy Partners. The Class B limited partner units automatically converted to common units of Duncan Energy Partners on February 1, 2009. For additional information regarding this transaction, see “Other Items – Duncan Energy Partners Transactions” within this Item 7 EPO Issues $500.0 Million of Senior Notes In December 2008, EPO sold $500.0 million in principal amount of 9.75% fixed-rate, unsecured senior notes due January 2014 (“Senior Notes O”). Net proceeds from this offering were used to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and for general partnership purposes. For additional information regarding this issuance of debt, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. EPO Executes $592.6 Million of Credit Facilities In November 2008, EPO executed two senior unsecured credit facilities that provide the partnership with $592.6 million of incremental borrowing capacity. The facilities are comprised of a $375.0 million credit facility maturing in November 2009 and a 20.7 billion yen (approximately $217.6 million U.S. dollar equivalent) term loan maturing in March 2009. The Japanese term loan has a funded cost of approximately 4.93%, including the cost of related foreign exchange currency swaps. For additional information regarding these issuances of debt, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Texas Offshore Port System In August 2008, we, together with TEPPCO and Oiltanking Holding Americas, Inc. (“Oiltanking”), announced the formation of the Texas Offshore Port System, a joint venture to design, construct, operate and own a Texas offshore crude oil port and a related onshore pipeline and storage system that would facilitate delivery of waterborne crude oil to refining centers located along the upper Texas Gulf Coast. Demand for such projects is being driven by planned and expected refinery expansions along the Gulf Coast, expected increases in shipping traffic and operating limitations of regional ship channels. The joint venture’s primary project, referred to as “TOPS,” includes (i) an offshore port (which will be located approximately 36 miles from Freeport, Texas), (ii) an onshore storage facility with approximately 3.9 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity, and (iii) an 85-mile crude oil pipeline system having a transportation capacity of up to 1.8 million barrels per day, that will extend from the offshore port to a storage facility near Texas City, Texas. The joint venture’s complementary project, referred to as the Port Arthur Crude Oil Express (or “PACE”) will transport crude oil from Texas City, including crude oil from TOPS, and will consist of a 75-mile pipeline and 1.2 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity in the Port Arthur, Texas area. Development of the TOPS and PACE projects is supported by long-term contracts with affiliates of Motiva Enterprises LLC (“Motiva”) and Exxon Mobil Corporation 60 Table of Contents (“Exxon Mobil”), which have committed a combined 725 MBPD of crude oil to the projects. The timing of the construction and related capital costs of the TOPS and PACE projects will be affected by the acquisition of requisite permits. We, TEPPCO and Oiltanking each own, through our respective subsidiaries, a one-third interest in the joint venture. The aggregate cost of the TOPS and PACE projects is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion (excluding capitalized interest), with the majority of such capital expenditures currently expected to occur in 2010 and 2011. We and TEPPCO have each guaranteed up to approximately $700.0 million, which includes a contingency amount for potential cost overruns, of the capital contribution obligations of our respective subsidiary partners in the joint venture. As of December 31, 2008, our investment in the Texas Offshore Port System was $35.9 million. Acquisition of Remaining Interest in Dixie In August 2008, we acquired the remaining 25.8% ownership interest in Dixie Pipeline Company (“Dixie”) for $57.1 million. As a result of this transaction, we own 100.0% of Dixie, which owns a 1,371-mile pipeline system that delivers NGLs (primarily propane) to customers along the U.S. Gulf Coast and southeastern United States. Reorganization of Commercial Management Team In July 2008, Mr. A. J. Teague, Executive Vice President, was elected as a Director to the Boards of both our general partner and that of Duncan Energy Partners and as Chief Commercial Officer responsible for managing all of the commercial activities of the two partnerships. In connection with Mr. Teague’s appointment as Chief Commercial Officer, certain members of our senior management team were realigned to report to Mr. Teague. Mr. Teague will continue to report to Michael A. Creel, President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of Enterprise Products Partners. Independence Trail and Hub Resume Operations In April 2008, production at the Independence Hub natural gas platform was shut-in due to a leak in the flex-joint assembly where the Independence Trail export pipeline connects to the platform. In July 2008, repairs were completed and the Independence Hub platform and Trail pipeline returned to operation. Our Independence Trail export pipeline recorded $17.0 million of expense associated with the flex-joint repairs. We have submitted a claim with our insurance carriers regarding the flex-joint repair costs. To the extent that we receive cash proceeds from this claim in the future, such amounts would be recorded as income in the period of receipt. EPO Issues $1.10 Billion of Senior Notes In April 2008, EPO sold $400.0 million in principal amount of 5.65% fixed-rate, unsecured senior notes due April 2013 (“Senior Notes M”) and $700.0 million in principal amount of 6.50% fixed-rate, unsecured senior notes due January 2019 (“Senior Notes N”). Net proceeds from this offering were used to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. For additional information regarding this issuance of debt, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Duncan Energy Partners’ Shelf Registration Statement In March 2008, Duncan Energy Partners filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC that authorized its issuance of up to $1.00 billion in debt and equity securities. As of February 2, 2008, Duncan Energy Partners has issued $0.5 million in equity securities under this registration statement. 61 Table of Contents Pioneer Cryogenic Natural Gas Processing Facility Commences Operations In February 2008, we commenced operations of the Pioneer cryogenic natural gas processing facility. Located near the Opal Hub in southwestern Wyoming, this new facility is designed to process up to 700 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract as much as 30 MBPD of NGLs. We intend to maintain the operational capability of our Pioneer silica gel natural gas processing plant, which is located adjacent to the Pioneer cryogenic plant, as a back-up to provide producers with additional assurance of our processing capability at the complex. NGLs extracted at our Pioneer complex are transported on our Mid-America Pipeline System and ultimately to our Hobbs and Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators. In late March 2008, operations at our Pioneer cryogenic natural gas processing facility were temporarily suspended following a release of natural gas and subsequent fire. No injuries resulted from the incident, which was restricted to a small area within the plant. The facility resumed operations in April 2008. Results of Operations We have four reportable business segments: NGL Pipelines & Services, Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, Offshore Pipelines & Services and Petrochemical Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the type of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. Our non-GAAP financial measure of total segment gross operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP operating income. We define total segment gross operating margin as consolidated operating income before (i) depreciation, amortization and accretion expense; (ii) operating lease expenses for which we do not have the payment obligation; (iii) gains and losses from asset sales and related transactions; and (iv) general and administrative costs. Gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, provision for income taxes, minority interest, extraordinary charges and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses (net of the adjustments noted above) from segment revenues, with both segment totals before the elimination of intersegment and intrasegment transactions. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. We include equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin and operating income. Our equity investments with industry partners are a vital component of our business strategy. They are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with those of our customers and/or suppliers. This method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand alone basis. Many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations. Our consolidated gross operating margin amounts include the gross operating margin amounts of Duncan Energy Partners on a 100.0% basis. Volumetric data associated with the operations of Duncan Energy Partners are also included on a 100.0% basis in our consolidated statistical data. For additional information regarding our business segments, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 62 Table of Contents Selected Price and Volumetric Data The following table illustrates selected annual and quarterly industry index prices for natural gas, crude oil and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods presented.

During 2008, our largest customer was LyondellBasell Industries (“LBI”) and its affiliates, which accounted for 9.6% of our consolidated revenues. In 2007 and 2006, our largest customer was The Dow Chemical Company and its affiliates, which accounted for 6.9% and 6.1%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. On January 6, 2009, LBI announced that its U.S. operations had voluntarily filed to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, we had approximately $17.3 million of credit exposure to LBI, which was reduced to approximately $10.0 million through remedies provided under certain pipeline tariffs. In addition, we are seeking to have LBI accept certain contracts and have filed claims pursuant to current Bankruptcy Court Orders that we expect will allow us to recover the majority of the remaining credit exposure. For 2008, LBI accounted for 10.2%, or $1.6 billion, of revenues attributable to our NGL Pipelines & Services business segment and 19.2%, or $516.2 million, of revenues attributable to our Petrochemical Services business segment. Comparison of 2008 with 2007 Revenues for 2008 were $21.91 billion compared to $16.95 billion for 2007. The $4.96 billion year-to-year increase in consolidated revenues is primarily due to higher energy commodity sales volumes and prices during 2008 relative to 2007. These factors accounted for $5.01 billion of the year-to-year increase in consolidated revenues associated with our NGL, natural gas and petrochemical marketing activities. Equity NGLs we produced at our newly constructed Meeker and Pioneer natural gas plants and sold in connection with our NGL marketing activities contributed $731.3 million of the year-to-year increase in marketing activity revenues. Operating costs and expenses were $20.46 billion for 2008 versus $16.01 billion for 2007. The $4.45 billion year-to-year increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses is primarily due to higher cost of sales associated with our marketing activities. The cost of sales of our marketing activities increased $3.57 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher energy commodity sales volumes and prices. Likewise, the operating costs and expenses of our natural gas processing plants increased $306.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher energy commodity prices. Consolidated operating costs and expenses attributable to newly constructed assets we placed into service after January 1, 2007 increased $414.3 million year-to-year. General and administrative costs increased $2.9 million year-to-year. Changes in our revenues and costs and expenses year-to-year are explained in part by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $1.40 per gallon during 2008 versus $1.19 per gallon during 2007. Our determination of the weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs is based on U.S. Gulf Coast prices for such products at Mont Belvieu, Texas, which is the primary industry hub for domestic NGL production. The market price of natural gas (as measured at Henry Hub) averaged $9.04 per MMBtu during 2008 versus $6.86 per MMBtu during 2007. See “Results of Operations - Selected Price and Volumetric Data” within this Item 7 for additional historical energy commodity pricing information. Equity in earnings from our unconsolidated affiliates was $59.1 million for 2008 compared to $29.7 million for 2007, a $29.4 million year-to-year increase. Equity in earnings from our investment in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (“Cameron Highway”) increased $27.6 million year-to-year due to higher transportation volumes and lower interest expense. On a 100.0% basis, Cameron Highway had crude oil transportation volumes of 161 MBPD during 2008 compared to 88 MBPD during 2007. Equity in earnings from our investment in Jonah Gas Gathering Company (“Jonah”) increased $12.1 million year-to-year. We earned a fixed 19.4% interest in Jonah during the third quarter of 2007 upon completion of certain achievements with respect to the Phase V Expansion of the Jonah Gathering System. Equity in earnings from our investment in Nemo Gathering Company, LLC (“Nemo”) increased $5.0 million year-to-year due to the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2007. Collectively, equity earnings from our other investments decreased $15.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher 65 Table of Contents repair and maintenance expenses during 2008 relative to 2007 as well as the effects of downtime and reduced volumes attributable to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Operating income for 2008 was $1.41 billion compared to $883.0 million for 2007. Collectively, the aforementioned changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity earnings contributed to the $530.2 million increase in operating income year-to-year. Interest expense increased to $400.7 million for 2008 from $311.8 million for 2007. The $88.9 million year-to-year increase in interest expense is primarily due to our issuance of Senior Notes M and N in the second quarter of 2008 and Senior Notes L in the third quarter of 2007. Average debt principal outstanding during 2008 was $7.93 billion compared to $6.18 billion during 2007. Provision for income taxes increased $11.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher expenses associated with the Texas Margin Tax. The increase in expenses for the Texas Margin Tax primarily reflects a higher taxable margin in the State of Texas during 2008 relative to 2007. In addition we recognized a $4.4 million benefit with respect to the Texas Margin Tax during 2007 due to the reorganization of certain of our entities from partnerships to limited liability companies. Minority interest expense increased $10.7 million year-to-year attributable to the public unitholders of Duncan Energy Partners and third-party ownership interests in the Independence Hub platform. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, our consolidated net income increased $420.3 million year-to-year to $954.0 million for 2008 compared to $533.7 million for 2007. In general, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike had an adverse effect across our operations in the Gulf of Mexico and along the U.S. Gulf Coast during 2008. Storm-related disruptions in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production in these regions resulted in reduced volumes available to our pipeline systems, natural gas processing plants, NGL fractionators and offshore platforms, which in turn caused a decrease in gross operating margin for certain operations. In addition, property damage caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike resulted in lower revenues due to facility downtime as well as higher operating costs and expenses at certain of our plants and pipelines. As a result of our allocated share of EPCO’s insurance deductibles for windstorm coverage, gross operating margin for 2008 includes $47.9 million of repair expenses for property damage sustained by our assets as a result of the hurricanes. We estimate that gross operating margin was reduced by $77.0 million during 2008 due to the effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike as a result of supply interruptions and facility downtime. For more information regarding our insurance program and claims related to these storms, see “Other Items – Insurance Matters” included within this Item 7. The following information highlights significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $1.29 billion for 2008 compared to $812.5 million for 2007. The $478.0 million year-to-year increase in segment gross operating margin is due to strong natural gas processing margins and petrochemical demand for NGLs as well as an increase in equity NGL production attributable to our Meeker and Pioneer natural gas processing facilities. Results for 2007 include $32.7 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims compared to $1.1 million for 2008. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding proceeds from business interruption insurance claims. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business was $815.3 million for 2008 compared to $389.1 million for 2007. Equity NGL production increased to 108 MBPD during 2008 from 88 MBPD during 2007. The $426.2 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is largely due to contributions from our Meeker and Pioneer cryogenic natural gas processing facilities, which commenced commercial operations during October 2007 and February 2008, respectively. These facilities contributed $274.5 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin and produced 49 MBPD of equity NGLs during 2008 compared to 23 MBPD during 2007. 66 Table of Contents Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of this business increased $151.7 million year-to-year primarily due improved results from our NGL marketing activities attributable to higher NGL sales margins and volumes in 2008 relative to 2007. Results for 2008 include $6.8 million of hurricane-related property damage repair expenses associated with our natural gas processing plants in southern Louisiana. Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage business was $369.2 million for 2008 compared to $302.2 million for 2007. Total NGL transportation volumes increased to 1,819 MBPD during 2008 from 1,666 MBPD during 2007. The $67.0 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin from this business is primarily due to improved results from our Mid-America and Seminole Pipeline Systems and our Mont Belvieu storage complex. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America and Seminole Pipeline Systems increased $43.6 million year-to-year due to higher transportation volumes and an increase in the system-wide tariff. These pipeline systems contributed 116 MBPD of the year-to-year increase in NGL transportation volumes. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu storage complex increased $15.5 million as a result of higher storage revenues during 2008 relative to 2007. Gross operating margin from the remainder of our NGL pipeline and storage assets increased $7.9 million year-to-year attributable to (i) higher transportation volumes on our Dixie Pipeline System and our Lou-Tex NGL Pipeline and (ii) lower maintenance and pipeline integrity expenses on our Dixie Pipeline and South Louisiana Pipeline System. In general the improved results from our NGL pipeline and storage assets were partially offset by downtime and reduced volumes as a result of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike during 2008. Results for 2008 include $0.9 million of hurricane-related property damage repair expenses. Gross operating margin from our NGL fractionation business was $104.8 million for 2008 compared to $88.4 million for 2007. Fractionation volumes increased from 394 MBPD during 2007 to 429 MBPD during 2008. Gross operating margin from our Hobbs fractionator increased $26.7 million year-to-year. Our Hobbs fractionator was placed into service during August 2007 and contributed a 41 MBPD year-to-year increase in NGL fractionation volumes. Collectively, gross operating margin from our other NGL fractionators decreased $10.3 million year-to-year primarily due to downtime and lower volumes at our Norco, South Texas and Baton Rouge fractionators and a combined $0.9 million of hurricane-related property damage repair expenses in 2008. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $411.3 million for 2008 compared to $335.7 million for 2007, a $75.6 million year-to-year increase. Our onshore natural gas transportation volumes were 7,477 BBtus/d during 2008 compared to 6,632 BBtus/d during 2007. Gross operating margin from our onshore natural gas pipeline and related natural gas marketing business increased $64.7 million year-to-year to $371.9 million for 2008 from $307.2 million for 2007. Collectively, gross operating margin from our natural gas pipelines increased $75.1 million year-to-year primarily due to (i) higher revenues from our San Juan Gathering System, (ii) higher transportation activity on our Texas Intrastate System, (iii) higher natural gas sales margins on our Acadian Gas System and (iv) increased equity earnings from our investment in Jonah. Results for 2008 include $1.3 million of hurricane-related property damage repair expenses attributable to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities decreased $10.4 million year-to-year primarily due to non-cash mark-to-market related charges that are expected to be recouped in cash in future periods extending through 2009. Our natural gas marketing business increased significantly during 2008. These marketing activities have four primary objectives: (i) to mitigate risk; (ii) maximize the use of our natural gas assets; (iii) to provide real-time market intelligence; and (iv) to link our noncontiguous natural gas assets together to enhance the profitability of such operations. To achieve these objectives, our natural gas marketing activities transact with various parties to provide transportation, balancing, storage, supply and sales services. The majority of our natural gas marketing activities are focused on the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions. Our natural gas marketing business acquires a significant portion of the natural gas it sells from our processing plants and additional supplies from third parties at pipeline interconnects to facilitate 67 Table of Contents incremental throughput on our natural gas transportation pipelines. This purchased gas is then sold to industrial consumers, utilities and power plants at prices that include a transportation fee. In addition, sales are made to third party marketing companies at industry hub locations in order to balance our supply/demand portfolio. Our purchase and sale transactions are typically based on published daily or monthly index prices. We utilize financial instruments to hedge various transactions within our natural gas marketing business. We use third party transportation and storage capacity to link together our non-contiguous natural gas assets. Our natural gas marketing business contracts with third party transportation and storage providers to provide services on both a firm and interruptible basis. This strategy allows us to complement and strengthen our portfolio of natural gas assets. Gross operating margin from our natural gas storage business was $39.4 million for 2008 compared to $28.4 million for 2007. The $11.0 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to increased storage activity at our Petal natural gas storage facility and improved results at our Wilson facility. We placed additional natural gas storage caverns in operation during the third quarters of 2007 and 2008 at our Petal facility, which provided an additional 1.6 Bcf and 4.2 Bcf of subscribed capacity, respectively. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $188.1 million for 2008 compared to $171.6 million for 2007. The $16.5 million year-to-year increase in segment gross operating margin is primarily due to contributions from our Independence Hub and Trail project and improved results from our Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline. Results from this business segment for 2008 were negatively impacted by (i) downtime and $17.0 million of repair expenses associated with a leak on the Independence Trail pipeline and (ii) the effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike including downtime, reduced volumes and $37.2 million of property damage repair expenses. Results for 2008 include $0.2 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims compared to $3.4 million of proceeds during 2007. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding proceeds from business interruption insurance. Gross operating margin from our offshore platform services business was $144.8 million for 2008 compared to $111.7 million for 2007, a $33.1 million year-to-year increase. Our Independence Hub platform, which was completed in March 2007, provided a $49.5 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin. Gross operating margin increased year-to-year despite the platform being shut-in for 66 days during the second quarter of 2008 due to a leak on the Independence Trail export pipeline. While the Independence Hub platform did not earn volumetric fees during the period of suspended operations, the platform continued to earn its fixed demand revenues of approximately $4.6 million per month. Gross operating margin from the remainder of this business decreased $16.4 million year-to-year primarily due to the effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and upstream supply disruptions. Results for our offshore platform services business include $5.0 million of hurricane-related property damage repair expenses in 2008. Our net platform natural gas processing volumes increased to 632 MMcf/d during 2008 compared to 494 MMcf/d during 2007. Gross operating margin from our offshore crude oil pipeline business was $36.2 million for 2008 versus $21.1 million for 2007, a $15.1 million year-to-year increase. Gross operating margin increased $27.6 million year-to-year due to increased equity in earnings from Cameron Highway, which benefited from higher crude oil transportation volumes and lower interest expense in 2008 relative to 2007. Net to our ownership interest, crude oil transportation volumes on the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System were 80 MBPD in 2008 compared to 44 MBPD in 2007. Gross operating margin from the remainder of this business decreased $12.5 million year-to-year due to the effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, which include (i) downtime resulting from damage sustained by our pipelines as well as downstream assets owned by third-party and (ii) reduced volumes available to our pipelines as a result of upstream supply disruptions. Results for our offshore crude oil pipeline business include $2.3 million of hurricane-related property damage repair expenses in 2008. Total offshore crude oil transportation volumes were 169 MBPD during 2008 versus 163 MBPD during 2007. 68 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our offshore natural gas pipeline business was $6.9 million for 2008 compared to $35.4 million for 2007. Offshore natural gas transportation volumes were 1,408 BBtus/d during 2008 versus 1,641 BBtus/d during 2007. Gross operating margin from our Independence Trail pipeline, which first received production in July 2007, increased $28.4 million year-to-year on a 241 BBtus/d increase in transportation volumes. Collectively, gross operating margin from our other offshore natural gas pipelines decreased $56.9 million year-to-year primarily due to the effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Results for 2008 include $29.9 million of hurricane-related property damage repair expenses. Petrochemical Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $167.6 million for 2008 compared to $172.3 million for 2007. Gross operating margin from our propylene fractionation and pipeline business was $83.1 million for 2008 compared to $62.6 million for 2007. The $20.5 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is largely due to higher propylene sales margins during 2008 relative to 2007. Results for our propylene fractionation and related pipeline business for 2008 include $0.8 million of hurricane-related property damage repair expenses. Gross operating margin from our butane isomerization business was $95.9 million for 2008 compared to $91.4 million for 2007. The $4.5 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to strong demand for high-purity isobutane and higher NGL prices, which resulted in higher by-product sales revenues during 2008 relative to 2007. Butane isomerization volumes decreased to 86 MBPD during 2008 compared to 90 MBPD during 2007 due to production interruptions resulting from Hurricane Ike and operational issues at our octane enhancement facility during the third quarter of 2008. Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement business was a loss of $11.3 million for 2008 compared to $18.3 million of earnings for 2007. The $29.6 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is primarily due to downtime, reduced volumes and higher operating expenses as a result of operational issues during the third quarter of 2008 and the effects of Hurricane Ike. Comparison of 2007 with 2006 Revenues for 2007 were $16.95 billion compared to $13.99 billion for 2006. The $2.96 billion year-to-year increase in consolidated revenues is primarily due to higher sales volumes and energy commodity prices in 2007 relative to 2006. These factors accounted for a $2.94 billion increase in consolidated revenues associated with our marketing activities. Revenues from business interruption insurance proceeds totaled $36.1 million in 2007 compared to $63.9 million in 2006. Operating costs and expenses were $16.01 billion for 2007 versus $13.09 billion for 2006. The $2.92 billion year-to-year increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses is primarily due to an increase in the cost of sales associated with our marketing activities. The cost of sales of our NGL, natural gas and petrochemical products increased $2.45 billion year-to-year as a result of an increase in volumes and higher energy commodity prices. Operating costs and expenses associated with our natural gas processing plants increased $185.7 million year-to-year as a result of higher energy commodity prices in 2007 relative to 2006. Operating costs and expenses associated with assets we constructed and placed into service or acquired since January 1, 2006 increased $188.1 million year-to-year. General and administrative costs were $87.7 million for 2007 compared to $63.4 million for 2006. The $24.3 million year-to-year increase in general and administrative costs is primarily due to the recognition of a severance obligation during 2007 and an increase in legal fees. Changes in our revenues and costs and expenses year-to-year are explained in part by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $1.19 per gallon during 2007 versus $1.00 per gallon during 2006. The Henry Hub market price of natural gas averaged $6.86 per MMBtu during 2007 versus $7.24 per MMBtu during 2006. For additional historical energy commodity pricing information, see “Results of Operations – Selected Price and Volumetric Data” within this Item 7. 69 Table of Contents Equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates were $29.7 million for 2007 compared to $21.6 million for 2006. Equity in earnings from our investment in Jonah increased $9.1 million year-to-year due to an increase in our ownership interest in Jonah effective during the third quarter of 2007. Equity in earnings for 2007 include a non-cash impairment charge of $7.0 million associated with our investment in Nemo compared to a non-cash impairment charge of $7.4 million in 2006 related to our investment in Neptune Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (“Neptune”). Collectively, equity in earnings from our other unconsolidated affiliates decreased $1.4 million year-to-year primarily due to the sale of our investment in Coyote Gas Treating, LLC in August 2006. Operating income for 2007 was $883.0 million compared to $860.1 million for 2006. Collectively, the aforementioned changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates contributed to the $22.9 million increase in operating income year-to-year. Interest expense increased $73.7 million year-to-year primarily due to our issuance of junior subordinated notes in the second quarter of 2007 and third quarter of 2006 and the issuance of Senior Notes L in the third quarter of 2007. Our consolidated interest expense for 2007 includes $11.6 million associated with Duncan Energy Partners’ credit facility. Our average debt principal outstanding was $6.18 billion in 2007 compared to $4.92 billion in 2006. Minority interest increased $21.6 million year-to-year attributable to the public unit holders of Duncan Energy Partners and third-party ownership interests in the Independence Hub platform. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, our consolidated net income decreased $67.5 million year-to-year to $533.7 million in 2007 compared to $601.2 million in 2006. Net income for 2006 includes a $1.5 million benefit relating to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. For additional information regarding the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we recorded in 2006, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $812.5 million for 2007 compared to $752.5 million for 2006. Gross operating margin for 2007 includes $32.7 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims compared to $40.4 million of proceeds during 2006. Strong demand for NGLs in 2007 compared to 2006 led to higher natural gas processing margins, increased volumes of natural gas processed under fee-based contracts and higher NGL throughput volumes at certain of our pipelines and fractionation facilities. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding proceeds from business interruption insurance claims. Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and storage was $302.2 million for 2007 compared to $265.7 million for 2006. Total NGL transportation volumes increased to 1,666 MBPD during 2007 from 1,577 MBPD during 2006. The $36.5 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher pipeline transportation and NGL storage volumes at certain of our facilities and higher transportation fees charged to shippers on our Mid-America Pipeline System. Our DEP South Texas NGL Pipeline contributed $21.1 million of gross operating margin and 73 MBPD of NGL transportation volumes during 2007. The increase in gross operating margin year-to-year was partially offset by lower volumes and higher costs resulting from the November 2007 rupture of the Dixie Pipeline and a one-time benefit in 2006 for the settlement of a pipeline contamination incident. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business was $389.1 million for 2007 compared to $359.7 million for 2006. The $29.4 million increase in gross operating margin year-to-year is largely due to improved results from our South Texas, Louisiana and Chaco natural gas processing facilities attributable to higher volumes and equity NGL sales revenues, all of which were partially offset by expenses associated with start-up delays at our Meeker and Pioneer natural gas processing plants. Fee-based processing volumes increased to 2.6 Bcf/d during 2007 from 2.2 Bcf/d during 2006. Equity NGL production increased to 88 MBPD during 2007 from 63 MBPD during 2006. 70 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation was $88.4 million for 2007 compared to $86.8 million for 2006. Fractionation volumes increased from 312 MBPD during 2006 to 394 MBPD during 2007. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin of $1.6 million is primarily due to higher volumes at our Norco NGL fractionator during 2007 relative to 2006. Our Norco NGL fractionator returned to normal operating rates in the second quarter of 2006 after suffering a reduction of fractionation volumes due to the effects of Hurricane Katrina. Gross operating margin attributable to our Hobbs NGL fractionator, which became operational in August 2007, was largely offset by start-up expenses. Fractionation volumes for 2007 include 36 MBPD from our Hobbs fractionator. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $335.7 million for 2007 compared to $333.4 million for 2006. Our total onshore natural gas transportation volumes were 6,632 BBtus/d for 2007 compared to 6,012 BBtus/d for 2006. Gross operating margin from our onshore natural gas pipeline business was $307.2 million for 2007 compared to $312.3 million for 2006. The $5.1 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin from this business is largely due to higher operating costs on our Acadian Gas System, Carlsbad Gathering System and our Texas Intrastate System. Results from our onshore natural gas pipeline business for 2007 include $5.5 million of gross operating margin from our Piceance Creek Gathering System, which we acquired in December 2006. Equity in earnings from our investment in Jonah increased $9.1 million year-to-year. The Piceance Creek Gathering System and our net share of the gathering volumes on the Jonah Gathering System contributed 789 BBtus/d, collectively, of natural gas gathering volumes during 2007. Gross operating margin from our natural gas storage business was $28.4 million for 2007 compared to $21.1 million for 2006. The $7.3 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is largely due to our Wilson natural gas storage facility attributable to lower repair costs in 2007 relative to 2006 and a 2006 loss on the sale of cushion gas. Our Wilson natural gas storage facility remained out of operation through 2007 due to ongoing repairs. Gross operating margin from our Petal facility includes an $8.4 million benefit in 2006 for a well measurement gain. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $171.6 million for 2007 compared to $103.4 million for 2006, a year-to-year increase of $68.2 million. Our Independence project contributed $85.0 million of gross operating margin during 2007 on average natural gas throughput of 423 BBtus/d. Segment gross operating margin for 2007 includes $3.4 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims compared to $23.5 million of proceeds in 2006. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding proceeds from business interruption insurance claims. Gross operating margin from our offshore platform services business was $111.7 million for 2007 compared to $34.6 million for 2006. The $77.1 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to our start up of the Independence Hub Platform in 2007, which contributed $63.6 million of gross operating margin in 2007. In addition, gross operating margin from the remainder of this business increased $13.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher volumes during 2007 versus 2006. Our net platform natural gas processing volumes increased to 494 MMcf/d in 2007 from 159 MMcf/d in 2006. Gross operating margin from our offshore natural gas pipeline business was $35.4 million for 2007 compared to $22.4 million for 2006. Offshore natural gas transportation volumes were 1,641 BBtus/d during 2007 versus 1,520 BBtus/d during 2006. Our Independence Trail Pipeline reported $21.4 million of gross operating margin and 423 BBtus/d of transportation volumes for 2007. Results from our Independence Trail Pipeline were partially offset by a decrease in volumes and revenues from our Viosca Knoll Gathering System and Constitution Gas Pipeline. Gross operating margin for 2007 includes a non-cash impairment charge of $7.0 million associated with our investment in Nemo compared to charge of $7.4 million in 2006 related to our investment in Neptune. Gross operating margin from our offshore crude oil pipeline business was $21.1 million for 2007 versus $23.0 million for 2006. The $1.9 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is 71 Table of Contents primarily due to lower transportation volumes on our certain of our offshore crude oil pipelines and higher operating costs on our Poseidon Oil Pipeline System during 2007 relative to 2006. An increase in revenues year-to-year on our Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System attributable to higher volumes was more than offset by a one-time expense of $8.8 million associated with the early termination of Cameron Highway’s credit facility. Crude oil transportation volumes on our Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System net to our ownership interest were 44 MBPD during 2007 compared to 32 MBPD during 2006. Total offshore crude oil transportation volumes were 163 MBPD during 2007 versus 153 MBPD during 2006. Petrochemical Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $172.3 million for 2007 compared to $173.1 million for 2006. Gross operating margin from our butane isomerization business was $91.4 million for 2007 compared to $73.2 million for 2006. The $18.2 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is attributable to higher processing volumes and by-products sales revenues. Butane isomerization volumes were 90 MBPD for 2007 compared to 81 MBPD for 2006. Gross operating margin from our propylene fractionation and pipeline activities was $62.6 million for 2007 versus $63.4 million for 2006. The $0.8 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is primarily attributable to higher operating costs and expenses attributable to our propylene pipelines and our propylene storage and export facility. Petrochemical transportation volumes were 105 MBPD during 2007 compared to 97 MBPD during 2006. Gross operating margin from octane enhancement was $18.3 million for 2007 compared to $36.6 million for 2006. The year-to-year decrease of $18.3 million is primarily due to lower sales margins in 2007 relative to 2006. Octane enhancement production was 9 MBPD during 2007 and 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses and debt service, are for working capital, capital expenditures, business acquisitions and distributions to partners. We expect to fund our short-term needs for such items as operating expenses and sustaining capital expenditures with operating cash flows and short-term revolving credit arrangements. Capital expenditures for long-term needs resulting from business expansion projects and acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources (either separately or in combination) including operating cash flows, borrowings under credit facilities, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities and proceeds from divestitures of ownership interests in assets to affiliates or third parties. We expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash flows. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and/or refinancing arrangements. At December 31, 2008, we had $35.4 million of unrestricted cash on hand and approximately $1.30 billion of available credit under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and a new credit facility executed in November 2008. We had approximately $9.05 billion in principal outstanding under consolidated debt agreements at December 31, 2008. In total, our consolidated liquidity at December 31, 2008 was approximately $1.49 billion, which includes the available borrowing capacity of our consolidated subsidiaries such as Duncan Energy Partners. Registration Statements We may issue equity or debt securities to assist us in meeting our liquidity and capital spending requirements. Duncan Energy Partners may do likewise in meeting its liquidity and capital spending requirements. We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC that would allow us to issue an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities for general partnership purposes. In April 2008, EPO issued $1.10 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate, unsecured senior notes under this registration statement. In December 2008, EPO also issued $500.0 million in principal amount of fixed-rate, unsecured senior notes. Net proceeds from these senior note offerings were used to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and for general partnership purposes. 72 Table of Contents In January 2009, we sold 10,590,000 common units (including an over-allotment of 990,000 common units) to the public at an offering price of $22.20 per unit. We used the net proceeds of $225.6 million from the offering to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility, which may be reborrowed to fund capital expenditures and other growth projects, and for general partnership purposes. During 2003, we instituted a distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”). We have a registration statement on file with the SEC authorizing the issuance of up to 25,000,000 common units in connection with the DRIP. The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they would otherwise receive into the purchase of additional common units of our partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we issued 5,368,310 common units in connection with our DRIP, which generated proceeds of $134.7 million from plan participants. In November 2008, affiliates of EPCO reinvested $67.0 million in connection with the DRIP. We also have a registration statement on file related to our employee unit purchase plan, under which we can issue up to 1,200,000 common units. Under this plan, employees of EPCO can purchase our common units at a 10.0% discount through payroll deductions. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we issued 155,636 common units to employees under this plan, which generated proceeds of $4.5 million. In March 2008, Duncan Energy Partners filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC that authorized its issuance of up to $1.00 billion in debt and equity securities. In December 2008, Duncan Energy Partners issued $0.5 million in equity securities under its registration statement. For information regarding our public debt obligations or partnership equity, see Notes 14 and 15, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Letter of Credit Facility In October 2008, EPO entered into a $100.0 million letter of credit facility. EPO issued a $70.0 million letter of credit under this new facility, which remained outstanding at December 31, 2008. This letter of credit facility does not reduce the amount available under our Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. Credit Ratings of EPO At March 2, 2009, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s senior unsecured debt securities remain unchanged from 2008 at Baa3 by Moody’s Investor Services; BBB- by Fitch Ratings; and BBB- by Standard and Poor’s. Such ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it determines that the circumstances warrant such a change and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Based on the characteristics of the $1.25 billion of fixed/floating unsecured junior subordinated notes that EPO issued in 2006 and 2007, the rating agencies assigned partial equity treatment to the notes. Moody’s Investor Services and Standard and Poor’s each assigned 50.0% equity treatment and Fitch Ratings assigned 75.0% equity treatment. In connection with the construction of our Pascagoula, Mississippi natural gas processing plant, EPO entered into a $54.0 million, ten-year, fixed-rate loan with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation (“MBFC”). The indenture agreement for this loan contains an acceleration clause whereby if EPO’s credit rating by Moody’s Investor Services declines below Baa3 in combination with our credit rating at Standard & Poor’s declining below BBB-, the $54.0 million principal balance of this loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest would become immediately due and payable 120 days 73 Table of Contents following such event. If such an event occurred, EPO would have to either redeem the Pascagoula MBFC Loan or provide an alternative credit agreement to support its obligation under this loan. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (dollars in millions). For information regarding the individual components of our cash flow amounts, see the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 1,237.1 $ 1,590.9 $ 1,175.1 Cash used in investing activities 2,411.9 2,553.6 1,689.3 Cash provided by financing activities 1,171.0 979.4 495.0 Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our business activities. As a result, these cash flows are exposed to certain risks. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry. We provide services for producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and certain petrochemicals. The products that we process, sell or transport are principally used as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating; feedstock in petrochemical manufacturing; and in the production of motor gasoline. Reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers, whether because of a decline in general economic conditions, reduced demand for the end products made with our products, or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons, could have a negative impact on our earnings and operating cash flows. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this annual report. Our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method. The indirect method derives net cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income to remove (i) the effects of all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments, such as changes during the period in inventory, deferred income and similar transactions, (ii) the effects of all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and cash payments, such as changes during the period in receivables and payables, (iii) other non-cash amounts such as depreciation, amortization, operating lease expense paid by EPCO, changes in the fair market value of financial instruments and equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates (net cash flows provided by operating activities reflect the actual cash distributions we receive from such investees), and (iv) the effects of all items classified as investing or financing cash flows, such as proceeds from asset sales and related transactions or extinguishment of debt. In general, the net effect of changes in operating accounts results from the timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for purchases and other expenses during each period. Increases or decreases in inventory are influenced by the quantity of products held in connection with our marketing activities and changes in energy commodity prices. Cash used in investing activities primarily represents expenditures for additions to property, plant and equipment, business combinations and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Cash provided by financing activities generally consists of borrowings and repayments of debt, distributions to partners and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities. Amounts presented in our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for borrowings and repayments under debt agreements are influenced by the magnitude of cash receipts and payments under our revolving credit facilities. 74 Table of Contents The following information highlights the significant year-to-year variances in our cash flow amounts: Comparison of 2008 with 2007 Operating Activities. Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1.24 billion for 2008 compared to $1.59 billion for 2007. The $353.9 million decrease in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following: § Net cash flows from consolidated operations (excluding distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates and cash payments for interest) decreased $262.6 million year-to-year. Although our gross operating margin increased year-to-year (see “Results of Operations” within this Item 7), the reduction in operating cash flow is generally due to the timing of related cash receipts and disbursements. The $262.6 million total year-to-year decrease also reflects a $127.3 million decrease in cash proceeds we received from insurance claims related to certain named storms. For information regarding proceeds from business interruption and property damage claims, see Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates increased $25.0 million year-to-year primarily due to increased distributions from Jonah and Cameron Highway. § Cash payments for interest increased $116.3 million year-to-year primarily due to increased borrowings to finance our capital spending program. Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $2.41 billion for 2008 compared to $2.55 billion for 2007. The $141.7 million decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: § Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs, decreased $174.6 million year-to-year. For additional information related to our capital spending program, see “Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. § Cash outlays for investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $208.9 million year-to-year. Expenditures for 2007 include the $216.5 million we contributed to Cameron Highway during the second quarter of 2007. Cameron Highway used these funds, along with an equal contribution from our 50.0% joint venture partner in Cameron Highway, to repay approximately $430.0 million of its outstanding debt. In addition, cash contributions to Jonah decreased $83.0 million year-to-year as a result of the completion of an expansion project in June 2008. Expenditures for 2008 include $22.5 million in contributions to White River Hub, LLC, $36.0 million to acquire a 49.0% interest in Skelly-Belvieu Pipeline Company, L.L.C., and $35.9 million in contributions to the Texas Offshore Port System joint venture. § An $85.4 million increase in restricted cash (a cash outflow) due to margin requirements primarily due to our hedging activities. See Item 7A of this annual report for information regarding our interest rate and commodity risk hedging portfolios. § Cash used for business combinations increased $166.4 million year-to-year primarily due to the acquisition of a 100.0% membership interest in Great Divide Gathering LLC for $125.2 million, the acquisition of the remaining interests in Dixie for $57.1 million and the acquisition of additional interests in Tri-States NGL Pipeline, L.L.C (“Tri-States”) for $18.7 million. Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.17 billion for 2008 compared to $979.4 million for 2007. This $191.6 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the following: 75 Table of Contents § Net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements increased $588.9 million year-to-year. In April 2008, EPO sold $400.0 million in principal amount of fixed-rate unsecured senior notes (“Senior Notes M”) and $700.0 million in principal amount of fixed-rate unsecured senior notes (“Senior Notes N”). In November 2008, EPO executed a Japanese yen term loan agreement in the amount of 20.7 billion yen (approximately $217.6 million U.S. dollar equivalent). In December 2008, EPO sold $500.0 million in principal amount of fixed-rate unsecured senior notes (“Senior Notes O”). We used the proceeds from these borrowings primarily to repay amounts borrowed under our Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and, to a lesser extent, for general partnership purposes. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Net proceeds from the issuance of our common units increased $73.6 million year-to-year due to increased participation in our DRIP. § Contributions from minority interests decreased $302.9 million year-to-year primarily due to the initial public offering of Duncan Energy Partners in February 2007, which generated proceeds of $290.5 million. § Cash distributions to our partners and minority interests increased $103.2 million year-to-year primarily due to increases in our common units outstanding and quarterly distribution rates, increases in the quarterly distribution rates of Duncan Energy Partners and distributions paid to Independence Hub’s joint venture partner. § The early termination and settlement of interest rate hedging financial instruments during 2008 resulted in net cash payments of $14.4 million compared to net cash receipts of $48.9 million during the same period in 2007, which resulted in a $63.3 million decrease in financing cash flows between years. Comparison of 2007 with 2006 Operating activities. Net cash flows provided by operating activities was $1.59 billion for 2007 compared to $1.18 billion for 2006. The $415.9 million year-to-year increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following: § Our net cash flows from consolidated businesses (excluding distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates and cash payments for interest and taxes) increased $436.8 million year-to-year. The improvement in cash flow is generally due to increased gross operating margin and the timing of related cash collections and disbursements between periods. The $436.8 million total year-to-year increase also reflects a $42.1 million increase in cash proceeds we received from insurance claims related to certain named storms. § Cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates increased $30.6 million year-to-year primarily due to improved earnings from our Gulf of Mexico investments, which were negatively impacted during 2006 as a result of the lingering effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. § Cash payments for interest increased $56.2 million year-to-year primarily due to increased borrowings to finance our capital spending program. Our average debt balance for 2007 was $6.26 billion compared to $4.93 billion for 2006. § Cash payments for taxes decreased $4.7 million year-to-year. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $2.55 billion for 2007 compared to $1.69 billion for 2006. The $864.3 million year-to-year increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: § An $847.7 million increase in capital spending for property, plant and equipment (net of contributions in aid of construction costs) and a $194.6 million increase in investments in unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by a $240.7 million decrease in cash outlays for business combinations. § We contributed $216.5 million to Cameron Highway during the second quarter of 2007. Cameron Highway used these funds, along with an equal contribution from our 50.0% joint venture partner in Cameron Highway, to repay approximately $430.0 million of its outstanding debt. 76 Table of Contents § During 2006, we paid $100.0 million for Piceance Creek Pipeline, LLC and $145.2 million for the Encinal acquisition. Our spending for business combinations during 2007 was limited and primarily due to the $35.0 million we paid to acquire the South Monco pipeline business. § Restricted cash increased $38.6 million (a cash outflow) year-to-year. Financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $979.4 million for 2007 versus $495.0 million for 2006. The $484.4 million year-to-year increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the following: § Net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements increased $1.10 billion year-to-year. In May 2007, EPO sold $700.0 million in principal amount of fixed/floating unsecured junior subordinated notes (Junior Notes B”). In September 2007, EPO sold $800.0 million in principal amount of fixed-rate unsecured senior notes (“Senior Notes L”) and in October 2007, EPO repaid $500.0 million in principal amount of fixed-rate unsecured senior notes (“Senior Notes E”). § Net proceeds from the issuance of our common units decreased $788.0 million year-to-year. We completed underwritten equity offerings in March and September of 2006 that generated net proceeds of $750.8 million reflecting the sale of 31,050,000 common units. § Contributions from minority interests increased $275.4 million year-to-year primarily due to the initial public offering of Duncan Energy Partners in February 2007, which generated net proceeds of $290.5 million from the sale of 14,950,000 of its common units. See “Other Items – Duncan Energy Partners Transactions” within this Item 7 for additional information regarding Duncan Energy Partners. § Cash distributions to our partners and minority interests increased $137.9 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in common units outstanding and our quarterly cash distribution rates. § We received $48.9 million from the settlement of treasury lock financial instruments during 2007 related to our interest rate risk hedging activities. Capital Spending An integral part of our business strategy involves expansion through business combinations, growth capital projects and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are positioned to continue to grow our system of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas and/or crude oil production from resource basins such as the Piceance Basin of western Colorado, the Greater Green River Basin in Wyoming, Barnett Shale in North Texas, and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Management continues to analyze potential acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. In past years, major oil and gas companies have sold non-strategic assets in the midstream energy sector in which we operate. We forecast that this trend will continue, and expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestitures. 77 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our capital spending by activity for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Capital spending for business combinations: Great Divide Gathering System acquisition $ 125,175 $ -- $ -- Encinal acquisition, excluding non-cash consideration (1) -- 114 145,197 Piceance Basin Gathering System acquisition -- 368 100,000 South Monco Pipeline System acquisition 1 35,000 -- Canadian Enterprise Gas Products, Ltd. acquisition -- -- 17,690 Additional ownership interests in Dixie 57,089 311 12,913 Additional ownership interests in Belle Rose NGL Pipeline, LLC 1,200 -- -- Additional ownership interests in Tri-States 18,695 -- -- Other business combinations -- -- 700 Total 202,160 35,793 276,500 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net: (2) Growth capital projects (3) 1,773,000 1,986,157 1,148,123 Sustaining capital projects (4) 180,676 142,096 132,455 Total 1,953,676 2,128,253 1,280,578 Capital spending for intangible assets: Acquisition of intangible assets (5) 5,126 11,232 -- Capital spending attributable to unconsolidated affiliates: Investments in unconsolidated affiliates (6) 129,816 332,909 138,266 Total capital spending $ 2,290,778 $ 2,508,187 $ 1,695,344 (1) Excludes $181.1 million of non-cash consideration paid to the seller in the form of 7,115,844 of our common units. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our business combinations. (2) On certain of our capital projects, third parties are obligated to reimburse us for all or a portion of project expenditures. The majority of such arrangements are associated with projects related to pipeline construction and production well tie-ins. Contributions in aid of construction costs were $25.8 million, $57.5 million and $60.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (3) Growth capital projects either result in additional revenue streams from existing assets or expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams. (4) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to and major renewals of existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues. (5) Amount for 2008 represents the acquisition of permits for our Mont Belvieu storage facility. Amount for 2007 represents the acquisition of nitric oxide credits at our Morgan’s Point Facility. (6) Fiscal 2007 includes $216.5 million in cash contributions to Cameron Highway to fund our share of the repayment of its debt obligations. Based on information currently available, we estimate our consolidated capital spending for 2009 will approximate $1.00 billion, which includes estimated expenditures of $820.0 million for growth capital projects and acquisitions and $180.0 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our forecast of consolidated capital expenditures is based on our current announced strategic operating and growth plans, which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or from other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, issuance of equity, and potential divestitures of certain assets to third and/or related parties. Our forecast of capital expenditures may change due to factors beyond our control, such as weather related issues, changes in supplier prices or adverse economic conditions. Furthermore, our forecast may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include acquisitions or decisions to take on additional partners. Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a principal factor that determines how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future operating growth needs, and although we currently intend to make the forecasted expenditures discussed above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital markets. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $521.3 million in purchase commitments outstanding that relate to our capital spending for property, plant and equipment. These commitments primarily relate to construction of our Barnett Shale natural gas pipeline projects and Meeker natural gas processing plant expansion. 78 Table of Contents Significant Ongoing Growth Capital Projects The following table summarizes information regarding certain ongoing significant announced growth capital projects (dollars in millions). Actual costs noted for each project reflects our share of cash expenditures as of December 31, 2008, excluding capitalized interest. The current forecast amount noted for each project also reflects our share of project expenditures, excluding estimated capitalized interest. Current Estimated Forecast Date of Actual Total Project Name Completion Costs Cost Sherman Extension Pipeline (Barnett Shale) 2009 $ 457.0 $ 489.2 Shenzi Oil Pipeline 2009 135.8 153.5 Marathon Piceance Basin pipeline projects 2009 36.6 151.3 Trinity River Basin Extension 2009 16.4 232.6 Expansion of Wilson natural gas storage facility 2010 51.1 119.6 Texas Offshore Port System To be determined 30.0 600.0 Sherman Extension Pipeline (Barnett Shale). In November 2006, we announced an expansion of our Texas Intrastate System with the construction of the Sherman Extension that will transport up to 1.1 Bcf/d of natural gas from the growing Barnett Shale area of North Texas. The Sherman Extension is supported by long-term contracts with Devon Energy Corporation, the largest producer in the Barnett Shale area, and significant indications of interest from leading producers and gatherers in the Fort Worth basin, as well as other shippers on our Texas Intrastate Pipeline system. At its terminus, the new pipeline system will make deliveries into Boardwalk Pipeline Partners L.P.’s Gulf Crossing Expansion Project, which will provide export capacity for Barnett Shale natural gas production to multiple delivery points in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama that offer access to attractive markets in the Northeast and Southeast United States. In addition, the Sherman Extension will provide natural gas producers in East Texas and the Waha area of West Texas with access to these higher value markets through our Texas Intrastate Pipeline system. The Sherman Extension will originate near Morgan Mill, Texas and extend through the center of the current Barnett Shale development area to Sherman, Texas. In 2008, we placed into service portions of the Sherman Extension. The Sherman Extension is scheduled for final completion in March 2009. The Barnett Shale is considered to be one of the largest unconventional natural gas resource plays in North America, covering approximately 14 counties and over seven million acres in the Fort Worth basin in North Texas. Current natural gas production is estimated at 3.4 Bcf/d from approximately 7,800 wells. Approximately 190 rigs are currently estimated to be working to develop Barnett Shale acreage in the region. According to the United States Geological Survey, the Barnett Shale has the resource potential of approximately 26 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Shenzi Oil Pipeline. In October 2006, we announced the execution of definitive agreements with producers to construct, own and operate an oil export pipeline that will provide firm gathering services from the BHP Billiton Plc-operated Shenzi production field located in the South Green Canyon area of the central Gulf of Mexico. The Shenzi oil export pipeline will originate at the Shenzi Field, located in 4,300 feet of water at Green Canyon Block 653, approximately 120 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The 83-mile, 20-inch diameter pipeline will have the capacity to transport up to 230 MBPD of crude oil and will connect the Shenzi Field to our Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline and Poseidon Oil Pipeline System at our Ship Shoal 332B junction platform. We own a 50.0% interest in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline and a 36.0% interest in the Poseidon Oil Pipeline System and operate both pipelines. The Shenzi oil export pipeline will connect to a platform being constructed by BHP Billiton Plc to develop the Shenzi Field, which is expected to commence operations during the second quarter of 2009. Marathon Piceance Basin pipeline projects. In December 2006, we entered into a long-term contract with Marathon Oil Company (“Marathon”) to provide a range of midstream energy services, including natural gas gathering, compression, treating and processing, for Marathon’s natural gas production in the Piceance Basin of northwest Colorado. Under the terms of the contract, we are 79 Table of Contents constructing 50 miles of gathering lines and related assets to connect Marathon’s multi-well drilling sites, production from which is expected to peak at approximately 180 MMcf/d, to our Piceance Creek Gathering System. From there the natural gas will be delivered to our Meeker natural gas processing facility. Trinity River Basin Extension. In August 2008, we announced the development of a new 40-mile supply lateral that will extend from the Trinity River Basin north of Arlington, Texas to an interconnect with the Sherman Extension pipeline near Justin, Texas to accommodate growing natural gas production from the Barnett Shale. This new pipeline will consist of 30-inch and 36-inch diameter pipeline designed to provide up to 1.0 Bcf/d of natural gas takeaway capacity for producers in Tarrant and Denton counties. This new pipeline will also have a lateral to provide transportation services for natural gas produced from the Newark East field in Wise County. These new pipeline laterals are anchored by long-term agreements with major producers and are expected to be in-service by year end 2009. Expansion of Wilson natural gas storage facility. We are developing a new natural gas storage cavern located on the Boling Salt Dome near Boling, Texas. The cavern is designed to store approximately 7.9 Bcf of natural gas, of which approximately 5.0 Bcf will be working gas capacity and 2.9 Bcf will be the base gas requirements needed to support minimum pressures. This expansion project was approved by the Texas Railroad Commission and is projected to commence operations in 2010. We expect to secure binding precedent agreements on all capacity before the cavern commences operations. Texas Offshore Port System (TOPS and PACE). In August 2008, we, together with TEPPCO and Oiltanking, announced the formation of a joint venture to design, construct, operate and own a Texas offshore crude oil port and a related onshore pipeline and storage system that would facilitate delivery of waterborne crude oil to refining centers located along the upper Texas Gulf Coast. We, TEPPCO and Oiltanking each own, through our respective subsidiaries, a one-third interest in the joint venture. For additional information regarding this joint venture and its capital projects, see “Recent Developments – Texas Offshore Port System” within this Item 7. Pipeline Integrity Costs Our NGL, petrochemical and natural gas pipelines are subject to pipeline safety programs administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation, through its Office of Pipeline Safety. This federal agency has issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines (which include NGL and petrochemical pipelines) and natural gas pipelines. In general, these regulations require companies to assess the condition of their pipelines in certain high consequence areas (as defined by the regulation) and to perform any necessary repairs. In April 2002, a subsidiary of ours acquired several midstream energy assets located in Texas and New Mexico from El Paso Corporation (“El Paso”). These assets included the Texas Intrastate System and the Carlsbad Gathering Systems. With respect to such assets, El Paso agreed to indemnify our subsidiary for any pipeline integrity costs it incurred (whether paid or payable) for five years following the acquisition date. The indemnity provisions did not take effect until such costs exceeded $3.3 million annually; however, the amount reimbursable by El Paso was capped at $50.2 million in the aggregate. In 2007 and 2006, we recovered $31.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively from El Paso related to our 2006 and 2005 expenditures. During 2007, we received a final amount of $5.4 million from El Paso related to this indemnity. The following table summarizes our pipeline integrity costs, net of indemnity payments from El Paso, for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Expensed $ 48,664 $ 43,499 $ 26,397 Capitalized 63,976 52,420 38,180 Total $ 112,640 $ 95,919 $ 64,577 80 Table of Contents We expect our cash outlay for the pipeline integrity program, irrespective of whether such costs are capitalized or expensed, to approximate $107.0 million in 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting process, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following describes the estimation risk currently underlying our most significant financial statement items: Depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the assets. Our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in-service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include: § changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset; § changes in technology that render an asset obsolete; § changes in expected salvage values; or § changes in the forecast life of applicable resource basins, if any. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was $13.15 billion and $11.59 billion, respectively. We recorded $466.1 million, $414.9 million, and $350.8 million in depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Notes 2 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring recoverability of long-lived assets and equity method investments In general, long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, oil or NGLs. Long-lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through expected future cash flows are written-down to their estimated fair values. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the existing asset. Our estimates of such undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated salvage values. An impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is based on a series of assumptions similar to those used to derive undiscounted cash flows. Those assumptions also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes, market values and replacement cost estimates. 81 Table of Contents An equity method investment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible loss in value of the investment other than a temporary decline. Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee’s industry. Equity method investments with carrying values that are not expected to be recovered through expected future cash flows are written down to their estimated fair values. The carrying value of an equity method investment is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of discounted estimated cash flows expected to be derived from the investment. This estimate of discounted cash flows is based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment. A significant change in these underlying assumptions could result in our recording an impairment charge. We recognized a non-cash asset impairment charge related to property, plant and equipment of $0.1 million in 2006, which is reflected as a component of operating costs and expenses. No such asset impairment charges were recorded in 2008 or 2007. During 2007, we evaluated our equity method investment in Nemo for impairment. As a result of this evaluation, we recorded a $7.0 million non-cash impairment charge that is a component of equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2007. Similarly, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we evaluated our equity method investment in Neptune for impairment and recorded a $7.4 million non-cash impairment charge. During 2008 there were no such impairment charges. For additional information regarding impairment charges associated with our long-lived assets and equity method investments, see Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Amortization methods and estimated useful lives of qualifying intangible assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential intangible assets include intellectual property, such as technology, patents, trademarks and trade names, customer contracts and relationships, and non-compete agreements, as well as other intangible assets. The method used to value each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset, the business in which it is utilized, and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. Our customer relationship intangible assets primarily represent the customer base we acquired in connection with business combinations and asset purchases. The value we assigned to these customer relationships is being amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits of the underlying oil and natural gas resource bases from which the customers produce are estimated to be consumed or otherwise used. Our estimate of the useful life of each resource base is based on a number of factors, including reserve estimates, the economic viability of production and exploration activities and other industry factors. Our contract-based intangible assets represent the rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated useful life (or term), which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of an entity. Our estimates of useful life are based on a number of factors, including: § the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., fractionation facility, pipeline, etc.); § any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights; and § any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such agreements. If our underlying assumptions regarding the estimated useful life of an intangible asset change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, if we determine 82 Table of Contents that an intangible asset’s unamortized cost may not be recoverable due to impairment; we may be required to reduce the carrying value and the subsequent useful life of the asset. Any such write-down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was $855.4 million and $917.0 million, respectively. We recorded $88.4 million, $89.7 million, and $88.8 million in amortization expense associated with our intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Methods we employ to measure the fair value of goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase prices we paid for certain businesses over their respective fair values. We do not amortize goodwill; however, we test our goodwill (at the reporting unit level) for impairment during the second quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Our goodwill testing involves the determination of a reporting unit’s fair value, which is predicated on our assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the reporting unit. Such assumptions include: § discrete financial forecasts for the assets contained within the reporting unit, which rely on management’s estimates of operating margins and transportation volumes; § long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and § appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of the reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a charge to earnings is required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying value of our goodwill was $706.9 million and $591.7 million, respectively. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the periods presented. For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our revenue recognition policies and use of estimates for revenues and expenses In general, we recognize revenue from our customers when all of the following criteria are met: § persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; § delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; § the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable; and § collectability is reasonably assured. We record revenue when sales contracts are settled (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed). We record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts as required by our established policy. 83 Table of Contents Our use of certain estimates for revenues and expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the timing to compile actual billing information and receiving third-party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of such use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for the subject period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month, adjusted accordingly for any known or expected changes in volumes or rates through the end of the month. If the basis of our estimates proves to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying notes. Reserves for environmental matters Each of our business segments is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations may, in certain instances, require us to remediate current or former operating sites where specified substances have been released or disposed of. We accrue reserves for environmental matters when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments are based on studies, as well as site surveys, to determine the extent of any environmental damage and the necessary requirements to remediate this damage. Future environmental developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws and additional claims for damages to property, employees and other persons resulting from current or past operations, could result in substantial additional costs beyond our current reserves. In accruing for environmental remediation liabilities, costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to their present value, unless the amount and timing of the expenditures are fixed or reliably determinable. At December 31, 2008, none of our estimated environmental remediation liabilities are discounted to present value since the ultimate amount and timing of cash payments for such liabilities are not readily determinable. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had a liability for environmental remediation of $15.4 million and $26.5 million, respectively, which was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon studies and site surveys. We follow the provisions of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96-1, which provides key guidance on recognition, measurement and disclosure of remediation liabilities. We have recorded our best estimate of the cost of remediation activities. See Item 3 of this annual report for recent developments regarding environmental matters. Natural gas imbalances In the pipeline transportation business, imbalances frequently result from differences in natural gas volumes received from and delivered to our customers. Such differences occur when a customer delivers more or less gas into our pipelines than is physically redelivered back to them during a particular time period. The vast majority of our settlements are through in-kind arrangements whereby incremental volumes are delivered to a customer (in the case of an imbalance payable) or received from a customer (in the case of an imbalance receivable). Such in-kind deliveries are on-going and take place over several months. In some cases, settlements of imbalances accumulated over a period of time are ultimately cashed out and are generally negotiated at values which approximate average market prices over a period of time. As a result, for gas imbalances that are ultimately settled over future periods, we estimate the value of such current assets and liabilities using average market prices, which is representative of the estimated value of the imbalances upon final settlement. Changes in natural gas prices may impact our estimates. 84 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our imbalance receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, were $48.4 million and $60.9 million, respectively, and are reflected as a component of “Accounts and notes receivable – trade” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this annual report. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our imbalance payables were $40.7 million and $38.3 million, respectively, and are reflected as a component of “Accrued product payables” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this annual report. Other Items Duncan Energy Partners Transactions Duncan Energy Partners was formed in September 2006 and did not acquire any assets prior to February 5, 2007, which was the date it completed its initial public offering of 14,950,000 common units and acquired controlling interests in certain midstream energy businesses of EPO. The business purpose of Duncan Energy Partners is to acquire, own and operate a diversified portfolio of midstream energy assets and to support the growth objectives of EPO and other affiliates under common control. Duncan Energy Partners is engaged in the business of transporting and storing NGLs and petrochemical products and gathering, transporting, storing and marketing of natural gas. At December 31, 2008, Duncan Energy Partners is owned 99.3% by its limited partners and 0.7% by its general partner, DEP GP, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of EPO. DEP GP is responsible for managing the business and operations of Duncan Energy Partners. DEP Operating Partnership L.P. (“DEP OLP”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Duncan Energy Partners, conducts substantially all of Duncan Energy Partners’ business. At December 31, 2008, EPO owned approximately 74.1% of Duncan Energy Partners’ limited partner interests and 100.0% of its general partner. DEP I Midstream Businesses. On February 5, 2007, EPO contributed a 66.0% controlling equity interest in each of the DEP I Midstream Businesses (defined below) to Duncan Energy Partners in a dropdown of assets. EPO retained the remaining 34.0% equity interest in each of the DEP I Midstream Businesses. The DEP I Midstream Businesses consist of (i) Mont Belvieu Caverns, LLC (“Mont Belvieu Caverns”); (ii) Acadian Gas, LLC (“Acadian Gas”); (iii) Enterprise Lou-Tex Propylene Pipeline L.P. (“Lou-Tex Propylene”), including its general partner; (iv) Sabine Propylene Pipeline L.P. (“Sabine Propylene’), including its general partner; and (v) South Texas NGL Pipelines, LLC (“South Texas NGL”). As consideration for controlling equity interests in the DEP I Midstream Businesses and reimbursement for capital expenditures related to these businesses, Duncan Energy Partners distributed to EPO (i) $260.6 million of the $290.5 million of net proceeds from its initial public offering to EPO, (ii) $198.9 million in borrowings under its revolving credit facility and (iii) a net 5,351,571 common units of Duncan Energy Partners. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding the debt obligations of Duncan Energy Partners. DEP II Midstream Businesses. On December 8, 2008, Duncan Energy Partners entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “DEP II Purchase Agreement”) with EPO and Enterprise GTM Holdings L.P. (“Enterprise GTM,” a wholly owned subsidiary of EPO). Pursuant to the DEP II Purchase Agreement, DEP OLP acquired 100.0% of the membership interests in Enterprise Holding III, LLC (“Enterprise III”) from Enterprise GTM, thereby acquiring a 66.0% general partner interest in Enterprise GC, a 51.0% general partner interest in Enterprise Intrastate and a 51.0% membership interest in Enterprise Texas. Collectively, we refer to Enterprise GC, Enterprise Intrastate and Enterprise Texas as the “DEP II Midstream Businesses.” EPO was the sponsor of this second dropdown transaction. Enterprise GTM retained the remaining limited partner and member interests in the DEP II Midstream Businesses. As consideration for controlling equity interests in the DEP II Midstream Businesses, EPO received $280.5 million in cash and 37,333,887 Class B limited partner units having a market value of $449.5 million from Duncan Energy Partners. The Class B limited partner units automatically converted to 85 Table of Contents common units of Duncan Energy Partners on February 1, 2009. The total value of the consideration provided to EPO and Enterprise GTM was $730.0 million. The cash portion of the consideration provided by Duncan Energy Partners in this dropdown transaction was derived from borrowings under a term loan. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding the debt obligations of Duncan Energy Partners. Generally, the DEP II dropdown transaction documents provide that to the extent that the DEP II Midstream Businesses generate cash sufficient to pay distributions to their partners or members, such cash will be distributed to Enterprise III (a wholly owned by Duncan Energy Partners) and Enterprise GTM (our wholly owned subsidiary) in an amount sufficient to generate an aggregate annualized return on their respective investments of 11.85%. Distributions in excess of this amount will be distributed 98.0% to Enterprise GTM and 2.0% to Enterprise III. The initial annual fixed return amount of 11.85% will be increased by 2.0% each calendar year beginning January 1, 2010. For example, the fixed return in 2010, assuming no other adjustments, would be 102% of 11.85%, or 12.087%. Duncan Energy Partners paid a pro rated cash distribution of $0.1115 per unit on the Class B units with respect to the fourth quarter of 2008. Insurance Matters We participate as a named insured in EPCO’s insurance program, which provides us with property damage, business interruption and other coverages, the scope and amounts of which are customary and sufficient for the nature and extent of our operations. While we believe EPCO maintains adequate insurance coverage on our behalf, insurance will not cover every type of damages or interruption that might occur. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient to reimburse us for our repair costs or lost income. Any event that interrupts the revenues generated by our consolidated operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could reduce our ability to pay distributions to our partners and, accordingly, adversely affect the market price of our common units. For windstorm events such as hurricanes and tropical storms, EPCO’s deductible for onshore physical damage is $10.0 million per storm. For offshore assets, the windstorm deductible is $10.0 million per storm plus a one-time $15.0 million aggregate deductible per policy period. For non-windstorm events, EPCO’s deductible for onshore and offshore physical damage is $5.0 million per occurrence. In meeting the deductible amounts, property damage costs are aggregated for EPCO and its affiliates, including us. Accordingly, our exposure with respect to the deductibles may be equal to or less than the stated amounts depending on whether other EPCO or affiliate assets are also affected by an event. To qualify for business interruption coverage in connection with a windstorm event, covered assets must be out-of-service in excess of 60 days for onshore assets and 75 days for offshore assets. To qualify for business interruption coverage in connection with a non-windstorm event, covered onshore and offshore assets must be out-of-service in excess of 60 days. In the third quarter of 2008, our onshore and offshore facilities located along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana were adversely impacted by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. The disruptions in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production caused by these storms resulted in decreased volumes for some of our pipeline systems, natural gas processing plants, NGL fractionators and offshore platforms, which, in turn, caused a decrease in gross operating margin from these operations. As a result of our allocated share of EPCO’s insurance deductibles for windstorm coverage, we expensed a combined $47.9 million of repair costs for property damage in connection with these two storms. We expect to file property damage insurance claims to the extent repair costs exceed deductible amounts. Due to the recent nature of these storms, we are still evaluating the total cost of repairs and the potential for business interruption claims on certain assets. 86 Table of Contents See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for more information regarding insurance matters.

See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our debt obligations. (2) Our estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principle amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2008. With respect to variable-rate debt, we applied the weighted-average interest rates paid during 2008. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding variable interest rates charged in 2008 under our credit agreements. In addition, our estimate of cash payments for interest gives effect to interest rate swap agreements in place at December 31, 2008. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our estimated cash payments for interest are significantly influenced by the long-term maturities of our $550.0 million Junior Notes A (due August 2066) and $682.7 million Junior Notes B (due January 2068). Our estimated cash payments for interest assume that the Junior Note obligations are not called prior to maturity.

(6) As presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008, other long-term liabilities consist primarily of (i) liabilities for our asset retirement obligations and (ii) liabilities for environmental remediation costs. For information regarding our environmental remediation costs and asset retirement obligations, see Notes 2 and 10 respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations involving operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Except for the following information regarding debt obligations of certain unconsolidated affiliates, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements, as described in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, 87 Table of Contents revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The following information summarizes the significant terms of such unconsolidated debt obligations. Poseidon. At December 31, 2008, Poseidon’s debt obligations consisted of $109.0 million outstanding under its $150.0 million revolving credit facility. Amounts borrowed under this facility mature in May 2011 and are secured by substantially all of Poseidon’s assets. Evangeline. At December 31, 2008, Evangeline’s debt obligations consisted of (i) $8.2 million in principal amount of 9.90% fixed rate Series B senior secured notes due December 2010 and (ii) a $7.5 million subordinated note payable. Duncan Energy Partners had $1.0 million of letters of credit outstanding on December 31, 2008 that were furnished on behalf of Evangeline’s debt. Summary of Related Party Transactions The following table summarizes our related party transactions for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands). For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues from consolidated operations EPCO and affiliates $ 121,201 $ 67,635 $ 98,671 Energy Transfer Equity and subsidiaries 561,727 294,441 -- Unconsolidated affiliates 396,879 290,640 304,559 Total $ 1,079,807 $ 652,716 $ 403,230 Cost of sales EPCO and affiliates $ 59,173 $ 33,827 $ 86,050 Energy Transfer Equity and subsidiaries 173,883 26,889 -- Unconsolidated affiliates 90,836 41,474 42,166 Total $ 323,892 $ 102,190 $ 128,216 Operating costs and expenses EPCO and affiliates $ 314,612 $ 260,716 $ 225,487 Energy Transfer Equity and subsidiaries 18,284 8,267 -- Unconsolidated affiliates (10,388 ) (8,709 ) (10,560 ) Total $ 322,508 $ 260,274 $ 214,927 General and administrative expenses EPCO and affiliates $ 59,058 $ 56,518 $ 41,265 Unconsolidated affiliates (51 ) -- -- Total $ 59,007 $ 56,518 $ 41,265 Other income (expense) EPCO and affiliates $ (274 ) $ (170 ) $ 680 Unconsolidated affiliates -- -- 262 Total $ (274 ) $ (170 ) $ 942 For additional information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. For information regarding certain business relationships and related transactions, see Item 13 of this annual report. We have an extensive and ongoing relationship with EPCO and its affiliates, including TEPPCO. Our revenues from EPCO and affiliates are primarily associated with sales of NGL products. Our expenses with EPCO and affiliates are primarily due to (i) reimbursements we pay EPCO in connection with an administrative services agreement (the “ASA”) and (ii) purchases of NGL products. TEPPCO is an affiliate of ours due to the common control relationship of both entities. Enterprise GP Holdings acquired non-controlling ownership interests in both ETE GP and Energy Transfer Equity in May 2007. As a result of this transaction, ETE GP and Energy Transfer Equity became related parties to us. Many of our unconsolidated affiliates perform supporting or complementary roles to our consolidated business operations. The majority of our revenues from unconsolidated affiliates relate to natural gas sales to a Louisiana affiliate. The majority of our expenses with unconsolidated affiliates 88 Table of Contents pertain to payments we make to K/D/S Promix, L.L.C. for NGL transportation, storage and fractionation services and to Jonah for natural gas purchases. On February 5, 2007, our consolidated subsidiary, Duncan Energy Partners, completed an underwritten initial public offering of its common units. Duncan Energy Partners was formed in September 2006 as a Delaware limited partnership to, among other things, acquire ownership interests in certain of our midstream energy businesses. For additional information regarding Duncan Energy Partners, see “Other Items – Duncan Energy Partners Transactions” within this section.

These subleases are part of the ASA that we executed with EPCO in connection with our formation in 1998. EPCO holds this equipment pursuant to operating leases for which it has retained the corresponding cash lease payment obligation. We record the full value of such lease payments made by EPCO as a non-cash related party operating expense, with the offset to partners’ equity recorded as a general contribution to our partnership. Apart from the partnership interests we granted to EPCO at our formation, EPCO does not receive any additional ownership rights as a result of its contribution to us of the retained leases. We exercised our election under the retained leases to purchase a cogeneration unit in December 2008 for $2.3 million. For additional information regarding the ASA and the retained leases, see Item 13 of this annual report.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We may use financial instruments (e.g., futures, forwards, swaps, options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics) to mitigate the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions. In general, the types of risks we attempt to hedge are those related to (i) the variability of future earnings, (ii) fair values of certain debt obligations and (iii) cash flows resulting from changes in applicable interest rates, commodity prices or exchange rates. We routinely review our outstanding financial instruments in light of current market conditions. If market conditions warrant, some financial instruments may be closed out in advance of their contractual settlement dates thus realizing income or loss depending on the specific hedging criteria. When this occurs, we may enter into a new financial instrument to reestablish the hedge to which the closed instrument relates. The following table presents gains (losses) recorded in net income attributable to our interest rate risk and commodity risk hedging transactions for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands). These amounts do not present the corresponding gains (losses) attributable to the underlying hedged items.

For amounts recorded in net income and other 91 Table of Contents comprehensive income and on our balance sheet related to our consolidated hedging activities, please refer to the preceding tables. Interest Rate Risk Hedging Portfolio Our interest rate exposure results from variable and fixed rate borrowings under various debt agreements. The following information summarizes significant components of our interest rate risk hedging portfolio: Fair value hedges – EPO interest rate swaps We manage a portion of our interest rate exposure by utilizing interest rate swaps and similar arrangements, which allow us to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt or a portion of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt. At December 31, 2008, we had four interest rate swap agreements outstanding having an aggregate notional value of $400.0 million that were accounted for as fair value hedges. The aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps at December 31, 2008, was $46.7 million (an asset), with an offsetting increase in the fair value of the underlying debt. There were eleven interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2007 having an aggregate fair value of $12.9 million (an asset). The following table summarizes our interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2008. Number Period Covered Termination Fixed to Notional Hedged Fixed Rate Debt of Swaps by Swap Date of Swap Variable Rate (1) Value Senior Notes C, 6.375% fixed rate, due Feb. 2013 1 Jan. 2004 to Feb. 2013 Feb. 2013 6.375% to 5.015% $100.0 million Senior Notes G, 5.60% fixed rate, due Oct. 2014 3 4th Qtr. 2004 to Oct. 2014 Oct. 2014 5.60% to 5.297% $300.0 million (1) The variable rate indicated is the all-in variable rate for the current settlement period. We have designated these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges under SFAS 133 since they mitigate changes in the fair value of the underlying fixed rate debt. As effective fair value hedges, an increase in the fair value of these interest rate swaps is equally offset by an increase in the fair value of the underlying hedged debt. The offsetting changes in fair value have no effect on current period interest expense. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap portfolio and the related change in fair value of the underlying debt at the dates indicated (dollars in millions). Swap Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2007 December 31, 2008 February 3, 2009 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset $ 12.9 $ 46.7 $ 36.3 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) (7.4 ) 42.4 31.1 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Asset 33.1 51.1 41.5 The fair value of the interest rate swaps excludes related hedged amounts we have recorded in earnings. The change in fair value between December 31, 2008 and February 3, 2009 is primarily due to an increase in market interest rates relative to the interest rates used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments at December 31, 2008. The underlying floating LIBOR forward interest rate curve used to determine the February 3, 2009 fair values ranged from approximately 1.3% to 3.8% using 6-month reset periods ranging from February 2008 to March 2014. 92 Table of Contents Cash flow hedges – EPO treasury locks We may enter into treasury rate lock transactions (“treasury locks”) to hedge U.S. treasury rates related to its anticipated issuances of debt. Each of our treasury lock transactions was designated as a cash flow hedge. Gains or losses on the termination of such instruments are reclassified into net income (as a component of interest expense) using the effective interest method over the estimated term of the underlying fixed-rate debt. At December 31, 2008, we had no treasury lock financial instruments outstanding. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate notional value of our treasury lock financial instruments was $600.0 million, which had a total fair value (a liability) of $19.6 million. We terminated a number of treasury lock financial instruments during 2008 and 2007. These terminations resulted in realized losses of $40.4 million in 2008 and gains of $48.8 million in 2007. We expect to reclassify $1.6 million of cumulative net gains from our interest rate risk cash flow hedges into net income (as a decrease to interest expense) during 2009. Cash flow hedges – Duncan Energy Partners’ interest rate swaps At December 31, 2008, Duncan Energy Partners had interest rate swap agreements outstanding having an aggregate notional value of $175.0 million. These swaps were accounted for as cash flow hedges. The purpose of these financial instruments is to reduce the sensitivity of Duncan Energy Partners’ earnings to the variable interest rates charged under its revolving credit facility. The aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was a liability of $9.8 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Duncan Energy Partners expects to reclassify $6.0 million of cumulative net losses from its interest rate risk cash flow hedges into net income (as an increase to interest expense) during 2009. The following table summarizes Duncan Energy Partners’ interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2008. Number Period Covered Termination Variable to Notional Hedged Variable Rate Debt of Swaps by Swap Date of Swap Fixed Rate (1) Value DEP I Revolving Credit Facility, due Feb. 2011 3 Sep. 2007 to Sep. 2010 Sep. 2010 1.47% to 4.62% $175.0 million (1) Amounts receivable from or payable to the swap counterparties are settled every three months (the “settlement period”). As cash flow hedges, any increase or decrease in fair value (to the extent effective) would be recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into earnings based on the settlement period hedged. Any ineffectiveness is recorded directly into earnings as an increase in interest expense. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of Duncan Energy Partners’ interest rate swap portfolio (dollars in millions). Swap Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2007 December 31, 2008 February 3, 2009 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Liability $ (3.8 ) $ (9.8 ) $ (9.4 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Liability (2.2 ) (9.4 ) (9.0 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Liability (5.3 ) (10.2 ) (9.8 ) Commodity Risk Hedging Portfolio Our commodity risk hedging portfolio was impacted by a significant decline in natural gas prices during the second half of 2008. As a result of the global recession, commodity prices have continued to be volatile during the first quarter of 2009. We may experience additional losses related to our commodity risk hedging portfolio in 2009. The prices of natural gas, NGLs and certain petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our 93 Table of Contents control. In order to manage the price risks associated with such products, we may enter into commodity financial instruments. The primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to reduce our exposure to price risks associated with (i) natural gas purchases, (ii) the value of NGL production and inventories, (iii) related firm commitments, (iv) fluctuations in transportation revenues where the underlying fees are based on natural gas index prices and (v) certain anticipated transactions involving either natural gas, NGLs or certain petrochemical products. From time to time, we inject natural gas into storage and may utilize hedging instruments to lock in the value of its inventory positions. The commodity financial instruments we utilize are settled in cash. We have segregated our commodity financial instruments portfolio between those financial instruments utilized in connection with our natural gas marketing activities and those used in connection with its NGL and petrochemical operations. A significant number of the financial instruments in this portfolio hedge the purchase of physical natural gas. If natural gas prices fall below the price stipulated in such financial instruments, we recognize a liability for the difference; however, if prices partially or fully recover, this liability would be reduced or eliminated, as appropriate. Our restricted cash balance at December 31, 2008 was $203.8 million in order to meet commodity exchange deposit requirements and the negative change in the fair value of our natural gas hedge positions. Natural gas marketing activities At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the aggregate fair value of those financial instruments utilized in connection with our natural gas marketing activities was an asset of $6.5 million and a liability of $0.3 million, respectively. Almost all of the financial instruments within this portion of the commodity financial instruments portfolio are accounted for using mark-to-market accounting, with a small number accounted for as cash flow hedges. We did not have any cash flow hedges related to our natural gas marketing activities at December 31, 2008. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of this component of the overall portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2007 December 31, 2008 February 3, 2009 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ (0.3 ) $ 6.5 $ 13.9 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (1.4 ) 2.7 9.4 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 0.7 9.9 18.3 The change in fair value of the instruments between December 31, 2008 and February 3, 2009 is primarily due to a decrease in natural gas prices. NGL and petrochemical operations At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the aggregate fair value of those financial instruments utilized in connection with our NGL and petrochemical operations were liabilities of $102.1 million and $19.0 million, respectively. Almost all of the financial instruments within this portion of the commodity financial instruments portfolio are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with a small number accounted for using mark-to-market accounting. We expect to reclassify $114.0 million of cumulative net losses from these cash flow hedges into net income (as an increase in operating costs and expenses) during 2009. We have employed a program to economically hedge a portion of our earnings from natural gas processing in the Rocky Mountain region. This program consists of (i) the forward sale of a portion of our expected equity NGL production volumes at fixed prices through 2009 and (ii) the purchase, using commodity financial instruments, of the amount of natural gas expected to be consumed as plant thermal 94 Table of Contents reduction (“PTR”) in the production of such equity NGL volumes. The objective of this strategy is to hedge a level of gross margins (i.e., NGL sales revenues less actual costs for PTR and the gain or loss on the PTR hedge) associated with the forward sales contracts by fixing the cost of natural gas used for PTR, through the use of commodity financial instruments. At December 31, 2008, this hedging program had hedged future expected gross margins (before plant operating expenses) of $483.9 million on 22.5 million barrels of forecasted NGL forward sales transactions extending through 2009. Our NGL forward sales contracts are not accounted for as financial instruments under SFAS 133 since they meet normal purchase and sale exception criteria; therefore, changes in the aggregate economic value of these sales contracts are not reflected in net income and other comprehensive income until the volumes are delivered to customers. On the other hand, the commodity financial instruments used to purchase the related quantities of PTR (i.e., “PTR hedges”) are accounted for as cash flow hedges; therefore, changes in the aggregate fair value of the PTR hedges are presented in other comprehensive income (loss). Once the forecasted NGL forward sales transactions occur, any realized gains and losses on the cash flow hedges would be reclassified into net income in that period. Prior to actual settlement, if the market price of natural gas is less than the price stipulated in a commodity financial instrument, we recognize an unrealized loss in other comprehensive loss for the excess of the natural gas price stated in the hedge over the market price. To the extent that we realize such financial losses upon settlement of the instrument, the losses are added to the actual cost we pay for PTR, which would then be based on the lower market price. Conversely, if the market price of natural gas is greater than the price stipulated in such hedges, we recognize an unrealized gain in other comprehensive income for the excess of the market price over the natural gas price stated in the PTR hedge. If realized, the gains on the financial instrument would serve to reduce the actual cost paid for PTR, which would then be based on the higher market price. The net effect of these hedging relationships is that our total cost of natural gas used for PTR approximates the amount it originally hedged under this program. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of this component of the overall portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2007 December 31, 2008 February 3, 2009 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Liability $ (19.0 ) $ (102.1 ) $ (111.6 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 11.3 (94.0 ) (109.2 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Liability (49.2 ) (110.1 ) (114.1 ) The change in fair value of the NGL and petrochemical portfolio between December 31, 2008 and February 3, 2009 is primarily due to a decrease in natural gas prices. Foreign Currency Hedging Portfolio We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through a Canadian NGL marketing subsidiary. As a result, we could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. We attempt to hedge this risk using foreign exchange purchase contracts to fix the exchange rate. Mark-to-market accounting is utilized for these contracts, which typically have a duration of one month. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded minimal gains from these financial instruments. In addition, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk through our Japanese Yen Term Loan Agreement (“Yen Term Loan”) that EPO entered into in November 2008. As a result, we could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. We hedged this risk by entering into a foreign exchange purchase contract to fix the exchange rate. This purchase contract was designated as a cash flow hedge. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of this contract was $9.3 million. This contract will be settled in March 2009 upon repayment of the Yen Term Loan. Total interest expense under this loan agreement was $4.0 million, of which $1.7 million is the expected foreign currency loss, which will be recorded as interest expense. 95 Table of Contents Product Purchase Commitments We have long and short-term purchase commitments for NGLs, petrochemicals and natural gas with several suppliers. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. For additional information regarding these commitments, see “Contractual Obligations” included under Item 7 of this annual report. Fair Value Information On January 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 that apply to financial assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at a specified measurement date. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding fair value disclosures pertaining to our financial assets and liabilities. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) primarily includes the effective portion of the gain or loss on financial instruments designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge, foreign currency adjustments and Dixie’s minimum pension liability adjustments. Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) from cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) in which the hedged forecasted transactions (such as a forecasted forward sale of NGLs) affect earnings. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) must be immediately reclassified. The following table presents the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the dates indicated: At December 31, 2008 2007 Commodity financial instruments – cash flow hedges (1) $ (114,077 ) $ (21,619 ) Interest rate financial instruments – cash flow hedges (1) 3,818 34,980 Foreign currency cash flow hedges (1) 10,594 1,308 Foreign currency translation adjustment (2) (1,301 ) 1,200 Pension and postretirement benefit plans (3) (751 ) 588 Total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ (101,717 ) $ 16,457 (1) See Note 7 for additional information regarding these components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

1061219,EPD,ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS PARTNERS L.P.,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and our accompanying notes included in this annual report. Our discussion and analysis includes the following: § Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. § Overview of Business. § Basis of Financial Statement Presentation. § Significant Recent Developments – Discusses significant developments during the year ended December 31, 2009 and through the date of this filing. § General Outlook for 2010. § Results of Operations – Discusses material year-to-year variances in our Statements of Consolidated Operations. § Liquidity and Capital Resources – Addresses available sources of liquidity and capital resources and includes a discussion of our capital spending program. § Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. § Other Items – Includes information related to contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements and other matters. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This discussion contains various forward-looking statements and information that are based on our beliefs and those of our general partner, as well as assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. When used in this document, words such as “anticipate,” “project,” “expect,” “plan,” “seek,” “goal,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “intend,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “believe,” “may,” “potential” and similar expressions and statements regarding our plans and objectives for future operations, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although we and our general partner believe that such expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, neither we nor our general partner can give any assurances that such expectations will prove to be correct. Such statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and assumptions as described in more detail in Item 1A of this annual report. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, projected or expected. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in the annual report speak only as of the date hereof. Except as required by federal and state securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or any other reason. Overview of Business We are a North American midstream energy company providing a wide range of services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemicals. Our midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the United States, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and 69 Table of Contents international markets. In addition, we are an industry leader in the development of pipeline and other midstream energy infrastructure in the continental United States and Gulf of Mexico. We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 1998, the common units of which are listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “EPD.” We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO. We are owned 98% by our limited partners and 2% by our general partner, EPGP. EPGP is owned 100% by Enterprise GP Holdings. In connection with the TEPPCO Merger, we revised our business segments. Our reorganized business segments reflect the manner in which these businesses are managed and reviewed by the chief executive officer of our general partner. Under our new business segment structure, we have five reportable business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services; (ii) Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services; (iii) Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services; (iv) Offshore Pipelines & Services; and (v) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the type of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. Basis of Financial Statement Presentation Since Enterprise Products Partners, TEPPCO and TEPPCO GP are under common control of EPCO and its affiliates, the TEPPCO Merger was accounted for at historical costs as a reorganization of entities under common control in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. The inclusion of TEPPCO and TEPPCO GP in our consolidated financial statements was effective January 1, 2005 because an affiliate of EPCO under common control with Enterprise Products Partners originally acquired ownership interests in TEPPCO GP in February 2005. Our consolidated financial statements prior to the TEPPCO Merger reflect the combined financial information of Enterprise Products Partners, TEPPCO and TEPPCO GP on a 100% basis. Third-party and related party ownership interests in TEPPCO and TEPPCO GP are reflected as “Former owners of TEPPCO,” a component of noncontrolling interest. The financial statements of TEPPCO and TEPPCO GP were prepared from the separate accounting records maintained by TEPPCO and TEPPCO GP. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. There was no change in net income attributable to Enterprise Products Partners L.P. for periods prior to the merger since net income attributable to TEPPCO and TEPPCO GP was allocated to noncontrolling interests. Additionally, there was no change in our reported earnings per unit for such periods. See “Other Items” included within this Item 7 for information regarding total segment gross operating margin, which is a non-generally accepted accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measure of segment performance. 70 Table of Contents The following information is provided to reconcile total revenues and total gross operating margin for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, as currently presented, with those we previously presented (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Total revenues, as previously reported $ 21,905.6 $ 16,950.1 Revenues from TEPPCO 13,532.9 9,658.1 Revenues from Jonah Gas Gathering Company (“Jonah”) (1) 232.8 204.1 Eliminations (2) (201.7 ) (98.5 ) Total revenues, as currently reported $ 35,469.6 $ 26,713.8 Total segment gross operating margin, as previously reported $ 2,057.4 $ 1,492.1 Gross operating margin from TEPPCO 501.0 434.8 Gross operating margin from Jonah 157.6 125.4 Eliminations (3) (107.0 ) (87.9 ) Total segment gross operating margin, as currently reported $ 2,609.0 $ 1,964.4 (1) Prior to the TEPPCO Merger, we and TEPPCO were joint venture partners in Jonah.

(3) Represents equity earnings from Jonah recorded by Enterprise Products Partners and TEPPCO prior to the merger. Significant Recent Developments Merger of TEPPCO and TEPPCO GP with Enterprise Products Partners On October 26, 2009, the related mergers of our wholly owned subsidiaries with TEPPCO and TEPPCO GP were completed. Under terms of the merger agreements, TEPPCO and TEPPCO GP became wholly owned subsidiaries of ours and each of TEPPCO's unitholders, except for a privately held affiliate of EPCO, were entitled to receive 1.24 of our common units for each TEPPCO unit. In total, we issued an aggregate of 126,932,318 common units and 4,520,431 Class B units (described below) as consideration in the TEPPCO Merger for both TEPPCO units and the TEPPCO GP membership interests. TEPPCO’s units, which had been trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “TPP,” have been delisted and are no longer publicly traded. On October 27, 2009, our TEPPCO and TEPPCO GP equity interests were contributed to EPO, and TEPPCO and TEPPCO GP became wholly owned subsidiaries of EPO. A privately held affiliate of EPCO exchanged a portion of its TEPPCO units, based on the 1.24 exchange rate, for 4,520,431 of our Class B units in lieu of common units. The Class B units are not entitled to regular quarterly cash distributions for the first sixteen quarters following the closing date of the merger. The Class B units automatically convert into the same number of common units on the date immediately following the payment date for the sixteenth quarterly distribution following the closing date of the merger. The Class B units are entitled to vote together with the common units as a single class on partnership matters and, except for the payment of distributions, have the same rights and privileges as our common units. In connection with the TEPPCO Merger, EPO commenced offers in September 2009 to exchange all of TEPPCO’s outstanding notes (a combined principal amount of $2 billion) for a corresponding series of new EPO notes. The purpose of the exchange offer was to simplify our capital structure following the TEPPCO Merger. The exchanges for tendered TEPPCO notes were completed on October 27, 2009. The new EPO notes are guaranteed by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. The EPO notes issued in the exchange were recorded at the same carrying value as the TEPPCO notes being replaced. Accordingly, we recognized no gain or loss for accounting purposes related to this exchange. All note exchange direct costs paid to third parties have been expensed. In addition to the debt exchange, we gained approval from the requisite TEPPCO noteholders to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and reporting requirements associated with the remaining TEPPCO notes. Upon the consummation of the TEPPCO Merger, EPO repaid and terminated indebtedness under TEPPCO’s revolving credit facility. 71 Table of Contents Enterprise Products Partners and Duncan Energy Partners Announce Extension of Acadian Gas System into Haynesville Shale Supply Basin In October 2009, we and our affiliate, Duncan Energy Partners, announced plans for our jointly owned Acadian Gas System to extend its Louisiana intrastate natural gas pipeline system into northwest Louisiana to provide producers in the rapidly expanding Haynesville Shale natural gas supply basin with access to additional markets through connections with the Acadian Gas System in south Louisiana and nine major interstate natural gas pipelines (“Haynesville Extension”). The Haynesville Shale producing area is believed to cover approximately 2 million acres in northwest Louisiana, almost all of which is under lease. Production from the approximately 200 wells drilled to date is estimated at more than 1 Bcf/d. Over 400 locations are in various stages of drilling and completion with approximately 150 rigs now working in the region. As currently designed, the Haynesville Extension will have the potential capacity to transport up to 2.1 Bcf/d of natural gas from the Haynesville area through a 249-mile pipeline that will connect with the existing Acadian Gas System. The pipeline is expected to be in service during the third quarter of 2011. The Acadian Gas System serves major natural gas markets along the Mississippi River corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans and has the ability to make physical deliveries into the Henry Hub. The Haynesville Extension will also have interconnects with major interstate pipelines including Florida Gas, Texas Eastern, Transco, Sonat, Columbia Gulf, Trunkline, ANR, Tennessee Gas and Texas Gas. Together with the capacity of the existing Acadian Gas System, the extension project will provide approximately 6.2 Bcf/d of redelivery capacity into an estimated 12 Bcf/d of available downstream pipeline takeaway capacity. Initially, the project will connect to nine Haynesville Shale producer locations in DeSoto and Red River parishes. Along with providing much needed natural gas takeaway capacity for growing Haynesville production, the Haynesville Extension is expected to provide shippers the opportunity to benefit from additional pricing points and diverse service options and access to the south Louisiana marketplace. For producers, the more flexible contracting options associated with an intrastate pipeline environment is expected to help facilitate a seamless transaction for the producer from the field to the end user. Currently, Duncan Energy Partners owns a 66% equity interest in the entities that own the Acadian Gas System, with EPO owning the remaining 34% equity interest. Duncan Energy Partners and EPO are in discussions regarding the funding and related aspects of the Haynesville Extension project. Enterprise Products Partners and TEPPCO Exit Texas Offshore Port System Partnership In August 2008, our wholly owned subsidiaries together with Oiltanking formed TOPS. Effective April 16, 2009, our wholly owned subsidiaries dissociated (exited) from TOPS. As a result, operating costs and expenses and net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflect a non-cash charge of $68.4 million. This loss represented the forfeiture of our cumulative investment in TOPS through the date of dissociation and reflected our capital contributions to TOPS for construction in progress amounts. On September 17, 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with certain affiliates of Oiltanking that resolved all disputes between the parties related to the business and affairs of the TOPS project. We recognized an additional $66.9 million of expense during 2009 in connection with the payment of this cash settlement. The aggregate $135.3 million of charges recorded during 2009 were classified within the Offshore Pipelines & Services business segment. 72 Table of Contents General Outlook for 2010 Commercial Outlook We provide midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemicals. Factors that can affect the demand for our services include global and U.S. economic conditions, the demand for energy, the market price of energy, the cost to develop natural gas and crude oil reserves in the U.S. and the cost and availability of capital to energy companies to invest in drilling activities. The global economic contraction that began in late 2007 appeared to show signs of stabilizing in the second half of 2009 with most of the twenty largest developed economies (“G20”) reporting quarter-over-quarter growth in real gross domestic product (“GDP”) beginning in the third quarter of 2009. However, approximately 65% of the G20 were still reporting year-over-year contraction in real GDP in 2009. The United States reported quarter-over-quarter real GDP growth of 2.2% and 5.7% for the third and fourth quarters of 2009, respectively, after five quarters of contraction in real GDP since the beginning of 2008. Real GDP growth for 2009 compared to 2008 was 0.1%. Impacted by general economic conditions and price shock-induced conservation by consumers, U.S. demand for petroleum products and natural gas (as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration) for the first ten months of 2009 decreased approximately 5.4% and 2.1%, respectively, from the same periods in 2008 and by approximately 11% and 1.5%, respectively, from the first ten months of 2007. Likewise, U.S. demand for petroleum products for transportation purposes (e.g., motor gasoline, distillate and jet fuel) for the first ten months of 2009 declined by 2.7% and 6.3% compared to the first ten months of 2008 and 2007, respectively. The rate of decline in U.S. demand for petroleum products since mid-2009 appears to be moderating and demand for natural gas since mid-2009 has increased by 1.5% compared to the same period in 2008. Energy prices have generally rebounded with the recovery in demand, economic growth and stability in the capital markets. The average prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Mont Belvieu ethane for December 2009 increased by approximately 82% and 120%, respectively, from December 2008; while natural gas at the Henry Hub in December 2009 decreased by 8% from December 2008. Notably, there has been a substantial change in the price relationship between natural gas and crude oil. In December 2008, natural gas was priced at 81% of crude oil on an energy equivalent basis compared to 41% in December 2009. We believe changes in the price relationships of crude oil and crude oil derivatives to natural gas and NGLs in the past year could lead to a long-term structural change in feedstock selection by the petrochemical industry. During 2009 and the beginning of 2010, natural gas and NGLs have a significant price advantage over more costly crude oil and crude oil derivatives (such as naphtha). This has been primarily driven by (i) a decline in global crude oil production; (ii) more government-held acreage being off limits to non-sovereign energy companies; (iii) geopolitical risk; (iv) growing demand for crude oil by China and other developing countries; (v) the globalization of natural gas prices with more LNG facilities becoming operational; and (vi) the technological breakthroughs around the development of natural gas shale resource basins that have decreased finding and development costs. For ethylene producers, the largest consumers of NGLs, this has meant that ethane and propane were their most consistently profitable feedstocks in 2009 and are forecasted to be so in 2010. This feedstock cost advantage and a weak U.S. dollar provided U.S. ethylene producers with a competitive advantage globally, especially relative to naphtha crackers in Europe and Asia. Per industry publications, approximately 24% of 2009 aggregate domestic production of high density polyethylene (“HDPE”), low density polyethylene (“LDPE”) and polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) were for the export market. U.S. ethylene producers responded by maximizing the use of NGLs as a feedstock, rationalizing some of their facilities and investing capital to modify their furnaces to crack more NGLs. The U.S. ethylene industry consumed almost 1.3 MMBbls/d of NGL feedstocks in December 2009, an 81% increase 73 Table of Contents over 700 MBPD of NGLs consumed in December 2008. We estimate domestic crackers are in the process of adding approximately 100 MBPD of new capacity to crack ethane and propane through modifications to their existing facilities. Certain international ethylene crackers have reacted to the NGL feedstock cost advantage by importing propane to displace crude oil derivatives to feed their heavy crackers, including propane produced in the U.S. Export ethylene derivative demand remains strong in early 2010, but is expected to moderate as Middle East production increases later this year. Chemical margins in the U.S. are also forecasted to compress due to increased competition, but overall demand for domestically produced ethylene is expected to decline only by approximately 1.5% to 48.3 billion lbs/year in 2010 and then increase 2.3% to 49.4 billion lbs/year in 2011. With the global recession abating, domestic demand is expected to increase, consuming the production that was sold into the export markets in 2008 and 2009. Strong end user demand for NGLs and increases in NGL-rich natural gas production are expected to (i) keep our natural gas processing plants and NGL fractionators, pipelines and storage facilities operating at high utilization rates; (ii) provide attractive natural gas processing margins for our equity NGL production; and (iii) provide us with opportunities to invest capital to build new natural gas processing, NGL fractionation and pipeline facilities. At the beginning of 2009, we had opportunities to purchase NGLs and sell them forward for delivery in late 2009 and early 2010 at attractive sales margins. To facilitate this activity, we utilized our NGL storage facilities and pipelines. At the beginning of 2010, these opportunities have largely diminished. Natural gas prices have significantly declined from a peak of over $13.00 per MMBtu in mid-2008 to $5.35 per MMBtu in December 2009. This price decrease coupled with the residual impact of a higher cost of capital for certain energy companies has generally resulted in energy companies reducing their drilling capital expenditure budgets. This has led to a substantial decrease in the number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S., declining from a peak of 1,606 rigs in August 2008 to a low of 665 rigs in July 2009 as natural gas prices approached a low of $1.88 per MMBtu in September 2009. The natural gas rig count has since rebounded to 878 rigs at the beginning of February 2010. Even though the total natural gas rig count has dropped by almost half, the substantial efficiencies of horizontal drilling in the non-conventional and shale supply basins have allowed producers to maintain overall natural gas deliverability. As a result, rig count is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the level of future natural gas production. The rig count has increased in the developing Haynesville Shale, Marcellus Shale and Eagle Ford Shale area where producers are drilling to hold recently executed leases. Generally, rig counts remain significantly below peak levels in areas with conventional natural gas reserves and areas where producers have leases held by production. Certain of the large natural gas and NGL producing basins we serve have seen a significant decrease in rig count. In Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico, rig counts at the end of 2009 had declined 52%, 66% and 49%, respectively, from peak levels during 2008. Given the number of wells waiting to be connected to our pipeline systems, the respective production decline curves and the decline in drilling activity, we believe the aggregate natural gas pipeline volumes transported on our Jonah Gas Gathering, Piceance Basin Gathering and San Juan Gathering systems for 2010 could range from an increase of 5% to a decrease of 5% compared to volumes transported in 2009. Since the end of 2009, the rig counts in Wyoming and New Mexico have increased by 14% and 12%, respectively. These areas have substantial, undeveloped non-conventional natural gas reserves with some of the lowest finding costs in the U.S. and are supported by existing pipeline infrastructure to transport the natural gas to market. We believe as U.S. natural gas supply and demand becomes more balanced and natural gas prices become less volatile these areas will have an increase in drilling activity to support, and potentially increase, current production levels. In Texas, the rig count at the end of 2009 was 50% below peak levels during 2008. Since the end of 2009, the rig count in Texas has increased 13%. The rig count in the Barnett Shale area at the end of 2009 was approximately 55% below peak levels. While the Barnett Shale has a significant amount of 74 Table of Contents undeveloped natural gas reserves at relatively low finding costs, much of the acreage under lease is held by production. Certain energy companies that were active in the Barnett Shale have elected to reallocate a portion of their capital resources in the near term to drill wells in the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana, the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas to secure recently acquired leases that are not held by production. Despite the lower rig count in the Barnett Shale and certain other areas of Texas, we expect transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System to increase by up to 10% in 2010 with volume growth principally attributable to a full year of operations for the Sherman Extension pipeline and the commencement of operations on the Trinity River Lateral during the third quarter of 2010. Both of these pipelines serve the Barnett Shale region. South Texas has seen an increase in drilling activity attributable to the development of the Eagle Ford Shale, which runs parallel to the Texas Gulf Coast and adjacent to our Texas Intrastate System. We have completed several small pipeline projects that enable us to gather, transport and process up to 300 MMcf/d of new natural gas production from the Eagle Ford Shale. Generally, energy companies have had early success in the Eagle Ford Shale and several have indicated they plan to accelerate their drilling programs. Production associated with this region includes crude oil, NGL-rich natural gas and lean natural gas. We believe there may be opportunities for us to invest capital to incrementally expand our natural gas pipeline, storage and processing facilities; NGL pipeline and fractionation facilities; and crude oil pipeline and storage facilities to facilitate production growth from this region. The rig count in Louisiana has increased 14% since the end of 2008 primarily due to development activities in the Haynesville Shale area of northwest Louisiana. Based on industry success, natural gas production from this region is expected to grow rapidly over the next several years. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we announced that seven energy companies had executed long-term agreements to support the Haynesville Extension expansion of our Acadian Gas System. The Haynesville Extension is a 249-mile, 42-inch pipeline designed to transport up to 2.1 Bcf/d. Construction of the pipeline will begin in 2010 and is scheduled to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2011. With respect to our offshore Gulf of Mexico assets, we expect natural gas volumes handled by our Independence Hub platform and Trail pipeline to range from 700 BBtus/d to 800 BBtus/d. Our major crude oil pipelines are expected to transport up to an aggregate 20% increase in volumes as the result of a full year of operations from our Shenzi pipeline and additional volumes from many offshore production facilities that were either idle or in limited service for at least half of 2009 due to repairs to infrastructure damaged by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. Our refined products pipeline generally serves the Petroleum Administration for Defense District (“PADD”) 2 of the U.S. Demand for refined products in this region for 2009 decreased by approximately 8% and 19% from 2008 and 2007, respectively. Commensurately, refined products transportation volumes on our pipelines in 2009 declined by 6.7% and 15.3% compared to 2008 and 2007, respectively. We do not expect any significant improvement in refined product demand in 2010 in this region due to soft economic conditions and ongoing conservation. We completed the TEPPCO Merger on October 26, 2009. Our commercial, engineering and operating teams have had early success in identifying opportunities to increase revenues and/or lower operating costs by incorporating the former TEPPCO assets into our integrated midstream system. We believe we will find additional opportunities in 2010. Liquidity Outlook The debt and equity capital markets have significantly improved since the beginning of 2009. The cost of our term debt and equity capital has generally declined to pre-financial crisis levels. The availability of term debt and equity capital has also improved. The availability of credit commitments from most banks has also improved from a year ago; however, the cost of new bank debt is significantly higher than pre-crisis levels (by approximately 2% on borrowed money) and the term of bank capital is generally limited to no more than three years. 75 Table of Contents In January 2010, we completed a public offering of 10,925,000 of our common units, which resulted in net proceeds of $343.1 million. Upon completion of that offering, we had liquidity, unrestricted cash and capacity under our multi-year credit facility, of approximately $2 billion. Based on information currently available, we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2010 will approximate $1.75 billion, which includes approximately $1.5 billion for growth capital projects and $250 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditures in 2010 are expected to be higher than prior years primarily due to pipeline integrity projects on certain of our pipelines. We estimate sustaining capital expenditures for 2011 will be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. In 2010, we have two notes maturing totaling $554.0 million. A $54.0 million 8.70% note matured on March 1, 2010, and a $500.0 million 4.95% senior note matures on June 1, 2010. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity and access to capital markets to refinance these maturities. We expect our proactive approach to funding capital spending and other partnership needs, combined with sufficient trade credit to operate our businesses efficiently, and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, to provide us with a foundation to meet our anticipated liquidity and capital requirements in 2010. We also believe we will be able to access the capital markets in 2010 to maintain financial flexibility. Based on information currently available to us, we believe we will maintain our investment grade credit ratings and meet our loan covenant obligations in 2010. We have approximately $3.2 billion of senior notes maturing in the period beginning 2010 through the end of 2013. In addition, we have a $282.3 million bank term loan and bank credit facilities with commitments totaling approximately $2.0 billion maturing during this time period. The U.S. government is expected to run substantial annual budget deficits, exceeding a trillion dollars that will require a corresponding issuance of debt by the U.S. Treasury from 2010 through 2013. The interest rate on U.S. Treasury debt has a direct impact on the cost of our debt. At this time, we are uncertain what the impact of the large issuance of U.S. Treasury debt and the prevailing economic and capital market conditions will have on the cost and availability of capital. To date, we have executed approximately $550.0 million of interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our future debt issuance costs to refinance our debt that matures during the 2010 through 2013 time period. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the condition of the capital market and interest rate risk with respect to refinancing these maturities and funding our capital expenditures. 76 Table of Contents Results of Operations Selected Price and Volumetric Data The following table illustrates selected annual and quarterly industry index prices for natural gas, crude oil and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods presented: Polymer Refinery Natural Normal Natural Grade Grade Gas, Crude Oil, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Gasoline, Propylene, Propylene, $/MMBtu $/barrel $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/pound $/pound (1) (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) 2007 Averages $6.86 $72.24 $0.79 $1.21 $1.42 $1.49 $1.68 $0.52 $0.47 2008 1st Quarter $8.03 $97.82 $1.01 $1.47 $1.80 $1.87 $2.12 $0.61 $0.54 2nd Quarter $10.94 $123.80 $1.05 $1.70 $2.05 $2.08 $2.64 $0.70 $0.67 3rd Quarter $10.25 $118.22 $1.09 $1.68 $1.97 $1.99 $2.52 $0.78 $0.66 4th Quarter $6.95 $59.08 $0.42 $0.80 $0.90 $0.96 $1.09 $0.37 $0.22 2008 Averages $9.04 $99.73 $0.89 $1.41 $1.68 $1.72 $2.09 $0.62 $0.52 2009 1st Quarter $4.91 $43.31 $0.36 $0.68 $0.87 $0.97 $0.96 $0.26 $0.20 2nd Quarter $3.51 $59.79 $0.43 $0.73 $0.93 $1.11 $1.21 $0.34 $0.28 3rd Quarter $3.39 $68.24 $0.47 $0.87 $1.12 $1.19 $1.42 $0.48 $0.43 4th Quarter $4.16 $76.19 $0.67 $1.09 $1.39 $1.49 $1.64 $0.50 $0.44 2009 Averages $3.99 $61.88 $0.48 $0.84 $1.08 $1.19 $1.31 $0.39 $0.34 (1) Natural gas, NGL, polymer grade propylene and refinery grade propylene prices represent an average of various commercial index prices including Oil Price Information Service and Chemical Marketing Associates, Inc.

During 2009, our largest non-affiliated customer based on revenues was Shell, which accounted for 9.8% of our revenues. During 2008 and 2007, our largest non-affiliated customer based on revenues was Valero, which accounted for 11.2% and 8.9%, respectively, of our revenues. Comparison of 2009 with 2008 Revenues for 2009 were $25.51 billion compared to $35.47 billion for 2008. The $9.96 billion year-to-year decrease in consolidated revenues is primarily due to lower energy commodity sales prices during 2009 relative to 2008. This factor accounted for a $10.01 billion year-to-year decrease in consolidated revenues associated with our NGL, natural gas, crude oil, petrochemical and refined products 79 Table of Contents marketing activities. Collectively, the remainder of our consolidated revenues increased $47.9 million year-to-year primarily due to improved results from our offshore activities. Revenues from our Offshore Pipelines & Services business segment for 2009 include aggregate property damage and business interruption insurance proceeds of $31.0 million. Operating costs and expenses were $23.57 billion for 2009 compared to $33.62 billion for 2008, a $10.05 billion year-to-year decrease. The cost of sales of our marketing activities decreased $9.59 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower energy commodity sales prices. Likewise, the operating costs and expenses of our natural gas processing plants decreased $700.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower plant thermal reduction (“PTR”) costs attributable to the decline in energy commodity prices. Consolidated operating costs and expenses for 2009 include $68.4 million of expenses related to the forfeiture of our interest in TOPS and $66.9 million of expenses related to the settlement of litigation involving TOPS. Collectively, the remainder of our consolidated operating costs and expenses increased $105.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher depreciation expense and non-cash impairment charges recorded during 2009. General and administrative costs increased $35.1 million year-to-year primarily due to expenses we incurred during 2009 in connection with the TEPPCO Merger. Changes in our revenues and costs and expenses year-to-year are primarily explained by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.85 per gallon during 2009 versus $1.40 per gallon during 2008 – a 39% decrease year-to-year. Our determination of the weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs is based on U.S. Gulf Coast prices for such products at Mont Belvieu, Texas, which is the primary industry hub for domestic NGL production. The market price of natural gas (as measured at Henry Hub in Louisiana) averaged $3.99 per MMBtu during 2009 versus $9.04 per MMBtu during 2008 – a 56% decrease year-to-year. The market price of crude oil (as measured on the NYMEX) averaged $61.88 per barrel during 2009 compared to $99.73 per barrel during 2008 – a 38% decrease year-to-year. See “Selected Price and Volumetric Data” included within this Item 7 for additional historical energy commodity pricing information. Equity in income of our unconsolidated affiliates was $51.2 million for 2009 compared to $34.9 million for 2008, a $16.3 million year-to-year increase. Collectively, equity in income from our investments in Cameron Highway and Poseidon increased $13.8 million year-to-year due to higher crude oil transportation volumes. Equity in income from our investments in White River Hub, LLC (“White River Hub”) and Skelly-Belvieu increased $3.1 million and $1.9 million year-to-year, respectively. The assets owned by White River Hub began commercial operations in December 2008. We acquired a 49% equity interest in Skelly-Belvieu during December 2008. Equity in income from our Marco Polo platform decreased $13.3 million year-to-year primarily due to the expiration of demand fee revenues during March 2009. The Marco Polo platform is owned through our investment in Deepwater Gateway. Collectively, equity in income of our other investments increased $10.8 million year-to-year largely due to improved results from our investments in south Louisiana. Operating income for 2009 was $1.82 billion compared to $1.75 billion for 2008. Collectively, the aforementioned changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates contributed to the $75.6 million year-to-year increase in operating income. Interest expense increased to $641.8 million for 2009 from $540.7 million for 2008. The $101.1 million year-to-year increase in interest expense is primarily due to our issuance of Senior Notes M and N in the second quarter of 2008, Senior Notes O in the fourth quarter of 2008 and a $37.6 million decrease in capitalized interest during 2009 relative to 2008. Average debt principal outstanding increased to $11.92 billion during 2009 from $10.17 billion during 2008 primarily due to debt incurred to fund growth capital investments. Provision for income taxes decreased $5.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower expenses associated with the Texas Margin Tax, partially offset by a one-time charge of $6.6 million associated with taxable gains arising from Dixie Pipeline Company’s (“Dixie”) sale of certain assets during 2009. 80 Table of Contents As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, our consolidated net income decreased $33.8 million year-to-year to $1.16 billion for 2009 compared to $1.19 billion for 2008. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $124.2 million for 2009 compared to $234.9 million for 2008. Such amounts reflect $66.5 million and $193.6 million of net income for 2009 and 2008, respectively, attributable to former owners of TEPPCO. Net income attributable to Enterprise Products Partners increased $76.9 million year-to-year to $1.03 billion for 2009 compared to $954.0 million for 2008. In general, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike had an adverse effect across our operations in the Gulf of Mexico and along the U.S. Gulf Coast during 2008. Storm-related disruptions in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production in these regions resulted in reduced volumes available to our pipeline systems, natural gas processing plants, NGL fractionators and offshore platforms, which in turn caused a decrease in gross operating margin for certain operations. In addition, property damage caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike resulted in lower revenues due to facility downtime as well as higher operating costs and expenses at certain of our plants and pipelines. As a result of our allocated share of EPCO’s insurance deductibles for windstorm coverage, gross operating margin for 2008 includes $49.1 million of repair expenses for property damage sustained by our assets as a result of the hurricanes. We estimate that gross operating margin was reduced by approximately $81.0 million during 2008 due to the effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike as a result of supply interruptions and facility downtime. For more information regarding our insurance program and claims related to these storms, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $1.63 billion for 2009 compared to $1.33 billion for 2008, a $303.7 million year-to-year increase. Results for 2009 include $4.4 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims compared to $1.1 million of proceeds for 2008. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding the effect of cash proceeds from business interruption insurance. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business was $948.8 million for 2009 compared to $815.3 million for 2008, a $133.5 million year-to-year increase. Equity NGL production increased to 117 MBPD during 2009 from 108 MBPD during 2008. The recently completed Meeker and Pioneer facilities and related hedging program contributed $104.7 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin due to higher volumes and improved processing margins. These Rocky Mountain natural gas processing plants produced 60 MBPD of equity NGLs during 2009 compared to 49 MBPD during 2008. During 2009, we significantly increased the volume of forward sales transactions in connection with our NGL marketing activities resulting in higher sales margins and increased utilization of certain of our pipeline and storage facilities. Our NGL marketing activities contributed $95.7 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of this business decreased $66.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower NGL sales margins and equity NGL production volumes in Texas and New Mexico. Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage business was $539.5 million for 2009 compared to $397.4 million for 2008, a $142.1 million year-to-year increase. Total NGL transportation volumes increased to 2,196 MBPD during 2009 from 2,021 MBPD during 2008. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America and Seminole Pipeline Systems increased $85.7 million year-to-year due to a $26.4 million benefit in 2009 related to the Mid-America Pipeline System rate case settlement, an increase in the system-wide tariff, higher volumes and lower fuel costs. Gross operating margin from our NGL import/export terminal and related pipeline increased $20.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher export volumes. Our Mont Belvieu storage complex contributed $14.9 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin due to higher volumes and fees. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our NGL pipelines and related storage assets increased $21.2 million year-to-year primarily due to improved results from our south Louisiana assets. 81 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our NGL fractionation business was $136.0 million for 2009 compared to $111.2 million for 2008.

The EPO notes issued in the exchange were recorded at the same carrying value as the TEPPCO notes being replaced. These notes were issued under a Form S-4 registration statement. During 2008, Duncan Energy Partners filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows it to issue up to $1 billion of debt and equity securities. In 2009, Duncan Energy Partners completed an offering of 8,943,400 of its common units, which generated net cash proceeds of approximately $137.4 million. Duncan Energy Partners used the aggregate net cash proceeds from this 88 Table of Contents offering to repurchase an equal number of its common units that were beneficially owned by EPO. Duncan Energy Partners subsequently cancelled the common units it repurchased from EPO. At December 31, 2009, Duncan Energy Partners can issue approximately $856.4 million of additional equity or debt securities under its registration statement. We have filed registration statements with the SEC authorizing the issuance of up to an aggregate 40,000,000 common units in connection with our distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”). The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they would otherwise receive into the purchase of additional common units of our partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we issued 11,909,083 common units in connection with our DRIP, which generated proceeds of $286.2 million from plan participants. Affiliates of EPCO reinvested $246.3 million in connection with the DRIP during the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, we have a registration statement on file related to our employee unit purchase plan, under which we can issue up to 1,200,000 common units. Under this plan, employees of EPCO can purchase our common units at a 10% discount through payroll deductions. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we issued 180,837 common units to employees under this plan, which generated proceeds of $4.6 million. For information regarding our public debt obligations or partnership equity, see Notes 12 and 13, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Letter of Credit Facilities At December 31, 2009, EPO had outstanding a $50.0 million letter of credit related to its commodity derivative instruments and a $58.3 million letter of credit related to its Petal GO Zone Bonds. These letter of credit facilities do not reduce the amount available for borrowing under EPO’s credit facilities. Credit Ratings At March 1, 2010, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s senior unsecured debt securities remain unchanged from December 31, 2009 at Baa3 by Moody’s Investor Services; BBB- by Fitch Ratings; and BBB- by Standard and Poor’s. Such ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it determines that the circumstances warrant such a change and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Based on the characteristics of the $1.53 billion of fixed/floating unsecured junior subordinated notes, the rating agencies assigned partial equity treatment to the notes. Moody’s Investor Services and Standard and Poor’s each assigned 50% equity treatment and Fitch Ratings assigned 75% equity treatment. A downgrade of our credit ratings could result in our being required to post financial collateral up to the amount of our guaranty of indebtedness of our Centennial joint venture, which was $60.0 million at December 31, 2009. Furthermore, from time to time we enter into contracts in connection with our commodity and interest rate hedging activities that may require the posting of financial collateral, which may be substantial, if our credit were to be downgraded below investment grade. 89 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (dollars in millions). For information regarding the individual components of our cash flow amounts, see the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Item 8 of this annual report. For Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 2,377.2 $ 1,567.1 $ 1,953.6 Cash used in investing activities 1,546.9 3,246.9 2,871.8 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities (837.1 ) 1,690.7 946.3 Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our business activities. As a result, these cash flows are exposed to certain risks. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry. We provide services for producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemicals. The products that we process, sell or transport are principally used as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating; as feedstock in petrochemical manufacturing; and in the production of motor gasoline. Reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers, whether because of a decline in general economic conditions, reduced demand for the end products made with our products, or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons, could have a negative impact on our earnings and operating cash flows. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this annual report. Our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method. The indirect method derives net cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income to remove (i) the effects of all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments, such as changes during the period in inventory, deferred income and similar transactions, (ii) the effects of all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and cash payments, such as changes during the period in receivables and payables, (iii) other non-cash amounts such as depreciation, amortization, operating lease expenses paid by EPCO, changes in the fair market value of derivative instruments and equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates (net cash flows provided by operating activities reflect the actual cash distributions we receive from such investees), and (iv) the effects of all items classified as investing or financing cash flows, such as proceeds from asset sales and related transactions or extinguishment of debt. In general, the net effect of changes in operating accounts results from the timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for purchases and other expenses during each period. Increases or decreases in inventory are influenced by the quantity of products held in connection with our marketing activities and changes in energy commodity prices. Cash used in investing activities primarily represents expenditures for additions to property, plant and equipment, business combinations and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Cash provided by financing activities generally consists of borrowings and repayments of debt, distributions to partners and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities. Amounts presented in our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for borrowings and repayments under debt agreements are influenced by the magnitude of cash receipts and payments under our revolving credit facilities. 90 Table of Contents The following information highlights the significant year-to-year variances in our cash flow amounts: Comparison of 2009 with 2008 Operating Activities. The $810.1 million increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following: § Net cash flows from consolidated operations (excluding distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates, cash payments for interest and cash payments for income taxes) increased $908.8 million year-to-year. The increase in operating cash flow is generally due to increased profitability and the timing of related cash receipts and disbursements. The total year-to-year increase also reflects a $68.9 million increase in operating cash proceeds we received from insurance claims related to certain named storms. For information regarding cash proceeds from business interruption and property damage claims, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Cash payments for interest increased $81.8 million year-to-year primarily due to increased borrowings to finance our capital spending program. Our average debt principal outstanding for 2009 was $11.92 billion compared to $10.17 billion for 2008. § Cash payments for income taxes increased $22.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher payments made for the Texas Margin tax and a taxable gain incurred in 2009 arising from Dixie’s sale of certain assets. Investing Activities. The $1.7 billion decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: § Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs, decreased $945.9 million year-to-year. For additional information related to our capital spending program, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. § Cash used for business combinations decreased $446.2 million year-to-year. Our 2009 business combinations primarily consisted of the acquisition of certain rail and truck terminal facilities located in Mont Belvieu, Texas, a pipeline system in Texas, and the acquisition of tow boats and tank barges primarily based in Miami, Florida, with additional assets located in Mobile, Alabama and Houston, Texas. In 2008, our most significant business combinations consisted of our acquisition of marine transportation businesses. In addition, during 2008 we acquired 100% of the membership interest in Great Divide Gathering LLC (“Great Divide”) and additional interests in consolidated subsidiaries. For additional information regarding our business combinations, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Restricted cash related to our hedging activities decreased $140.2 million (a cash inflow) during 2009 primarily due to the reduction of margin requirements related to derivative instruments we utilized. For 2008, restricted cash related to our hedging activities increased $132.8 million (a cash outflow). See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our interest rate and commodity risk hedging portfolios. 91 Table of Contents Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities was $837.1 million for 2009 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1,690.7 million in 2008. The $2.53 billion change in financing activities was primarily due to the following: § Net repayments under our consolidated debt agreements of $276.9 million in 2009 compared to net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements of $2.75 billion in 2008. During 2008, EPO and TEPPCO issued a combined $2.6 billion in principal amount of senior notes. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Cash distributions paid to our partners increased $217.4 million year-to-year primarily due to increases in our common units outstanding and quarterly distribution rates. § Distributions paid to noncontrolling interests decreased $43.9 million year-to-year primarily due to the cessation of TEPPCO’s cash distributions following the TEPPCO Merger. § Net cash proceeds from the issuance of our common units increased $769.9 million year-to-year due to underwritten and private equity offerings in 2009 along with increased participation in our DRIP. § Contributions from noncontrolling interests decreased $172.8 million year-to-year primarily due to the $137.4 million of net cash proceeds that Duncan Energy Partners received from the issuance of its common units in June and July 2009 compared to net cash proceeds of $271.3 million received from unit offerings of TEPPCO during 2008. Comparison of 2008 with 2007 Operating Activities. The $386.5 million decrease in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following: § Net cash flows from consolidated operations (excluding distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates and cash payments for interest) decreased $240.1 million year-to-year. Although our gross operating margin increased year-to-year (see “Results of Operations” within this Item 7), the reduction in operating cash flow is generally due to the timing of related cash receipts and disbursements. The $240.1 million total year-to-year decrease also reflects a $127.3 million decrease in cash proceeds we received from insurance claims related to certain named storms. For information regarding cash proceeds from business interruption and property damage claims, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Cash payments for interest increased $140.2 million year-to-year primarily due to increased borrowings to finance our capital spending program. Our average debt balance for 2008 was $10.17 billion compared to $7.82 billion for 2007. Investing Activities. The $375.1 million increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: § Cash used for business combinations increased $517.5 million year-to-year, primarily due to approximately $346.0 million in business combinations related to our marine transportation businesses. In addition, during 2008 we acquired 100% of the membership interest in Great Divide and additional interest in consolidated subsidiaries. § Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs, decreased $194.0 million year-to-year. For additional information related to our capital spending program, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. 92 Table of Contents § Proceeds from the sale of assets and related transactions decreased $146.9 million year-to-year primarily due to the sale of certain equity interests and related storage assets located in Mont Belvieu, Texas during 2007. § Cash outlays for investments in unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $172.1 million year-to-year. Expenditures for 2007 include the $216.5 million we contributed to Cameron Highway during the second quarter of 2007. Cameron Highway used these funds, along with an equal contribution from our 50% joint venture partner in Cameron Highway, to repay approximately $430.0 million of its outstanding debt. Expenditures for 2008 include (i) $22.5 million in contributions to White River Hub, (ii) $11.1 million in contributions to Centennial and (iii) $36.0 million to acquire a 49% interest in Skelly-Belvieu. § An $85.5 million increase in restricted cash (a cash outflow) due to margin requirements related to our hedging activities. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our interest rate and commodity risk hedging portfolios. Financing Activities. The $744.4 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the following: § Net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements increased $923.8 million year-to-year. During 2008, we and TEPPCO issued a combined $2.6 billion in principal amount of senior notes. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Net cash proceeds from the issuance of our common units increased $73.6 million year-to-year due to increased participation in our DRIP. § Cash distributions paid to our partners increased $79.7 million year-to-year primarily due to increases in our common units outstanding and quarterly distribution rates. § Distributions paid to noncontrolling interests increased $57.1 million year-to-year primarily due to increases in the quarterly distribution rates of Duncan Energy Partners and TEPPCO, along with an increase in TEPPCO’s units outstanding. § The early termination and settlement of interest rate hedging derivative instruments during 2008 resulted in net cash payments of $66.5 million compared to net cash receipts of $49.1 million during the same period in 2007, which resulted in a $115.6 million decrease in financing cash flows between years. Capital Spending An integral part of our business strategy involves expansion through business combinations, growth capital projects and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are positioned to continue to grow our system of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas and/or crude oil production from resource basins in the Rocky Mountains, Midcontinent, Northeast and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, including the Barnett Shale, Haynesville Shale, Eagle Ford Shale, Marcellus Shale and deepwater Gulf of Mexico producing regions. Management continues to analyze potential acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. In past years, major oil and gas companies have sold non-strategic assets in the midstream energy sector in which we operate. We forecast that this trend will continue, and expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestitures. 93 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our capital spending by activity for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Capital spending for business combinations: Great Divide Gathering System acquisition $ -- $ 125.2 $ -- South Monco Pipeline System acquisition 0.8 -- 35.0 Cenac and Horizon acquisitions -- 345.7 -- Other business combinations 106.5 82.6 0.9 Total 107.3 553.5 35.9 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net: (1) Growth capital projects (2) 1,373.9 2,249.5 2,464.7 Sustaining capital projects (3) 192.6 262.9 241.7 Total 1,566.5 2,512.4 2,706.4 Capital spending for intangible assets: Acquisition of intangible assets 1.4 5.8 14.5 Capital spending attributable to unconsolidated affiliates: Investments in unconsolidated affiliates 18.8 64.7 236.8 Total capital spending $ 1,694.0 $ 3,136.4 $ 2,993.6 (1) On certain of our capital projects, third parties are obligated to reimburse us for all or a portion of project expenditures. The majority of such arrangements are associated with projects related to pipeline construction and production well tie-ins. Contributions in aid of construction costs were $17.8 million, $27.2 million and $57.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. (2) Growth capital projects either result in additional revenue streams from existing assets or expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to and major renewals of existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues. Based on information currently available, we estimate our consolidated capital spending for 2010 will approximate $1.75 billion, which includes estimated expenditures of $1.5 billion for growth capital projects and acquisitions and $250.0 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our forecast of consolidated capital expenditures is based on our current announced strategic operating and growth plans, which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or from other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, issuance of equity, and potential divestitures of certain assets to third and/or related parties. Our forecast of capital expenditures may change due to factors beyond our control, such as weather related issues, changes in supplier prices or adverse economic conditions. Furthermore, our forecast may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include acquisitions or decisions to take on additional partners. Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a principal factor that determines how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future operating growth needs, and although we currently intend to make the forecasted expenditures discussed above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital markets. At December 31, 2009, we had approximately $497.5 million in purchase commitments outstanding that relate to our capital spending for property, plant and equipment. These commitments primarily relate to construction at our Mont Belvieu complex and our Barnett Shale, Haynesville Shale and Piceance Basin natural gas pipeline projects. 94 Table of Contents Pipeline Integrity Costs Our NGL, crude oil, refined products, petrochemical and natural gas pipelines are subject to pipeline safety programs administered by the DOT. This federal agency has issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines (which include NGL, crude oil, refined products and petrochemical pipelines) and natural gas pipelines. In general, these regulations require companies to assess the condition of their pipelines in certain high consequence areas (as defined by the regulation) and to perform any necessary repairs. In April 2002, a subsidiary of ours acquired several midstream energy assets located in Texas and New Mexico from El Paso Corporation (“El Paso”). These assets included the Texas Intrastate System and the Carlsbad Gathering Systems. With respect to such assets, El Paso agreed to indemnify our subsidiary for any pipeline integrity costs it incurred (whether paid or payable) for five years following the acquisition date. The indemnity provisions did not take effect until such costs exceeded $3.3 million annually; however, the amount reimbursable by El Paso was capped at $50.2 million in the aggregate. In 2007, we recovered $31.1 million from El Paso related to our 2006 expenditures. During 2007, we received a final amount of $5.4 million from El Paso related to this indemnity. The following table summarizes our pipeline integrity costs, net of indemnity payments from El Paso, for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Expensed $ 44.9 $ 55.4 $ 51.9 Capitalized 37.7 86.2 78.9 Total $ 82.6 $ 141.6 $ 130.8 We expect our cash outlay for the pipeline integrity program, irrespective of whether such costs are capitalized or expensed, to approximate $116.3 million in 2010. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting process, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following describes the estimation risk currently underlying our most significant financial statement items: Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the assets. Our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in-service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include: § changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset; § changes in technology that render an asset obsolete; § changes in expected salvage values; or 95 Table of Contents § changes in the forecast life of applicable resource basins, if any. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was $17.69 billion and $16.73 billion, respectively. We recorded $678.1 million, $595.9 million and $515.7 million in depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Notes 2 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil or refined products. Long-lived assets with carrying values that are not expected to be recovered through forecast future cash flows are written down to their estimated fair values. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Our estimates of such undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated salvage values. An impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is based on a series of assumptions similar to those used to derive undiscounted cash flows. Those assumptions also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes, market values and replacement cost estimates. An equity method investment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible loss in value of the investment other than a temporary decline. Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee’s industry. Equity method investments with carrying values that are not expected to be recovered through expected future cash flows are written down to their estimated fair values. The carrying value of an equity method investment is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of discounted estimated cash flows expected to be derived from the investment. This estimate of discounted cash flows is based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment. A significant change in these underlying assumptions could result in our recording an impairment charge. During 2009, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment of $29.4 million, which is reflected as a component of operating costs and expenses. No such asset impairment charges were recorded in 2008 or 2007. During 2007, we evaluated our equity method investment in Nemo for impairment. As a result of this evaluation, we recorded a $7.0 million non-cash impairment charge that is a component of equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2007. During 2009 and 2008 there were no such impairment charges. For additional information regarding impairment charges associated with our long-lived assets and equity method investments, see Notes 6 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Amortization Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Qualifying Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential intangible assets include intellectual property, such as technology, patents, trademarks and trade names, customer contracts and relationships, and non-compete agreements, as well as other intangible assets. The method used to value each intangible asset will vary depending upon a number 96 Table of Contents of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. Our customer relationship intangible assets primarily represent customer bases we acquired in connection with business combinations. The value we assigned to these customer relationships is being amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits of the underlying oil and natural gas resource bases from which the customers produce are estimated to be consumed or otherwise used. Our estimate of the useful life of each resource base is predicated on a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. Our contract-based intangible assets represent the rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement or the natural gas transportation contracts of our Val Verde and Jonah systems. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated useful life (or term), which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of an entity. Our estimates of useful life are based on a number of factors, including: § the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., fractionation facility, pipeline or other asset); § any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights; and § any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such agreements. If our underlying assumptions regarding the estimated useful life of an intangible asset change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset’s unamortized cost is not recoverable due to impairment; we would be required to reduce the asset’s carrying value to fair value. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was $1.06 billion and $1.18 billion, respectively. We recorded $119.9 million, $130.0 million and $125.2 million in amortization expense associated with our intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase prices we paid for certain businesses over their respective fair values. We do not amortize goodwill; however, we test our goodwill for impairment at the beginning of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Our goodwill testing involves the determination of a reporting unit’s fair value, which is predicated on our assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the reporting unit. Such assumptions include: § discrete financial forecasts for the assets classified within the reporting unit, which rely on management’s estimates of operating margins and transportation volumes; § long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and 97 Table of Contents § appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of the reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a charge to earnings is required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its implied fair value. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment testing, each reporting unit’s fair value was substantially in excess (a minimum of 10%) of its carrying value. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying value of our goodwill was $2.02 billion. We recorded goodwill impairment charges of $1.3 million during 2009. No such impairment charges were recorded in 2008 or 2007. For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our Revenue Recognition Policies and Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses In general, we recognize revenue from customers when all of the following criteria are met: § persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; § delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; § the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable; and § collectability is reasonably assured. We record revenue when sales contracts are settled (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed). For additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. We record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts as required by our established policy. Our use of estimates for certain revenues and expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third-party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of such use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for a specific period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. If the assumptions underlying our estimates prove to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. We review our estimates based on currently available information. Reserves for Environmental Matters Our business activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations may, in certain instances, require us to remediate current or former operating sites where specified substances have been released or disposed of. We accrue reserves for environmental matters when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments are based on studies, as well as site surveys, to determine the extent of any environmental damage and the necessary requirements to remediate this damage. Future environmental developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws and additional claims for damages to property, employees and other persons 98 Table of Contents resulting from current or past operations, could result in substantial additional costs beyond our current reserves. In accruing for environmental remediation liabilities, costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to their present value, unless the amount and timing of the expenditures are fixed or reliably determinable. At December 31, 2009, none of our estimated environmental remediation liabilities were discounted to present value since the ultimate amount and timing of cash payments for such liabilities were not readily determinable. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a liability for environmental remediation of $16.7 million and $22.3 million, respectively, which was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon studies and site surveys. We have recorded our best estimate of the cost of remediation activities. See Notes 2 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding environmental matters. Natural Gas Imbalances In the natural gas pipeline transportation business, imbalances frequently result from differences in natural gas volumes received from and delivered to our customers. Such differences occur when a customer delivers more or less gas into our pipelines than is physically redelivered back to them during a particular time period. The vast majority of our settlements are through in-kind arrangements whereby incremental volumes are delivered to a customer (in the case of an imbalance payable) or received from a customer (in the case of an imbalance receivable). Such in-kind deliveries are ongoing and take place over several months. In some cases, settlements of imbalances accumulated over a period of time are ultimately cashed out and are generally negotiated at values which approximate average market prices over a period of time. As a result, for gas imbalances that are ultimately settled over future periods, we estimate the value of such current assets and liabilities using average market prices, which we believe is representative of the value of the imbalances upon final settlement. Changes in natural gas prices may impact our estimates. The following table presents our natural gas imbalance receivables/payables at the dates indicated: December 31, 2009 2008 Natural gas imbalance receivables (1) $ 24.1 $ 63.4 Natural gas imbalance payables (2) 19.0 50.8 (1) Reflected as a component of “Accounts and notes receivable – trade” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included under Item 8 of this annual report.

For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Our estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2009. With respect to variable-rate debt obligations, we applied the weighted-average interest rate paid during 2009 associated with such debt. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for the weighted-average variable interest rates charged in 2009 under our credit agreements. In addition, our estimate of cash payments for interest gives effect to interest rate swap agreements that were in place at December 31, 2009. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding these derivative instruments. Our estimated cash payments for interest are significantly influenced by the long-term maturities of our $550.0 million Junior Subordinated Notes A (due August 2066), $682.7 million Junior Subordinated Notes B (due January 2068), $300.0 million Junior Subordinated Notes C (due June 2067) and TEPPCO Junior Subordinated Notes (due June 2067). Our estimated cash payments for interest assume that these subordinated notes are not called prior to their respective maturity dates. (3) Primarily represents operating leases for (i) underground caverns for the storage of natural gas and NGLs, (ii) leased office space with an affiliate of EPCO and (iii) land held pursuant to right-of-way agreements. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services under the terms of each agreement at December 31, 2009. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2009 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Represents future payment commitments for services provided by third-parties. (6) Represents short-term unconditional payment obligations relating to our capital projects, including our share of those of our unconsolidated affiliates, for services rendered or products purchased. (7) As reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009, other long-term liabilities primarily represent noncurrent portions of asset retirement obligations, reserves for environmental remediation costs, accrued pipeline transportation deficiency fees, deferred revenues and the Centennial guarantee. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations involving operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 100 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Except for the following information regarding debt obligations of certain unconsolidated affiliates, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements, as described in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The following information summarizes the significant terms of such unconsolidated debt obligations. Poseidon. At December 31, 2009, Poseidon’s debt obligations consisted of $92.0 million outstanding under its $150.0 million variable-rate revolving credit facility. Amounts borrowed under this facility mature in May 2011 and are secured by substantially all of Poseidon’s assets. Poseidon expects to fund the repayment of its revolving credit facility (including accrued interest) with a variety of sources (either separately or in combination) including operating cash flows, refinancing agreements or cash contributions from its joint venture partners. Evangeline. At December 31, 2009, Evangeline’s debt obligations consisted of (i) $3.2 million in principal amount of 9.90% fixed rate Series B senior secured notes due December 2010 and (ii) a $7.5 million subordinated note payable due in 2011. Evangeline expects to fund the repayment of its debt obligations (including accrued interest) using operating cash flows. Centennial. At December 31, 2009, Centennial’s debt obligations consisted of $120.0 million borrowed under a master shelf loan agreement through two private placements, with interest rates ranging from 7.99% to 8.09%. Borrowings under the master shelf agreement mature in May 2024 and are collateralized by substantially all of Centennial’s assets and severally guaranteed by Centennial’s owners. Specifically, we and our joint venture partner in Centennial have each guaranteed one-half of Centennial’s debt obligations. If Centennial were to default on its debt obligations, our estimated payment obligation would be $60.0 million based on amounts outstanding at December 31, 2009.

Non-GAAP Reconciliations The following table presents a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measure of total segment gross operating margin to GAAP operating income and income before provision for income taxes for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Total segment gross operating margin $ 2,839.8 $ 2,609.0 $ 1,964.4 Adjustments to reconcile total segment gross operating margin to operating income: Depreciation, amortization and accretion in operating costs and expenses (809.3 ) (725.4 ) (647.9 ) Impairment charges in operating costs and expenses (33.5 ) -- -- Operating lease expenses paid by EPCO (0.7 ) (2.0 ) (2.1 ) Gain from asset sales and related transactions in operating costs and expenses -- 4.0 7.8 General and administrative costs (172.3 ) (137.2 ) (127.2 ) Operating income 1,824.0 1,748.4 1,195.0 Other expense, net (643.6 ) (528.5 ) (341.3 ) Income before provision for income taxes $ 1,180.4 $ 1,219.9 $ 853.7 101 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Developments The accounting standard setting bodies have recently issued the following guidance that will or may affect our future financial statements: § Fair Value Measurements; and § Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. For additional information regarding recent accounting developments, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the course of our normal business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates, commodity prices and, to a limited extent, foreign exchange rates. In order to manage risks associated with certain identifiable and anticipated transactions, we use derivative instruments. Derivatives are instruments whose fair value is determined by changes in a specified benchmark such as interest rates, commodity prices or currency values. Typical derivative instruments include futures, forward contracts, swaps, options and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments outstanding and related hedging activities, including associated fair value measurements. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the impact of derivative instruments on accumulated other comprehensive loss as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest Rate Derivative Instruments We utilize interest rate swaps, treasury locks and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in the interest rates of certain consolidated debt agreements. This strategy is a component in controlling our cost of capital associated with such borrowings. The following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value (“FV”) of our interest rate swap portfolios at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Enterprise Products Partners (excluding Duncan Energy Partners) Swap Fair Value at Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2008 2009 2010 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset $ 46.7 $ 41.3 $ 53.2 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset 42.4 35.0 47.9 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Asset 51.1 47.8 58.5 Duncan Energy Partners Swap Fair Value at Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2008 2009 2010 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Liability $ (9.8 ) $ (5.5 ) $ (5.7 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Liability (9.4 ) (5.5 ) (5.7 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Liability (10.2 ) (5.6 ) (5.7 ) 102 Table of Contents The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our forward starting swap portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Swap Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2009 January 31, 2010 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset $ 21.0 $ 13.3 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset 31.1 26.1 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) 10.5 (0.5 ) In January 2010, we entered into two additional forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $50.0 million each. In February 2010, we entered into three additional forward starting swaps with a notional amount of $50.0 million each. The period hedged by these five forward starting swaps is February 2012 through February 2022. Commodity Derivative Instruments The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. We may use commodity-based derivative instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps and options to mitigate such risks. We assess the risk of our commodity financial instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. The sensitivity analysis applied to these portfolios measures the potential income or loss (i.e., the change in fair value of the portfolio) based upon a hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying quoted market prices of the commodity derivative instruments outstanding at the date indicated within the following tables. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our natural gas marketing portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Swap Fair Value at Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2008 2009 2010 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ 6.5 $ (1.5 ) $ (2.3 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 2.7 (7.0 ) (6.3 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 9.9 4.1 1.8 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our NGL, refined products and petrochemical operations portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Swap Fair Value at Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2008 2009 2010 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ (102.1 ) $ (9.2 ) $ 21.3 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Liability (94.0 ) (43.2 ) (19.5 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (110.1 ) 24.8 62.0 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our crude oil marketing portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Swap Fair Value at Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2008 2009 2010 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset $ -- $ 2.0 $ 1.1 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset -- 2.0 1.1 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset -- 2.1 1.1 103 Table of Contents Our predominant hedging strategy is to hedge an amount of gross margin associated with the gas processing activities. We achieve this by using physical and financial instruments to lock in the prices of NGL sales and natural gas purchases used for PTR. This program consists of: § the forward sale of a portion of our expected equity NGL production at fixed prices through December 2010, achieved through the use of forward physical sales and commodity derivative instruments and § the purchase of commodity derivative instruments with a notional amount determined by the amount of natural gas expected to be consumed as PTR in the production of such equity NGL production. At December 31, 2009, this program had hedged future estimated gross margins (before plant operating expenses) of $178.9 million on 6.0 MMBbls of forecasted NGL forward sales transactions and equivalent PTR volumes extending through December 2010. At February 22, 2010, this program had hedged future estimated gross margins (before plant operating expenses) of $344.0 million on 10.8 MMBbls of forecasted NGL forward sales transactions and equivalent PTR volumes extending through December 2010. Our estimates of future gross margins are subject to various business risks, including unforeseen production outages or declines, counterparty risk, or similar events or developments that are outside of our control. Foreign Currency Derivative Instruments We are exposed to a nominal amount of foreign currency exchange risk in connection with our NGL marketing activities in Canada. As a result, we could be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency rates between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar. In order to manage this risk, we may enter into foreign exchange purchase contracts to lock in the exchange rate. At December 31, 2009, we had foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding with a notional amount of $4.1 million Canadian dollars. The fair value of this instrument was an asset of $0.2 million at December 31, 2009. Product Purchase Commitments We have long and short-term purchase commitments for natural gas, NGLs, petrochemicals and other hydrocarbons with several suppliers. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. For additional information regarding these commitments, see “Contractual Obligations” included under Item 7 of this annual report.",2023-12-30 21:17:26.203970

Overview of Business We are a North American midstream energy company providing a wide range of services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemicals. Our midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the United States, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and 84 Table of Contents international markets. In addition, we are an industry leader in the development of pipeline and other midstream energy infrastructure in the continental United States and Gulf of Mexico. We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 1998, the common units of which are listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “EPD.” We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO. We are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP, which is owned 100% by Dan Duncan LLC, owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. Our business segments reflect the manner in which these businesses are managed and reviewed by the CEO of our general partner. We have six reportable business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services; (ii) Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services; (iii) Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services; (iv) Offshore Pipelines & Services; (v) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services; and (vi) Other Investments. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the type of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. Significant Recent Developments The following information highlights significant developments since January 1, 2010 through the date of this filing (March 1, 2011), including (i) information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations, and (ii) certain unusual or infrequent events or transactions and known trends or uncertainties that have had or that we reasonably expect may have a material impact on our revenues or income from continuing operations. Offer to Acquire Duncan Energy Partners On February 22, 2011, Enterprise submitted a proposal to the Audit, Conflicts and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors of DEP GP to purchase all of Duncan Energy Partners' outstanding publicly-held common units through a unit-for-unit exchange. Subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, Enterprise would offer 0.9545 of its common units for each outstanding publicly-held Duncan Energy Partners’ common unit as part of a transaction that would be structured as a merger between Duncan Energy Partners and a wholly owned subsidiary of Enterprise. The proposed exchange ratio represents a value of $42.00 per common unit, or a premium of approximately 30%, based on the 10-day average closing price of Duncan Energy Partners’ common units on February 18, 2011. If the proposed merger is approved, Enterprise will file a registration statement, which will include a proxy statement of Duncan Energy Partners and other materials, with the SEC. Incident at Mont Belvieu Storage On February 8, 2011, a fire occurred at our Mont Belvieu, Texas storage complex (at the West Storage facility), which is jointly owned with Duncan Energy Partners. The incident resulted in one fatality. The West Storage facility consists of ten underground salt dome storage caverns with a storage capacity of approximately 15 MMBbls and an above-ground brine pit with a brine capacity of approximately 2 MMBbls. Operationally, we have focused on returning our Mont Belvieu facilities to as close to the same capabilities as we had prior to the event. We are changing our storage configuration to enable us to recover our receipt and delivery capabilities by utilizing our North and East Storage facilities. We continue to work with authorities to determine the cause of the event. Our insurance deductible for property damage events such as this is $5 million per occurrence. At this time, due to the recent nature of this incident, we are not able to estimate any additional losses related to this event other than the property damage insurance deductible. Holdings Merger On November 22, 2010, the Holdings Merger Agreement was approved by the unitholders of Holdings and the merger of Holdings with MergerCo and related transactions were completed, with MergerCo surviving such merger. At the effective time of the Holdings Merger, Enterprise GP (which was the general partner of Holdings prior to consummation of the Holdings Merger) succeeded as Enterprise’s 85 Table of Contents general partner, and each issued and outstanding unit representing limited partner interests in Holdings was cancelled and converted into the right to receive Enterprise common units based on an exchange ratio of 1.5 Enterprise common units for each Holdings unit. Enterprise issued an aggregate of 208,813,454 of its common units (net of 23 fractional common units cashed out) as consideration in the Holdings Merger and, immediately after the merger, cancelled 21,563,177 of its common units previously owned by Holdings. In connection with the Holdings Merger, Enterprise’s partnership agreement was amended and restated to effect the cancellation of EPGP’s 2% economic general partner interest and its incentive distribution rights in Enterprise. In addition, a privately held affiliate of EPCO agreed to temporarily waive the regular quarterly cash distributions it would otherwise receive from Enterprise on an initial amount of 30,610,000 of Enterprise’s common units (the “Designated Units”) for a five-year period after the merger closing date. The number of Designated Units to which the temporary distribution waiver applies is as follows for distributions to be paid during the following periods, if any: 30,610,000 during 2011; 26,130,000 during 2012; 23,700,000 during 2013; 22,560,000 during 2014; and 17,690,000 during 2015. New Enterprise NGL Fractionator Begins Commercial Operations In November 2010, we announced that our fourth NGL fractionator at our Mont Belvieu, Texas complex had commenced operations. The new NGL fractionator provides 75 MBPD of capacity to accommodate growing NGL volumes from producing areas such as the Barnett Shale in North Texas and the Rockies. The new facility is supported by long-term, firm contracts and increases NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex to 305 MBPD. Duncan Energy Partners Executes $1.25 Billion in New Credit Facilities In October 2010, Duncan Energy Partners entered into new long-term variable-rate senior unsecured credit facilities having an aggregate borrowing capacity of $1.25 billion. The new Duncan Energy Partners credit facilities mature in October 2013 and consist of: (i) an $850.0 million multi-year revolving credit facility (the “DEP Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility”) and (ii) a $400.0 million term loan facility (the “DEP $400 Million Term Loan Facility”). At closing, Duncan Energy Partners borrowed the full amount available under the DEP $400 Million Term Loan Facility to repay amounts outstanding under the DEP Revolving Credit Facility and an intercompany loan with EPO. Upon repayment, the DEP Revolving Credit Facility and the loan agreement with EPO were terminated. Duncan Energy Partners’ existing $282.3 million DEP Term Loan remains in place and is scheduled to mature in December 2011. Duncan Energy Partners entered into the new $1.25 billion credit agreements primarily to fund its 66% share of the Haynesville Extension project costs. Variable interest rates charged under the new credit facilities are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (or “LIBOR”) or a base rate, both as defined in the agreements. Expansion of Eagle Ford Shale Capabilities with New Construction Projects We continue to expand our midstream asset capabilities in the Eagle Ford Shale supply basin in South Texas and recently announced new commercial agreements with several major producers including EOG Resources, Inc., Anadarko, Petrohawk Energy Corporation and Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc. In June 2010, we announced several new natural gas, NGL and crude oil infrastructure construction projects to accommodate growing production volumes from the Eagle Ford Shale. We plan to install approximately 360 miles of pipelines, build a new natural gas processing facility in South Texas and construct a 75 MBPD NGL fractionator at our Mont Belvieu complex. Following completion of these construction projects, which is expected in mid-2012, we will have the capability to gather, transport and process almost 2.1 Bcf/d of natural gas and produce more than 150 MBPD of NGLs from South Texas and the Eagle Ford Shale. The planned construction projects include an expansion of our Eagle Ford rich natural gas mainline that will involve adding three additional pipeline segments totaling 168 miles. Upon completion, 86 Table of Contents the rich gas mainline system and associated laterals will consist of approximately 300 miles of pipelines representing gathering and transportation capacity of more than 600 MMcf/d. The east end of the Eagle Ford mainline will terminate at a new cryogenic natural gas processing facility we plan to build that will produce in excess of 60 MBPD of mixed NGLs. Takeaway capacity for residue gas from the new processing facility will be provided by a combination of our existing pipeline infrastructure and construction of additional natural gas pipelines, including a new 64-mile, 36-inch diameter pipeline that terminates at our Wilson natural gas storage facility. An expansion project to increase capacity at the Wilson gas storage facility by 5 Bcf is currently underway. Transportation of mixed NGLs from our new processing facility to our Mont Belvieu complex will be accomplished by expanding our infrastructure, highlighted by the planned construction of a new 127-mile, 16-inch diameter NGL pipeline. This new pipeline will have an initial transportation capacity of more than 60 MBPD, and will be readily expandable to over 210 MBPD if needed. To accommodate expected volumes from the Eagle Ford Shale and other producing regions, we plan to construct a fifth NGL fractionator with a design capacity of 75 MBPD at our Mont Belvieu complex. The addition of this fifth unit will increase NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex to approximately 380 MBPD. In addition to the natural gas and NGL projects described above, we are also constructing a 140-mile crude oil pipeline and associated storage assets that will serve producers in the Eagle Ford Shale basin. This new pipeline will facilitate crude oil deliveries to the Cushing and Houston markets and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2011. Operations Commence at New Port Arthur Refined Products Storage Facility In June 2010, we announced that the partnership's new refined products storage facility in Port Arthur, Texas, which was built to support the expansion of a nearby third-party refinery, had commenced commercial operations and received its first deliveries. The new tank farm serves as the sole distribution point for output from the refinery as part of a 15-year throughput and volume dedication agreement. Our Port Arthur storage facility, which represents an investment of approximately $330.0 million, features 5.4 MMBbls of storage capacity for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. The storage facility provides our customer with access to several major refined products pipelines, including our Products Pipeline System. Acquisition of State Line and Fairplay Natural Gas Gathering Systems In May 2010, we acquired 100% ownership of the State Line and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems and related assets from Momentum for approximately $1.2 billion in cash. These systems are located in northwest Louisiana and East Texas and gather and treat natural gas produced from the Haynesville/Bossier Shales and the Cotton Valley and Taylor Sand formations. We used a portion of the net proceeds from our April 2010 equity offering, together with borrowings under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility, to fund this acquisition. The State Line system is located in Desoto and Caddo Parishes, Louisiana and Panola County, Texas. The system currently includes approximately 188 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines having an aggregate gathering capacity of approximately 700 MMcf/d and two natural gas treating facilities. The State Line system began operations in February 2009 and is currently gathering approximately 397 MMcf/d of natural gas. The Fairplay system is located in Rusk, Panola, Gregg and Nacogdoches counties, Texas. The system includes approximately 249 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines having an aggregate gathering capacity of approximately 285 MMcf/d. The Fairplay system is currently gathering approximately 156 MMcf/d of natural gas. Our operations related to the Fairplay system include providing natural gas processing services using third-party processing facilities. The State Line and Fairplay systems are supported by long-term acreage dedication agreements totaling approximately 210,000 acres, as well as volumetric commitments from producers. Our State Line system will connect to our Haynesville Extension natural gas pipeline project. The Haynesville Extension, which is under development by Acadian Gas, is expected to provide shippers with takeaway capacity from the Haynesville Shale producing basin and flexible options for reaching attractive 87 Table of Contents markets for their natural gas, including access to nine interstate gas pipeline systems. The Fairplay system is expected to extend our asset base through planned future interconnects with our Texas Intrastate System, along with supporting deliveries of NGLs into our Panola pipeline and further to our fractionation, storage and distribution complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Basis of Financial Statement Presentation In accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC and various other accounting standard-setting organizations, our general purpose financial statements reflect the consolidation of the financial information of businesses that we control such as through the ownership of general partner interests (e.g., Duncan Energy Partners). Our general purpose consolidated financial statements present those investments in which we do not have a controlling interest as unconsolidated affiliates (e.g., our equity method investment in Energy Transfer Equity). As presented in our consolidated financial statements, noncontrolling interest reflects third-party and related party ownership of our consolidated subsidiaries. Prior to the Holdings Merger, Enterprise was a consolidated subsidiary of Holdings, which was Enterprise’s parent. Upon completion of the Holdings Merger, Holdings merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Enterprise. The Holdings Merger was accounted for as an equity transaction, and no gain or loss was recognized, in accordance with ASC 810-10-45, Consolidation – Overall – Changes in Parent’s Ownership Interest in a Subsidiary. The Holdings Merger results in Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. being considered the surviving consolidated entity for accounting purposes, while Enterprise Products Partners L.P. is the surviving consolidated entity for legal and reporting purposes. For accounting purposes, Holdings is deemed the acquirer of the noncontrolling interests in Enterprise that were previously recognized in Holdings’ consolidated financial statements (i.e., the acquisition of Enterprise’s limited partner interests that were owned by parties other than Holdings). As a result of the Holdings Merger, Enterprise’s consolidated financial and operating results prior to November 22, 2010 have been presented as if Enterprise were Holdings from an accounting perspective (i.e., the financial statements of Holdings became the historical financial statements of Enterprise). While it was a publicly traded partnership, Holdings (NYSE: EPE) electronically filed its annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You can access this information at www.sec.gov. The primary differences between Holdings’ and Enterprise’s consolidated results of operations were (i) general and administrative costs incurred by Holdings and EPGP (our former general partner); (ii) equity in income of Holdings’ noncontrolling ownership interests in Energy Transfer Equity; and (iii) interest expense associated with Holdings’ debt. In addition, for periods prior to November 22, 2010, the net assets, income, cash distributions and contributions and other amounts attributable to Enterprise’s limited partner interests that were owned by third parties and related parties other than Holdings are presented as a component of noncontrolling interest. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our noncontrolling interests. Historical limited partner units outstanding and earnings per unit amounts presented in our financial statements have been retroactively presented in connection with the 1.5 to one unit-for-unit exchange that occurred under the Holdings Merger. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding earnings per unit. 88 Table of Contents General Outlook for 2011 Commercial Outlook We provide midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemicals. Factors that can affect the demand for our services include global and U.S. economic conditions, the demand for energy, the market price of energy, the cost to develop natural gas and crude oil reserves in the U.S. and the cost and availability of capital to energy companies to invest in drilling activities. The global economic expansion that began in late 2009 continued throughout 2010, with all of the twenty largest developed economies (the “G20”) reporting year-over-year growth in real gross domestic product (or “GDP”) for 2010. This growth appears to be continuing in early 2011. The United States reported year-over-year real GDP growth of 2.8% for 2010 compared to 2009. By comparison, the United States reported year-over-year real GDP growth of 0.1% for 2009 compared to 2008. Similar to the rate of economic growth, U.S. demand for petroleum products and natural gas (as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration) increased by approximately 2.0% and 4.5%, respectively, for the first ten months of 2010 versus the same period in 2009. Likewise, U.S. demand for petroleum products for transportation purposes (e.g., motor gasoline, distillate and jet fuel) for the first ten months of 2010 increased by 1.6% compared to the same period of 2009. Energy prices have generally rebounded with the recovery in demand and economic growth. The average prices of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, Henry Hub natural gas and Mont Belvieu ethane for 2010 were approximately $79.53 per barrel, $4.39 MMBtu, and $0.60 per gallon, respectively, which increased by approximately 29%, 10% and 24%, respectively, from 2009. Notably, the substantial change in the price relationship between natural gas and crude oil that began in 2009 has continued. In 2008, natural gas was priced at 52% of crude oil on an energy equivalent basis compared to 37% in 2009 and 31% in 2010. Natural gas and NGLs have had a significant price advantage over more costly crude oil and crude oil derivatives (such as naphtha) and this trend is expected to continue based on prices currently quoted on the futures markets. This has been primarily driven by (i) a decline in global crude oil excess production capacity; (ii) more government-held acreage being off limits to non-sovereign energy companies; (iii) geopolitical risk; (iv) growing demand for crude oil by China, India and other developing countries; (v) the globalization of international natural gas markets with more foreign-based LNG liquefaction facilities becoming operational; (vi) the technological breakthroughs around the development of natural gas shale resource basins in the United States that have decreased finding and development costs for natural gas and NGLs; and (vii) the general inability to export natural gas from the United States. We believe this has led to a long-term structural change in feedstock selection by the petrochemical industry. For ethylene producers, which are the largest consumers of NGLs, ethane and propane have been the most consistently profitable feedstocks in 2009 and 2010 and are forecasted to remain so in 2011. Lower feedstock costs have provided U.S. ethylene producers with a competitive cost advantage globally, especially relative to crackers in Europe and Asia, which are limited to naphtha feedstocks. Per industry publications, domestic production of ethylene increased approximately 6% from 2009 to 2010 and notional domestic demand was up approximately 10%. As a result of increased domestic demand, net exports of ethylene and ethylene derivatives in 2010 decreased to approximately 19% of ethylene production, which compares to 22% of domestic production that was exported in 2009. U.S. ethylene producers responded by maximizing their use of NGLs as a feedstock, rationalizing some of their facilities and investing capital, beginning in 2009, to modify their furnaces to crack more NGLs. The U.S. ethylene industry consumed an average of approximately 743 MBPD of ethane from 2004 through 2008. In 2010, the average ethane consumption of U.S. ethylene producers increased by 19.8% to 89 Table of Contents approximately 890 MBPD. Based on our internal estimates, during certain days in December 2010, we believe the domestic ethylene industry’s demand for ethane exceeded 1 million barrels per day. We estimate the U.S. ethylene industry could consume approximately 100 MBPD of incremental ethane and propane feedstocks over the next two years through modifications to existing facilities. Certain non-U.S. based ethylene crackers have responded to the NGL feedstock cost advantage by importing propane, including propane produced in the U.S., to displace crude oil derivatives to feed their heavy crackers. Strong end user demand for NGLs and increases in NGL-rich natural gas production from developing shale plays such as the Eagle Ford Shale are expected to (i) keep certain of our natural gas pipelines and processing plants and our NGL fractionators, pipelines, storage and export facilities operating at high utilization rates; (ii) provide attractive natural gas processing margins for our equity NGL production; and (iii) provide us with opportunities to invest capital to build new natural gas pipelines and processing facilities; NGL fractionation and pipeline facilities; and crude oil pipelines. Henry Hub natural gas prices have significantly declined from a peak of over $13.00 per MMBtu in mid-2008 to less than $4.00 per MMBtu in February 2011. This price decrease has generally resulted in energy companies reallocating and, in some cases, reducing their drilling capital expenditure budgets. This led to a substantial decrease in the number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S., declining from a peak of 1,606 rigs in August 2008 to a low of 665 rigs in July 2009 as natural gas prices approached a low of $1.88 per MMBtu in September 2009. The natural gas rig count has since rebounded and averaged 940 rigs in 2010. Even though the total natural gas rig count has dropped from peak levels, the substantial efficiencies of horizontal drilling in the non-conventional and shale supply basins have allowed producers to maintain overall natural gas deliverability. As a result, rig count is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the level of future natural gas production or reserves. Because of the market prices of crude oil and NGLs, drilling activity is especially robust in shale plays with crude oil, condensate and NGL-rich natural gas production such as the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash, Bakken and Marcellus. Drilling activity in shale plays with dry natural gas production, such as the Haynesville/Bossier and Fayetteville, is down slightly from peak levels, but remains very active as certain producers are drilling to hold recently executed leases or have entered into joint ventures whereby their new joint venture partners are providing the capital to fund the development of the area for a certain time and for a certain dollar amount. Generally, rig counts remain significantly below peak levels in areas with conventional natural gas reserves, which may have higher finding costs, and areas where producers already have leases held by production. Based on forecasted drilling activity, the number of wells waiting to be connected to our pipeline systems and the respective production decline curves, we believe the aggregate natural gas pipeline volumes transported on our Jonah Gas Gathering, Piceance Basin Gathering and San Juan Gathering systems for 2010 could range from an increase of 5% to a decrease of 5% compared to volumes transported in 2010. These areas have substantial, undeveloped non-conventional natural gas reserves with some of the lowest finding costs in the U.S.; prospects to develop additional shale horizons; and are supported by existing pipeline infrastructure to transport the natural gas to market. We believe that as U.S. natural gas supply and demand becomes more balanced and natural gas prices become less volatile, these areas could experience an increase in drilling activity to support, and potentially increase, current production levels. In the Eagle Ford Shale, which runs parallel to the Texas Gulf Coast and adjacent to our Texas Intrastate System, we have completed several pipeline projects that enable us to gather, transport and process up to 300 MMcf/d of new natural gas production from the area. Generally, energy companies have had early success in the Eagle Ford Shale and several have indicated they plan to accelerate their associated drilling programs. Production from this region includes crude oil, condensate, NGL-rich natural gas and lean natural gas. In 2010, we announced expansions of our natural gas pipeline, storage and processing facilities; NGL pipeline and fractionation facilities; and crude oil pipeline and storage facilities to facilitate production growth from this region. These projects represent approximately $2.7 billion of capital expenditures in the aggregate from 2010 through 2012. Natural gas production growth from the Haynesville/Bossier shale area of northern Louisiana is expected to grow rapidly over the next several years. In late 2009, we announced that seven energy companies had executed long-term agreements to support the Haynesville Extension project of our Acadian 90 Table of Contents Gas System. The Haynesville Extension is a 270-mile, 42-inch/36-inch pipeline designed to transport 1.8 Bcf/d of natural gas. Construction of the pipeline began in January 2011 and is scheduled to begin commercial operations in September 2011. Total capital cost for the Haynesville Extension is approximately $1.56 billion. We estimate that natural gas and crude oil volumes handled by our offshore Gulf of Mexico assets will be lower in 2011 than 2010 due to lower drilling and development activities in the second half of 2010 and the beginning of 2011 caused by federal regulatory uncertainty in the aftermath of BP’s Macando oil spill. We believe volumes on our systems will increase from 2010 levels once drilling and development activities resume. We estimate average volumes on our largest offshore asset, the Independence Hub platform and Trail pipeline will range between 450 BBtus/d and 500 BBtus/d in 2011 compared to an average of 576 BBtus/d in 2010. Our refined products pipeline systems generally serve the Petroleum Administration for Defense District (“PADD”) 2 of the U.S. Demand for refined products in this region for 2010 was approximately 4.5 MMBbls/d, which was a 2.2% change compared to 2009. Throughput volumes in 2010 on our refined products pipeline systems increased to 734 MBPD, or an 8% increase compared to 2009. We do not expect a significant increase in refined product demand in 2011 in this region due to soft economic conditions and ongoing conservation. Liquidity Outlook The corporate debt and equity capital markets continued to improve in 2010. Sovereign credit markets, however, continue to be volatile due to large budget deficits being incurred by the United States, United Kingdom and many developed European countries. The cost of our term debt and equity capital generally declined to pre-financial crisis levels. The availability of term debt and equity capital also improved. Likewise, the general availability of credit commitments from most banks also improved from a year ago; however, the cost of new bank debt is higher than pre-crisis levels (by approximately 1.5% on borrowed money). In January 2011, we completed a public offering of $750 million of 5-year senior notes and $750 million of 30-year senior notes. On February 1, 2011, we retired $450 million of maturing senior notes. After adjusting our liquidity at December 31, 2010 for these events, we had consolidated liquidity of approximately $2.9 billion. We currently estimate that our capital expenditures for 2011 will approximate $3.7 billion, which includes approximately $3.4 billion for growth capital projects and $260 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Based on current market conditions, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs. Also, based on information currently available to us, we believe we will maintain our investment grade credit ratings and meet our loan covenant obligations in 2011. We have approximately $3.35 billion of senior notes maturing in the period beginning 2012 through the end of 2014. In addition, we have bank term loans and bank credit facilities with commitments totaling approximately $3.3 billion maturing in the period beginning December 2011 through the end of 2013. The U.S. government is expected to run substantial annual budget deficits, exceeding a trillion dollars, that will require a corresponding issuance of debt by the U.S. Treasury from 2011 through 2014. The interest rate on U.S. Treasury debt has a direct impact on the cost of our debt. At this time, we are uncertain what the impact of the expected large issuances of U.S. Treasury debt and the prevailing economic and capital market conditions during these future periods will have on the cost and availability of capital. To date, we have executed approximately $1.65 billion of interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our expected future debt issuances in connection with the refinancing of our debt that matures during the 2012 through 2013 time period. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the condition of the capital markets and interest rate risk with respect to refinancing these maturities and funding our capital expenditures. 91 Table of Contents Results of Operations Selected Price and Volumetric Data The following table presents selected annual and quarterly industry index prices for natural gas, crude oil and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods presented: Polymer Refinery Natural Normal Natural Grade Grade Gas, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Gasoline, Propylene, Propylene, Crude Oil, $/MMBtu $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/pound $/pound $/barrel (1) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (3) (3) (4) 2008 Averages $ 9.04 $ 0.89 $ 1.41 $ 1.68 $ 1.72 $ 2.09 $ 0.62 $ 0.52 $ 99.73 2009 1st Quarter $ 4.91 $ 0.36 $ 0.68 $ 0.87 $ 0.97 $ 0.96 $ 0.26 $ 0.20 $ 43.31 2nd Quarter $ 3.51 $ 0.43 $ 0.73 $ 0.93 $ 1.11 $ 1.21 $ 0.34 $ 0.28 $ 59.79 3rd Quarter $ 3.39 $ 0.47 $ 0.87 $ 1.12 $ 1.19 $ 1.42 $ 0.48 $ 0.43 $ 68.24 4th Quarter $ 4.16 $ 0.67 $ 1.09 $ 1.39 $ 1.49 $ 1.64 $ 0.50 $ 0.44 $ 76.19 2009 Averages $ 3.99 $ 0.48 $ 0.84 $ 1.08 $ 1.19 $ 1.31 $ 0.39 $ 0.34 $ 61.88 2010 1st Quarter $ 5.30 $ 0.73 $ 1.24 $ 1.52 $ 1.64 $ 1.82 $ 0.63 $ 0.54 $ 78.72 2nd Quarter $ 4.09 $ 0.55 $ 1.08 $ 1.47 $ 1.58 $ 1.81 $ 0.65 $ 0.44 $ 78.03 3rd Quarter $ 4.38 $ 0.48 $ 1.07 $ 1.38 $ 1.43 $ 1.71 $ 0.58 $ 0.44 $ 76.20 4th Quarter $ 3.80 $ 0.64 $ 1.26 $ 1.62 $ 1.68 $ 2.00 $ 0.59 $ 0.49 $ 85.17 2010 Averages $ 4.39 $ 0.60 $ 1.16 $ 1.50 $ 1.58 $ 1.84 $ 0.61 $ 0.48 $ 79.53 (1) Natural gas prices are based on Henry-Hub I-FERC commercial index prices.

During 2010 and 2009, our largest non-affiliated customer was Shell Oil Company and its affiliates, which accounted for 9.4% and 9.8% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. During 2008, our largest non-affiliated customer was Valero Energy Corporation and its affiliates, which accounted for 11.2% of our consolidated revenues. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2010 with Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenues for 2010 were $33.74 billion compared to $25.51 billion for 2009, an $8.23 billion year-to-year increase. Higher energy commodity sales prices and volumes during 2010 compared to 2009 resulted in a $7.99 billion year-to-year increase in consolidated revenues from the sale of NGLs, natural 94 Table of Contents gas, crude oil and petrochemical and refined products. Consolidated revenues from sales of NGLs increased $1.85 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices during 2010 compared to 2009. Revenues from sales of natural gas increased $518.3 million year-to-year due to higher sales prices and volumes. Crude oil sales revenues increased $3.6 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices. Consolidated revenues from sales of other petroleum and related products increased $2.02 billion year-to-year primarily due to (i) higher petrochemical and refined products sales volumes and (ii) higher propylene sales prices during 2010 compared to 2009. Collectively, the remainder of our consolidated revenues increased $240.1 million year-to-year primarily due to revenues generated from businesses we acquired or assets we constructed, principally the State Line and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems we acquired in May 2010 and a trucking business we acquired from EPCO in September 2010. Operating costs and expenses were $31.45 billion for 2010 compared to $23.57 billion for 2009, a $7.88 billion year-to-year increase. The cost of sales related to our marketing activities increased $7.23 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher energy commodity prices and sales volumes. The operating costs and expenses of our natural gas processing plants increased $493.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher plant thermal reduction (“PTR”) costs attributable to an increase in natural gas prices and processing volumes. Operating costs and expenses for 2010 include approximately $174.3 million attributable to business acquisitions and the placing in service of newly constructed assets during the year. Operating costs and expenses for 2009 include aggregate charges of $135.3 million related to our dissociation from the Texas Offshore Port System partnership (“TOPS”) and $28.7 million of expenses incurred by TEPPCO in connection with its river terminal business. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses included in operating costs and expenses increased $127.0 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense attributable to assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions in 2010 and the placing in service of newly constructed assets during 2010. We recorded $8.4 million of non-cash asset impairment charges during 2010 compared to $33.5 million of charges during 2009, a $25.1 million year-to-year decrease. Non-cash impairment charges recorded in 2009 include $22.8 million of expense incurred by TEPPCO related to its refined products terminals. Gains from asset sales and related transactions included in operating costs and expenses increased $44.4 million year-to-year, which is primarily due to $56.6 million of insurance-related gains recorded in connection with our disposition of certain offshore assets in 2010. Changes in our revenues and operating costs and expenses year-to-year are explained in part by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $1.16 per gallon during 2010 versus $0.85 per gallon during 2009 – a 36% year-to-year increase. Our determination of the weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs is based on U.S. Gulf Coast prices for such products at Mont Belvieu, Texas, which is the primary industry hub for domestic NGL production. The market price of natural gas (as measured at Henry Hub in Louisiana) averaged $4.39 per MMBtu during 2010 versus $3.99 per MMBtu during 2009. The market price of crude oil (as measured on the NYMEX) averaged $79.53 per barrel during 2010 compared to $61.88 per barrel during 2009 – a 29% year-to-year increase. See “Selected Price and Volumetric Data” included within this Item 7 for additional historical energy commodity pricing information. General and administrative costs were $204.8 million for 2010 compared to $182.8 million for 2009, a $22.0 million year-to-year increase. General and administrative costs for 2010 include $20.2 million of expense related to the Employee Partnership liquidations and $24.5 million of expenses related to the Holdings Merger. General and administrative costs for 2009 include $31.0 million of expenses related to the TEPPCO Merger. Collectively, the remainder of our general and administrative costs increased $8.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher expenses for director compensation and legal and tax professional services. Equity in income of our unconsolidated affiliates was $62.0 million for 2010 compared to $92.3 million for 2009. The $30.3 million year-to-year decrease is primarily due to a $43.9 million decrease in equity earnings from Energy Transfer Equity, partially offset by improved results from our investments in midstream energy companies operating in Gulf of Mexico and higher earnings from Promix and Centennial. 95 Table of Contents Operating income for 2010 was $2.15 billion compared to $1.85 billion for 2009. Collectively, the changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates described above resulted in the $292.6 million year-to-year increase in operating income. Interest expense increased to $741.9 million for 2010 from $687.3 million for 2009, a $54.6 million year-to-year increase. Interest expense for 2010 includes $31.0 million of charges related to Holdings’ interest rate swaps and the write-off of Holdings’ unamortized debt issuance costs. The remainder of the increase in interest expense is primarily due to EPO’s issuance of Senior Notes Q and R during October 2009 and Senior Notes X, Y and Z in May 2010. Average debt principal outstanding increased to $13.23 billion during 2010 from $13.0 billion during 2009. Provision for income taxes increased $0.8 million year-to-year. Higher expenses associated with the Texas Margin Tax were partially offset by a $6.6 million one-time charge associated with taxable gains arising from the sale of certain assets by Dixie Pipeline Company (“Dixie”) during 2009. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, our consolidated net income increased $243.4 million year-to-year to $1.38 billion for 2010 compared to $1.14 billion for 2009. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $1.06 billion for 2010 compared to $936.2 million for 2009. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to partners increased $116.7 million year-to-year to $320.8 million for 2010 compared to $204.1 million for 2009. The following information highlights significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services.

Gross operating margin for 2009 includes $5.9 million of gains related to insurance proceeds. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding gains from insurance proceeds. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business was $989.9 million for 2010 compared to $947.9 million for 2009, a $42.0 million year-to-year increase. Equity NGL production increased to 121 MBPD during 2010 from 117 MBPD during 2009. Our Rocky Mountains natural gas processing plants contributed $31.6 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin primarily due to increased equity NGL production. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing activities in Texas increased $16.4 million year-to-year due to higher volumes and processing margins, including $9.8 million of gross operating margin attributable to natural gas processing activities on the Fairplay system, which we acquired in May 2010. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased $4.5 million year-to-year due to higher sales volumes and margins. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our natural gas processing activities decreased $10.5 million year-to-year primarily due to lower natural gas processing margins and fee-based processing volumes in at our plants in southern Louisiana and the San Juan and Permian Basins. Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage business was $604.8 million for 2010 compared to $538.9 million for 2009, a $65.9 million year-to-year increase. Total NGL transportation volumes increased to 2,322 MBPD during 2010 from 2,196 MBPD during 2009. Collectively, gross operating margin from our Louisiana NGL pipelines and Dixie Pipeline increased $55.7 million year-to-year primarily due to a 50 MBPD increase in throughput volumes and an increase in certain fees. Gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel import/export terminal and a related pipeline increased $17.6 million year-to-year primarily due to a 46 MBPD year-to-year increase in volumes. Gross operating margin from our storage and related terminal businesses increased $29.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher storage volumes and fees, with our Mont Belvieu storage facility contributing $12.7 million of this increase. In addition, gross operating margin from our Rio Grande pipeline, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009, increased $5.3 million year-to-year. Improved results from these 96 Table of Contents assets were partially offset by a combined $39.2 million decrease in gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related terminals attributable to a $29.2 million benefit recorded for the Mid-America Pipeline System in 2009 related to a rate case settlement, a combined 16 MBPD decrease in throughput volumes on these systems and higher operating expenses. Gross operating margin from our remaining NGL pipelines decreased $2.6 million year-to-year primarily due to a $6.8 million charge we recorded during the third quarter of 2010 for a dispute involving a pipeline in South Texas. Gross operating margin from our NGL fractionation business was $137.9 million for 2010 compared to $136.0 million for 2009, a $1.9 million increase year-to-year. Our NGL fractionation volumes were 485 MBPD during 2010 compared to 461 MBPD during 2009. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu and Promix NGL fractionation facilities increased $15.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher NGL fractionation volumes and fees. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we added 75 MBPD of NGL fractionation capacity by completing and placing into service a fourth NGL fractionator at our complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Gross operating margin from the remainder of our NGL fractionators decreased $13.2 million year-to-year, primarily due to a $12.6 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin from our Norco fractionator related to hedging and operating gains recorded during 2009 that did not repeat in 2010. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $527.2 million for 2010 compared to $501.5 million for 2009, a $25.7 million year-to-year increase.

Gross operating margin for 2010 includes $33.0 million from the State Line and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems, which we acquired in May 2010. Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System increased $22.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher firm capacity reservation fees on the Sherman Extension pipeline. Gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System increased $26.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average gathering fees and lower operating expenses during 2010 compared to 2009. Our Central Treating Facility in the Rocky Mountains, which commenced operations in March 2009, contributed $11.5 million of the year-to-year increase in segment gross operating margin. Collectively, gross operating margin from our Jonah, Val Verde and Carlsbad gathering systems decreased $21.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower natural gas gathering volumes. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our onshore natural gas pipelines and related marketing activities decreased $48.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins and higher transportation and storage expenses associated with our natural gas marketing activities. Natural gas basis differentials in Texas (specifically, the difference in natural gas prices between markets in West Texas and East Texas) were significantly lower during 2010 relative to 2009. The year-to-year decrease in basis differentials resulted in lower sales margins associated with our natural gas marketing activities during 2010 and a decrease in interruptible transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System. Gross operating margin from our natural gas storage business was $55.5 million for 2010 compared to $53.0 million for 2009. The $2.5 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher revenues and lower operating expenses at our Petal natural gas storage facility during 2010 compared to 2009. Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $113.7 million for 2010 compared to $164.4 million for 2009, a $50.7 million decrease year-to-year. Total onshore crude oil transportation volumes decreased to 670 MBPD during 2010 compared to 680 MBPD during 2009. Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related activities decreased $53.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins resulting from a competitive crude oil marketing environment (i.e., lower basis differentials year-to-year) and higher pipeline and truck transportation costs. 97 Table of Contents Basis differentials represent the difference in crude oil prices between two locations or price differences for various qualities of crude oil (e.g., “sweet” crude versus “sour” crude). Gross operating margin from our crude oil terminal operations in Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma decreased $3.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating expenses. Collectively, gross operations from the remainder of our onshore crude oil businesses increased $6.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher throughput volumes on our West Texas pipeline system and higher volumes and fees on our Red River pipeline system. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $297.8 million for 2010 compared to $180.5 million for 2009, a $117.3 million increase year-to-year. Results for 2010 include $27.5 million of gains related to insurance proceeds compared to $39.7 million of such gains in 2009. Results for 2009 include $135.3 million of charges related to our dissociation from TOPS. Gross operating margin from this business segment decreased $5.8 million year-to-year excluding the effects of insurance proceeds and charges related to TOPS. In August 2008, we, including TEPPCO, together with Oiltanking Holding Americas, Inc. (“Oiltanking”) formed TOPS. In April 2009, we and TEPPCO dissociated from TOPS and recorded a $68.4 million charge to write-off our investment in the joint venture. In September 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with certain affiliates of Oiltanking that resolved all disputes between the parties related to the business and affairs of the TOPS project. We recognized approximately $66.9 million of expense during the third quarter of 2009 in connection with the payment of this cash settlement. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding insurance-related gains and the charges associated with TOPS. In general, natural gas and crude oil drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico ceased as a result of the federal offshore drilling moratorium, which went into effect in May 2010. This resulted in lower throughput volumes available to certain of our offshore pipeline and platform assets. The moratorium was lifted in October 2010; however, we are uncertain as to when oil and gas drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico will return to pre-moratorium levels. For additional information regarding the federal offshore drilling moratorium, see page 63 of Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.” Gross operating margin from our offshore crude oil pipeline business was $97.9 million for 2010 compared to $79.3 million for 2009, an $18.6 million year-to-year increase. Equity earnings from Poseidon increased $5.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes and lower operating expenses. In addition, gross operating margin from our Shenzi crude oil pipeline, which commenced operations in April 2009, increased $4.0 million year-to-year. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our crude oil pipelines increased $8.9 million year-to-year primarily due to increased transportation volumes. Certain of these pipelines were either in limited service or out-of-service completely during 2009 due to the lingering effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike on energy infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the effects of the federal offshore drilling moratorium, total offshore crude oil transportation volumes averaged 320 MBPD during 2010 compared to 308 MBPD during 2009. Gross operating margin from our offshore natural gas pipeline business was $45.5 million for 2010 compared to $54.2 million for 2009, an $8.7 million year-to-year decrease. Total offshore natural gas transportation volumes were 1,242 BBtus/d during 2010 versus 1,420 BBtus/d during 2009. Gross operating margin from our Independence Trail pipeline decreased $31.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower transportation volumes. Natural gas transportation volumes on our Independence Trail pipeline decreased to 576 BBtus/d during 2010 from 805 BBtus/d during 2009 as a result of well depletion and lost production (i.e., wells that were shut-in or watered-out) and indirect impacts of the federal offshore drilling moratorium. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our offshore natural gas pipelines increased $22.5 million year-to-year primarily due to a year-to-year decrease in operating expenses as a result of property damage repair expenses we recorded during 2009 and revenue increases on our HIOS pipeline system in 2010. 98 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our offshore platform services business was $126.9 million for 2010 compared to $142.6 million for 2009, a $15.7 million decrease year-to-year. Our net platform natural gas processing volumes were 513 MMcf/d during 2010 compared to 700 MMcf/d during 2009. The year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is primarily due to lower natural gas processing volumes at our Independence Hub platform as a result of well depletion and lost production (i.e., wells that were shut-in or watered-out) and indirect impacts of the federal offshore drilling moratorium. Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $584.5 million for 2010 compared to $364.7 million for 2009, a $219.8 million increase year-to-year. Gross operating margin from propylene fractionation and related activities was $212.4 million for 2010 compared to $89.6 million for 2009. The $122.8 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher propylene fractionation volumes and sales margins. Propylene sales margins increased year-to-year as a result of improved consumer demand for propylene derivative products and lower propylene production from ethylene crackers (which impacted supply) during 2010 compared to 2009. Propylene fractionation volumes increased to 77 MBPD during 2010 from 68 MBPD during 2009. Gross operating margin from octane enhancement was $47.0 million for 2010 compared to $11.5 million for 2009. The $35.5 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher sales volumes and margins from motor gasoline additives and revenues from by-product sales. Octane enhancement production volumes were 16 MBPD during 2010 compared to 10 MBPD during 2009. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization was $84.9 million for 2010 compared to $76.2 million for 2009. The $8.7 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher commodity prices, which resulted in increased revenues from by-product sales and more than offset the effect of lower isomerization volumes. Butane isomerization volumes decreased to 89 MBPD during 2010 from 97 MBPD during 2009. Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related activities was $170.8 million for 2010 compared to $124.7 million for 2009, a $46.1 million year-to-year increase. Gross operating margin for 2009 includes a $28.7 million charge recognized by TEPPCO in the third quarter of 2009 in connection with its river terminal business. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our refined products pipelines and related activities increased $17.4 million year-to-year primarily due to the expansion of our refined products marketing activities and the completion of our 5.3 million barrel refined products terminal in Port Arthur, Texas, which generated $7.4 million of gross operating margin for 2010. Pipeline transportation volumes for the refined products business were 734 MBPD during 2010 compared to 682 MBPD during 2009. Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other segment services was $69.4 million for 2010 compared to $62.7 million for 2009, a $6.7 million year-to-year increase. An increase in gross operating margin attributable to earnings from recently acquired and constructed marine vessels was partially offset by higher operating expenses during 2010 as compared to 2009. Other Investments. Gross operating margin from this business segment was a loss of $2.8 million for 2010 compared to income of $41.1 million for 2009, a $43.9 million year-to-year decrease. This segment reflects our noncontrolling ownership interests in Energy Transfer Equity and its general partner, LE GP, which are accounted for using the equity method. In December 2010, we sold our entire membership interest in LE GP and recorded a nominal gain on the transaction. According to financial statements filed with the SEC, Energy Transfer Equity reported operating income of $1.04 billion for 2010 compared to $1.11 billion for 2009, a $73.7 million year-to-year decrease. Operating income from Energy Transfer Equity’s investment in ETP decreased $69.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher maintenance and ad valorem tax expenses and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to acquired or constructed assets. Energy Transfer Equity’s operating income for 2010 includes $14.6 million from its investment in RGNC. Collectively, the remainder of Energy Transfer Equity’s operating income decreased $18.9 million year-to-year primarily due to $12.8 99 Table of Contents million of expenses it incurred during 2010 in connection with its acquisition of interests in RGNC and related transactions. Collectively, all other items included in Energy Transfer Equity’s net income decreased $287.6 million year-to-year. Energy Transfer Equity’s interest expense increased $156.5 million year-to-year, which includes $66.4 million of losses during 2010 related to the termination of interest rate swaps. Energy Transfer Equity’s net income for 2010 also includes losses of $52.4 million associated with the change in fair value of non-hedged interest rate derivatives compared to gains of $33.6 million for 2009. In addition, Energy Transfer Equity’s net income for 2010 includes a $52.6 million non-cash impairment charge recorded by ETP to write down its investment in Midcontinent Express Pipeline LLC to fair value. Collectively, all other items included in Energy Transfer Equity’s net income increased $7.5 million year-to-year. After taking into account noncontrolling interests, income attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer Equity decreased to $192.8 million for 2010 from $442.5 million for 2009. Before the amortization of our excess cost amounts related to this investment, our equity income from Energy Transfer Equity and its general partner was a collective $33.5 million for 2010 versus $77.7 million for 2009. Our equity income from these investments was reduced by $36.3 million and $36.6 million of excess cost amortization during 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional information regarding our investment in Energy Transfer Equity, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2009 with Year Ended December 31, 2008 Revenues for 2009 were $25.51 billion compared to $35.47 billion for 2008. The $9.96 billion year-to-year decrease in consolidated revenues is primarily due to lower energy commodity sales prices during 2009 relative to 2008. This factor accounted for a $10.01 billion year-to-year decrease in consolidated revenues associated with our marketing activities. Collectively, the remainder of our consolidated revenues increased $47.9 million year-to-year primarily due to improved results from our offshore activities. Operating costs and expenses were $23.57 billion for 2009 compared to $33.62 billion for 2008, a $10.05 billion year-to-year decrease. The cost of sales of our marketing activities decreased $9.59 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower energy commodity sales prices. Likewise, the operating costs and expenses of our natural gas processing plants decreased $700.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower PTR costs attributable to the decline in energy commodity prices. Consolidated operating costs and expenses for 2009 include aggregate charges of $135.3 million related to our dissociation from TOPS and $28.7 million of expenses incurred by TEPPCO in connection with its river terminal business. We recorded $33.5 million of non-cash asset impairment charges during 2009, which includes $22.8 million incurred by TEPPCO related to its refined products terminals. Consolidated operating costs and expenses for 2008 include $49.1 million of repair expenses for property damage sustained by our assets as a result of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Collectively, the remainder of our consolidated operating costs and expenses increased $92.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher depreciation expense recorded during 2009. Changes in our revenues and operating costs and expenses year-to-year are primarily explained by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.85 per gallon during 2009 versus $1.40 per gallon during 2008 – a 39% decrease year-to-year. The Henry Hub market price of natural gas averaged $3.99 per MMBtu during 2009 versus $9.04 per MMBtu during 2008 – a 56% decrease year-to-year. The NYMEX crude oil market price averaged $61.88 per barrel during 2009 compared to $99.73 per barrel during 2008 – a 38% decrease year-to-year. General and administrative costs increased $38.0 million year-to-year primarily due to $31.0 million of expenses we incurred during 2009 in connection with the TEPPCO Merger. Equity in income of our unconsolidated affiliates was $92.3 million for 2009 compared to $66.2 million for 2008, a $26.1 million year-to-year increase. Collectively, equity in income from our 100 Table of Contents investments in Cameron Highway and Poseidon increased $13.8 million year-to-year due to higher crude oil transportation volumes. Equity in income from our investments in White River Hub, LLC (“White River Hub”) and Skelly-Belvieu increased $3.1 million and $1.9 million year-to-year, respectively. The assets owned by White River Hub began commercial operations in December 2008. We acquired a 49% equity interest in Skelly-Belvieu during December 2008. Equity in income from our Marco Polo platform decreased $13.3 million year-to-year primarily due to the expiration of demand fee revenues during March 2009. The Marco Polo platform is owned through our investment in Deepwater Gateway. Equity in income from our investments in Energy Transfer Equity and LE GP increased $9.8 million year-to-year. Collectively, equity in income of our other investments increased $10.8 million year-to-year largely due to improved results from our investments in midstream energy companies operating in southern Louisiana. Operating income for 2009 was $1.85 billion compared to $1.77 billion for 2008. Collectively, the aforementioned changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates contributed to the $82.5 million year-to-year increase in operating income. Interest expense increased to $687.3 million for 2009 from $608.3 million for 2008. The $79.0 million year-to-year increase in interest expense is primarily due to EPO’s issuance of Senior Notes M, N and O during 2008 and a $37.6 million decrease in capitalized interest during 2009 relative to 2008. Average debt principal outstanding increased to $13.0 billion during 2009 from $11.27 billion during 2008 primarily due to debt incurred to fund growth capital investments. Provision for income taxes decreased $5.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower expenses associated with the Texas Margin Tax, partially offset by a one-time charge of $6.6 million associated with taxable gains arising from Dixie’s sale of certain assets during 2009. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, our consolidated net income decreased $4.8 million year-to-year to $1.14 billion for 2009 compared to $1.15 billion for 2008. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $936.2 million for 2009 compared to $981.1 million for 2008. Net income attributable to partners increased $40.1 million year-to-year to $204.1 million for 2009 compared to $164.0 million for 2008. In general, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike had an adverse effect on our operations in the Gulf of Mexico and along the U.S. Gulf Coast during 2008. Storm-related disruptions in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production in these regions resulted in reduced volumes available to our pipeline systems, natural gas processing plants, NGL fractionators and offshore platforms, which in turn caused a decrease in gross operating margin for certain operations. In addition, property damage caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike resulted in lower revenues caused by facility downtime as well as higher operating costs and expenses at certain of our plants and pipelines. As a result of our allocated share of EPCO’s insurance deductibles for windstorm coverage, gross operating margin for 2008 includes $49.1 million of repair expenses for property damage sustained by our assets as a result of the hurricanes. We estimate that gross operating margin from our consolidated operations was reduced by approximately $81.0 million during 2008 (i.e., lost business opportunities) as a result of supply interruptions and facility downtime caused by the effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. For more information regarding our insurance program and claims related to these storms, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services.

Results for 2009 include $5.9 million of gains related to insurance proceeds compared to $1.1 million of such proceeds in 2008. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding the gains from insurance proceeds. 101 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business was $947.9 million for 2009 compared to $815.3 million for 2008, a $132.6 million year-to-year increase. Equity NGL production increased to 117 MBPD during 2009 from 108 MBPD during 2008. The Meeker and Pioneer facilities and related hedging program contributed $104.7 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin due to higher volumes and improved processing margins. These Rocky Mountain natural gas processing plants produced 60 MBPD of equity NGLs during 2009 compared to 49 MBPD during 2008. During 2009, we significantly increased the volume of forward sales transactions in connection with our NGL marketing activities, which resulted in higher sales margins and increased utilization of certain of our pipeline and storage facilities. Our NGL marketing activities contributed $95.7 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our natural gas processing activities decreased $67.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower NGL sales margins and equity NGL production volumes in Texas and New Mexico. Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage business was $538.9 million for 2009 compared to $397.4 million for 2008, a $141.5 million year-to-year increase. Total NGL transportation volumes increased to 2,196 MBPD during 2009 from 2,021 MBPD during 2008. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America and Seminole Pipeline Systems increased $85.7 million year-to-year, which reflected a $29.2 million benefit in 2009 related to a rate case settlement for the Mid-America Pipeline System, an increase in the system-wide tariff, higher volumes and lower fuel costs. Gross operating margin from our NGL import/export terminal and related pipeline increased $20.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher export volumes. Our Mont Belvieu storage complex contributed $14.9 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin due to higher volumes and fees. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our NGL pipelines and related storage assets increased $20.6 million year-to-year primarily due to improved results from our south Louisiana assets. Gross operating margin from our NGL fractionation business was $136.0 million for 2009 compared to $111.2 million for 2008. Gross operating margin from this business increased $24.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower fuel costs and higher NGL fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu and south Louisiana fractionators during 2009 compared to 2008. Fractionation volumes were 461 MBPD during 2009 compared to 441 MBPD during 2008. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $501.5 million for 2009 compared to $589.9 million for 2008, an $88.4 million year-to-year decrease.

Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System decreased $14.4 million year-to-year. Earnings from the Sherman Extension pipeline of our Texas Intrastate System during 2009 were more than offset by a year-to-year increase in operating costs and expenses and lower revenues from the sale of condensate. Our Jonah Gathering System contributed a $17.0 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin primarily due to higher natural gas gathering volumes. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our onshore natural gas pipelines and related marketing activities increased $1.8 million year-to-year primarily due to improved results from natural gas marketing activities during 2009 compared to 2008. Gross operating margin from our natural gas storage business was $53.0 million for 2009 compared to $39.4 million for 2008. The $13.6 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to increased storage activity at our Petal natural gas storage facility and improved results at our Wilson facility. We placed an additional natural gas storage cavern in operation during the third quarter of 2008 at our Petal facility, which provided an incremental 4.2 Bcf of subscribed capacity. 102 Table of Contents Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $164.4 million for 2009 compared to $132.2 million for 2008, a $32.2 million year-to-year increase. Total onshore crude oil transportation volumes were 680 MBPD during 2009 compared to 696 MBPD during 2008. Gross operating margin from crude oil marketing activities increased $36.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes and margins during 2009 relative to 2008. Collectively, gross operating margin from our crude oil terminals in Cushing, Oklahoma and Midland, Texas increased $3.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher storage revenues and throughput volumes. Gross operating margin from the remainder of our onshore crude oil pipelines decreased $8.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower volumes and higher operating expenses on our South Texas System and lower equity in income from our investment in Seaway. The pipeline assets owned by Seaway experienced lower volumes and average fees during 2009 compared to 2008. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $180.5 million for 2009 compared to $187.0 million for 2008, a $6.5 million year-to-year decrease. Results for 2009 include $39.7 million of gains related to insurance proceeds compared to $0.2 million of such gains in 2008. Results for 2009 include $135.3 million of aggregate charges related to our dissociation from TOPS. As discussed in the following paragraphs, gross operating margin from this business segment increased $89.3 million year-to-year excluding the effects of gains from insurance proceeds and charges related to TOPS. Gross operating margin from our offshore crude oil pipeline business was $79.3 million for 2009 compared to $35.1 million for 2008. The $44.2 million year-to-year increase was primarily due to the start-up of our Shenzi crude oil pipeline in April 2009 and higher transportation volumes on the crude oil pipeline systems owned by Cameron Highway and Poseidon. Total offshore crude oil transportation volumes were 308 MBPD during 2009 versus 169 MBPD during 2008. Gross operating margin from our offshore natural gas pipeline business was $54.2 million for 2009 compared to $6.9 million for 2008, a $47.3 million year-to-year increase. Offshore natural gas transportation volumes were 1,420 BBtus/d during 2009 versus 1,408 BBtus/d during 2008. Gross operating margin from our Independence Trail pipeline for 2009 increased $39.8 million over 2008. Results for the Independence Trail Pipeline for 2008 were negatively impacted by expenses and downtime associated with flex joint repairs. Collectively, gross operating margin from our other offshore natural gas pipelines increased $7.5 million year-to-year primarily due to hurricane-related property damage repair expenses during 2008. Gross operating margin from our offshore platform services business was $142.6 million for 2009 compared to $144.8 million for 2008, a $2.2 million year-to-year decrease. Gross operating margin from our Independence Hub platform increased $12.1 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in natural gas processing volumes during 2009. Our Independence Hub platform experienced reduced volumes and downtime during 2008 in connection with flex joint repairs on the Independence Trail Pipeline. Collectively, gross operating margin from our other offshore platforms and related assets decreased $14.3 million year-to-year primarily due to (i) lower natural gas and crude oil processing volumes at our Marco Polo platform as a result of prolonged hurricane-related operational disruptions and (ii) the expiration of demand fee revenues at our Marco Polo and Falcon platforms. On a net basis, platform natural gas processing volumes increased to 700 MMcf/d during 2009 compared to 632 MMcf/d during 2008 and platform crude oil processing volumes decreased to 12 MBPD during 2009 compared to 15 MBPD during 2008. Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $364.7 million for 2009 compared to $374.9 million for 2008, a $10.2 million year-to-year decrease. Gross operating margin from octane enhancement was $11.5 million for 2009 compared to a loss of $11.3 million for 2008, a $22.8 million year-to-year increase. Gross operating margin for 2008 was negatively impacted by facility downtime, reduced volumes and higher operating expenses as a result of operational issues and the effects of Hurricane Ike. 103 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from propylene fractionation and related activities was $89.6 million for 2009 compared to $87.2 million for 2008. The $2.4 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is largely due to higher propylene sales volumes during 2009 relative to 2008. Propylene fractionation volumes increased to 68 MBPD during 2009 from 58 MBPD during 2008. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization was $76.2 million for 2009 compared to $95.9 million for 2008. The $19.7 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is attributable to lower revenues from the sale of plant by-products due to lower commodity prices. Butane isomerization volumes increased to 97 MBPD during 2009 from 86 MBPD during 2008. Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related activities was $124.7 million for 2009 compared to $132.9 million for 2008, an $8.2 million year-to-year decrease. Gross operating margin for 2009 includes $28.7 million of expense to accrue a liability for pipeline transportation deficiency fees owed to a third-party. Gross operating margin from the remainder of this business increased $20.5 million primarily due to increased revenue from product sales, lower operating expenses and higher average fees on our Products Pipeline System during 2009 relative to 2008. Transportation volumes on our refined products pipelines were 682 MBPD during 2009 compared to 702 MBPD during 2008. Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other services was $62.7 million for 2009 compared to $70.2 million for 2008, a $7.5 million year-to-year decrease. Gross operating margin from marine transportation decreased $4.8 million year-to-year due to higher operating expenses and lower day rate revenues during 2009 relative to 2008. These factors more than offset gross operating margin generated by the acquisition of 19 push boats and 28 barges in June 2009. Gross operating margin from the distribution of lubrication oils and specialty chemicals decreased $2.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower margins from the sale of specialty chemicals and higher operating expense during 2009 compared to 2008. Other Investments. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $41.1 million for 2009 compared to $31.3 million for 2008, a $9.8 million year-to-year increase. This segment reflects our noncontrolling ownership interests in Energy Transfer Equity and LE GP, both of which are accounted for using the equity method. According to financial statements filed with the SEC, Energy Transfer Equity reported operating income of $1.11 billion for 2009 compared to $1.10 billion for 2008, for an $11.5 million year-to-year increase. The increase in Energy Transfer Equity’s operating income is primarily due to improved retail propane sales margins including the impact of hedging activities, contributions from recently completed growth capital projects (e.g., ETP’s Phoenix project and increased intrastate pipeline transportation capacity) and lower fuel costs. The year-to-year increase in operating income attributable to the foregoing was partially offset by lower fuel retention revenues (associated with ETP’s intrastate transportation and storage operating activities) as a result of lower average natural gas prices during 2009 relative to 2008. Collectively, all other items included in Energy Transfer Equity’s net income increased $6.6 million year-to-year primarily due to changes in the fair value of non-hedged interest rate derivatives, the benefit of which was partially offset by a year-to-year increase in interest expense due to borrowings used to finance growth capital projects. After taking into account noncontrolling interests, income attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer Equity increased to $442.5 million for 2009 from $375.0 million for 2008. Before the amortization of excess cost amounts, our equity income from Energy Transfer Equity and its general partner was a collective $77.7 million for 2009 versus $65.6 million for 2008. Our equity income from these investments was reduced by $36.6 million and $34.3 million of excess cost amortization during 2009 and 2008, respectively. For additional information regarding our investment in Energy Transfer Equity, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 104 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2010, we had $65.5 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $1.79 billion of available credit under our revolving credit facilities, including the available borrowing capacity of our consolidated subsidiaries such as Duncan Energy Partners. Our primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses and debt service, are for working capital, capital expenditures, business acquisitions and distributions to partners. We expect to fund our short-term needs for operating expenses and sustaining capital expenditures using operating cash flows and revolving credit arrangements. Capital expenditures for long-term needs resulting from business expansion projects and acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources (either separately or in combination) including operating cash flows, borrowings under credit facilities, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities and proceeds from divestitures of ownership interests in assets. We expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash flows. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and/or refinancing arrangements. It is our belief that we will continue to have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund future recurring operating and investing activities. We had approximately $13.53 billion in principal outstanding under consolidated debt agreements at December 31, 2010. In May 2010, EPO issued an aggregate of $2.0 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes. EPO issued (i) $400.0 million in principal amount of 5-year senior unsecured notes (“Senior Notes X”) at 99.79% of their principal amount, (ii) $1.0 billion in principal amount of 10-year senior unsecured notes (“Senior Notes Y”) at 99.701% of their principal amount and (iii) $600.0 million in principal amount of 30-year senior unsecured notes (“Senior Notes Z”) at 99.525% of their principal amount. Net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes were used (i) to repay EPO’s Senior Notes K in June 2010, (ii) to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) for general company purposes. EPO had borrowed $850.0 million under its Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to complete the State Line and Fairplay systems acquisitions in May 2010. In June 2010, EPO entered into the Amended Acadian LLC Agreement with Duncan Energy Partners. This document reflects the agreement between Duncan Energy Partners and EPO regarding funding arrangements for the Haynesville Extension. This expansion capital project will extend our south Louisiana intrastate natural gas pipeline system, which is owned by Acadian Gas, LLC, into northwest Louisiana and the Haynesville Shale production area. Duncan Energy Partners will fund 66% of the Haynesville Extension project costs and EPO will fund the remaining 34% of such expenditures. The total budgeted cost of the Haynesville Extension project is approximately $1.56 billion (including capitalized interest), with Duncan Energy Partners’ share currently estimated at $1.03 billion. In order to fund its capital spending requirements under the Haynesville Extension project, Duncan Energy Partners entered into new senior unsecured credit facilities having an aggregate borrowing capacity of $1.25 billion in October 2010. In January 2011, EPO issued an aggregate of $1.5 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes. EPO issued $750.0 million in principal amount of 5-year senior unsecured notes (“Senior Notes AA”) at 99.901% of their principal amount and $750.0 million in principal amount of 30-year senior unsecured notes (“Senior Notes BB”) at 99.317% of their principal amount. Net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes AA and BB were used (i) to repay $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes B that matured in February 2011, (ii) to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) for general company purposes. For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Registration Statements We may issue additional equity or debt securities to assist us in meeting our future liquidity and capital spending requirements. Duncan Energy Partners may do likewise in meeting its future liquidity and capital spending requirements. In August 2007, we filed a universal shelf registration statement (the “2007 Shelf”) with the SEC that allowed us to issue an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities. In July 105 Table of Contents 2010, we filed a new universal shelf registration statement (the “2010 Shelf”) with the SEC that replaced the 2007 Shelf, which was set to expire in August 2010. Like the 2007 Shelf, the 2010 Shelf allows us to issue an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities. The following tables present information regarding our equity and debt offerings made under the 2007 Shelf during 2010. Net cash proceeds from equity offerings under the 2007 Shelf are a component of noncontrolling interest as presented on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows and Statements of Consolidated Equity included under Item 8 of this annual report. Dollar amounts presented in the tables are in millions, except offering unit price amounts. Underwritten Equity Offering Number of Common Units Issued Offering Unit Price Total Net Cash Proceeds January 2010 underwritten offering (1) 10,925,000 $ 32.42 $ 350.3 April 2010 underwritten offering (2) 13,800,000 $ 35.55 484.6 Total 24,725,000 $ 834.9 (1) Net cash proceeds from this equity offering were used to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and for general company purposes.

Underwritten Equity Offering Number of Common Units Issued Offering Unit Price Total Net Cash Proceeds (in millions) December 2010 (1) 13,225,000 $ 41.25 $ 528.5 (1) Net cash proceeds from this equity offering were used to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and for general partnership purposes. Duncan Energy Partners has a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC that allows it to issue up to $1 billion of debt and equity securities. At December 31, 2010, Duncan Energy Partners could issue approximately $856.4 million of additional equity or debt securities under its registration statement. We have filed registration statements with the SEC authorizing the issuance of up to an aggregate of 70,000,000 common units in connection with our distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”). The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they would otherwise receive into the purchase of additional common units. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we issued 8,204,998 common units in connection with our DRIP, which generated proceeds of $267.7 million from plan participants. Of this amount, affiliates of EPCO accounted for approximately $207.7 million of such reinvestment. In addition to the DRIP, we have filed registration statements with the SEC authorizing the issuance of up to an aggregate of 1,200,000 common units in connection with our employee unit purchase plan. Under this plan, employees of EPCO can purchase our common units at a 10% discount through payroll deductions. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we issued 173,055 common units to employees under this plan, which generated proceeds of $6.1 million. 106 Table of Contents For information regarding our public debt obligations or partnership equity, see Notes 12 and 13, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Letter of Credit Facilities At December 31, 2010, EPO had a $50.0 million letter of credit outstanding related to its commodity derivative instruments and a $58.3 million letter of credit outstanding related to its Petal GO Zone Bonds. These letter of credit facilities do not reduce the amount available for borrowing under EPO’s credit facilities. EPO also had an $85.0 million letter of credit outstanding at December 31, 2010, which reduced the amount available for borrowing under its Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. Credit Ratings At March 1, 2011, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s senior unsecured debt securities were: Baa3 from Moody’s Investor Services (“Moody’s”); BBB- from Fitch Ratings; and BBB- from Standard and Poor’s. In April 2010, Standard and Poor’s reaffirmed its corporate credit rating of EPO, revised its outlook for EPO’s business from “stable” to “positive,” and updated its business risk assessment from “satisfactory” to “strong.” EPO’s credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. Based on the debt and equity characteristics of EPO’s $1.53 billion of junior subordinated notes (a type of hybrid security), the rating agencies assigned partial equity treatment to such notes. The ratings agencies use this treatment to adjust their credit metrics to gain a clearer economic view of the debt and equity components of our capitalization. Standard and Poor’s assigns 50% equity treatment to the junior subordinated notes and Fitch Ratings assigns a 75% equity treatment. In July 2010, Moody’s announced revisions to their classification system for hybrid securities. Moody’s reduced the equity credit that it assigns to securities such as EPO’s junior subordinated notes from 50% to 25%. We do not believe this revision will affect EPO’s investment-grade Baa3 senior unsecured debt rating from Moody’s. A downgrade of EPO’s credit ratings could result in our being required to post financial collateral in connection with our guaranty of Centennial’s debt, which was $55.5 million at December 31, 2010. Furthermore, from time to time we may enter into contracts in connection with our commodity and interest rate hedging activities that may require the posting of financial collateral if EPO’s credit ratings were to be downgraded below investment grade. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented (dollars in millions). For information regarding the individual components of our cash flow amounts, see the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Item 8 of this annual report. For Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 2,300.0 $ 2,410.3 $ 1,566.4 Cash used in investing activities 3,251.6 1,547.7 3,246.9 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 961.1 (863.9 ) 1,695.9 107 Table of Contents Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our business activities. As a result, these cash flows are exposed to certain risks. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry. We provide services for producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals. The products that we process, sell or transport are principally used as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating; as feedstock in petrochemical manufacturing; and in the production of motor gasoline. Reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers, whether because of a decline in general economic conditions, reduced demand for the end products made with our products, or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons, could have a negative impact on our earnings and operating cash flows. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this annual report. Our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method. The indirect method derives net cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income to remove (i) the effects of all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments, such as changes during the period in inventory, deferred income and similar transactions, (ii) the effects of all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and cash payments, such as changes during the period in receivables and payables, (iii) other non-cash amounts such as depreciation, amortization, operating lease expenses paid by EPCO, changes in the fair market value of derivative instruments and equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates (net cash flows provided by operating activities reflect the actual cash distributions we receive from such investees), and (iv) the effects of all items classified as investing or financing cash flows, such as proceeds from asset sales and related transactions or extinguishment of debt. In general, the net effect of changes in operating accounts results from the timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for purchases and other expenses during each period. Increases or decreases in inventory are influenced by the quantity of products held in connection with our marketing activities and changes in energy commodity prices. Cash used in investing activities primarily represents expenditures for additions to property, plant and equipment, business combinations and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Cash provided by or used in financing activities generally consists of borrowings and repayments of debt, distributions to partners and noncontrolling interests and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities (particularly to noncontrolling interests). Amounts presented in our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for borrowings and repayments under debt agreements are influenced by the magnitude of cash receipts and payments under our revolving credit facilities. The following information highlights the significant year-to-year variances in our cash flow amounts: Comparison of 2010 with 2009 Operating Activities. The $110.3 million decrease in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following: § Net cash flows from consolidated operations (excluding distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates, cash payments for interest and cash payments for income taxes) decreased $75.4 million year-to-year. The decrease in operating cash flow is generally due to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in our operating accounts, partially offset by increased profitability (e.g., our gross operating margin increased $372.1 million year-to-year). § Distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates increased $22.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher distributions received from Poseidon and Promix. In February 2010, we also began receiving distributions from Skelly-Belvieu. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our unconsolidated affiliates. 108 Table of Contents § Cash payments for interest increased approximately $71.4 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in fixed-rate debt obligations. Our average debt principal outstanding for 2010 was $13.23 billion compared to $13.0 billion for 2009. § Cash payments for income taxes decreased $13.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher payments made during 2009 attributable to the Texas Margin Tax and a taxable gain arising from Dixie’s sale of certain assets. Investing Activities. The $1.7 billion increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: § Cash used for business combinations increased $1.21 billion year-to-year, primarily due to the May 2010 acquisition of the State Line and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems for approximately $1.2 billion. For additional information regarding this transaction, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs, increased $435.6 million year-to-year. For additional information related to our capital spending program, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. § Restricted cash related to our hedging activities increased $35.0 million (a cash outflow) during 2010 due to increases in the margin requirements of our commodity hedging positions. For 2009, restricted cash related to our hedging activities decreased $140.2 million (a cash inflow). § Proceeds from asset sales and related transactions increased $102.3 million year-to-year primarily due to insurance proceeds received during the third quarter 2010 related to the disposition of assets and the sale of our entire membership interest in LE GP in December 2010. Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $961.1 million for 2010 compared to cash used in financing activities of $863.9 million in 2009. The $1.83 billion change in financing activities was primarily due to the following: § Net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements increased $1.41 billion year-to-year. During 2010, EPO issued $2.0 billion in senior notes (Senior Notes X, Y and Z) offset by the repayment of its $500.0 million of Senior Notes K and $54.0 million Pascagoula Mississippi Business Finance Corporation Loan. In October 2010, Duncan Energy Partners borrowed $400 million under its new term loan to repay and terminate a revolving credit facility and an intercompany note. In general, the amount of indebtedness for Duncan Energy Partners is increasing due to borrowings to fund its obligations in connection with the Haynesville Extension project. For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Cash distributions paid to partners (i.e., the unitholders of Holdings prior to the Holdings Merger) increased $41.0 million year-to-year due to increases in Holdings’ quarterly distribution rates and the number of distribution-bearing units outstanding. § Cash distributions paid to noncontrolling interests increased $156.3 million year-to-year primarily due to increases in the number of Enterprise common units outstanding and its quarterly distribution rates, partially offset by the cessation of cash distributions to the former owners of TEPPCO in connection with the TEPPCO Merger. § Cash contributions from noncontrolling interests increased $89.5 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in the offering prices of Enterprise’s common units in connection with its equity offerings in 2010 compared to those in 2009. In addition, Duncan Energy Partners issued common units in 2009, which generated $137.4 million in proceeds. 109 Table of Contents § Net cash proceeds from the issuance of our common units in December 2010, following the Holdings Merger, were $528.5 million. Comparison of 2009 with 2008 Operating Activities. The $843.9 million increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following: § Net cash flows from consolidated operations (excluding distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates, cash payments for interest and cash payments for income taxes) increased $888.7 million year-to-year. The increase in operating cash flow is generally due to increased profitability and the timing of related cash receipts and disbursements. The total year-to-year increase also reflects a $68.9 million increase in cash proceeds from hurricane-related insurance claims. For information regarding cash proceeds from business interruption and property damage insurance claims, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates increased $12.1 million year-to-year, including a $6.2 million increase in distributions received from Energy Transfer Equity. § Cash payments for interest increased $56.9 million year-to-year primarily due to increased borrowings to finance our capital spending program. Our average debt principal outstanding for 2009 was $13.0 billion compared to $11.27 billion for 2008. § Cash payments for income taxes increased $22.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher payments made in 2009 for the Texas Margin tax and a taxable gain arising from the sale of certain assets by Dixie. Investing Activities. The $1.7 billion decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: § Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs, decreased $945.9 million year-to-year. For additional information related to our capital spending program, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. § Cash used for business combinations decreased $446.2 million year-to-year. For additional information regarding our business combinations in 2009 and 2008, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Restricted cash related to our hedging activities decreased $140.2 million (a cash inflow) during 2009 primarily due to a reduction in margin requirements related to derivative instruments we utilized. For 2008, restricted cash related to our hedging activities increased $132.8 million (a cash outflow). Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities was $863.9 million for 2009 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1.7 billion in 2008. The $2.56 billion change in financing activities was primarily due to the following: § Net repayments under our consolidated debt agreements of $272.5 million in 2009 compared to net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements of $2.74 billion in 2008. During 2008, EPO and TEPPCO issued a combined $2.6 billion in principal amount of senior notes. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 110 Table of Contents § Cash distributions paid to partners (i.e., the unitholders of Holdings prior to the Holdings Merger) increased $53.6 million year-to-year primarily due to increases in Holdings’ quarterly distribution rates. § Distributions paid to noncontrolling interests increased $140.0 million year-to-year primarily due to increases in the number of units outstanding and quarterly distribution rates of Enterprise, TEPPCO (prior to the TEPPCO Merger), and Duncan Energy Partners. . § Contributions from noncontrolling interests increased $567.8 million year-to-year primarily due to net cash proceeds that Enterprise and Duncan Energy Partners received from common unit offerings in 2009. Capital Spending An integral part of our business strategy involves expansion through business combinations, growth capital projects and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are positioned to continue to grow our system of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas and/or crude oil production from resource basins in the Rocky Mountains and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, including the Barnett Shale, Haynesville Shale and Eagle Ford Shale producing regions. Management continues to analyze potential acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. In past years, major oil and gas companies have sold non-strategic assets in the midstream energy sector in which we operate. We believe this trend will continue, and expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestitures. The following table summarizes our capital spending for the periods presented (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Capital spending for business combinations: State Line and Fairplay Systems acquisition $ 1,214.5 $ -- $ -- Great Divide Gathering System acquisition -- -- 125.2 Cenac and Horizon acquisition -- -- 345.7 Other business combinations 99.4 107.3 82.6 Total 1,313.9 107.3 553.5 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net: (1) Growth capital projects (2) 1,766.2 1,373.9 2,249.5 Sustaining capital projects (3) 235.9 192.6 262.9 Total 2,002.1 1,566.5 2,512.4 Capital spending for intangible assets: Acquisition of intangible assets -- 1.4 5.8 Capital spending attributable to unconsolidated affiliates: Investments in unconsolidated affiliates 8.0 19.6 64.7 Total capital spending $ 3,324.0 $ 1,694.8 $ 3,136.4 (1) On certain of our capital projects, third parties are obligated to reimburse us for all or a portion of project expenditures. The majority of such arrangements are associated with projects related to pipeline construction and production well tie-ins. Contributions in aid of construction costs were $38.7 million, $17.8 million and $27.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table are presented net of related contributions in aid of construction costs. (2) Growth capital projects either result in additional revenue streams from existing assets or expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to and major renewals of existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues. 111 Table of Contents Based on information currently available, we estimate our consolidated capital spending for 2011 will be approximately $3.7 billion, which includes estimated expenditures of $3.4 billion for growth capital projects and acquisitions and $260.0 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our forecast of consolidated capital expenditures is based on our currently announced strategic operating and growth plans, which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or from other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, issuance of equity, and potential divestitures of certain assets to third and/or related parties. Our forecast of capital expenditures may change due to factors beyond our control, such as weather related issues, changes in supplier prices or adverse economic conditions. Furthermore, our forecast may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include unforeseen acquisition opportunities. Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a principal factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we currently intend to make the forecasted expenditures discussed above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital markets. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $795.7 million in purchase commitments outstanding that relate to our capital spending for property, plant and equipment. These commitments primarily relate to construction projects at our Mont Belvieu complex and those involving our natural gas pipeline projects in the Eagle Ford Shale, Haynesville Shale and Piceance Basin. Pipeline Integrity Costs Our pipelines are subject to pipeline safety programs administered by the DOT. This federal agency has issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines (which include NGL, crude oil, refined products and petrochemical pipelines) and natural gas pipelines. In general, these regulations require companies to assess the condition of their pipelines in certain high consequence areas (as defined by the regulation) and to perform any necessary repairs. The following table summarizes our pipeline integrity costs, including those attributable to DOT regulations, for the periods presented (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Expensed $ 39.4 $ 44.9 $ 55.4 Capitalized 40.4 37.7 86.2 Total $ 79.8 $ 82.6 $ 141.6 We expect the cost of our pipeline integrity program, irrespective of whether such costs are capitalized or expensed, to approximate $93.3 million in 2011. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting process, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following describes the estimation risk currently underlying our most significant financial statement items: 112 Table of Contents Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Our estimate of depreciation expense incorporates management assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in-service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include: § changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset; § changes in technology that render an asset obsolete; § changes in expected salvage values; or § significant changes in the forecast life of proved reserves of applicable resource basins, if any. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was $19.33 billion and $17.69 billion, respectively. We recorded $745.7 million, $678.1 million and $595.9 million in depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Notes 2 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil or refined products. Long-lived assets with carrying values that are not expected to be recovered through forecast future cash flows are written-down to their estimated fair values. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Our estimates of such undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated salvage values. An impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is based on a series of assumptions similar to those used to derive undiscounted cash flows. Those assumptions also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes, market values and replacement cost estimates. An equity method investment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible loss in value of the investment other than a temporary decline. Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee’s industry. Equity method investments with carrying values that are not expected to be recovered through expected future cash flows are written down to their estimated fair values. The carrying value of an equity method investment is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of discounted estimated cash flows expected to be derived from the investment. This estimate of discounted cash flows is based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment. A significant change in these underlying assumptions could result in our recording an impairment charge. 113 Table of Contents During 2010 and 2009, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment of $8.4 million and $29.4 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. No such non-cash asset impairment charges were recorded in 2008. For additional information regarding impairment charges associated with our long-lived assets and equity method investments, see Notes 6 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Amortization Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Qualifying Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential intangible assets include intellectual property, such as technology, patents, trademarks and trade names, customer contracts and relationships, and non-compete agreements, as well as other intangible assets. The method used to value each intangible asset will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. Our customer relationship intangible assets primarily represent customer bases we acquired in connection with business combinations. The value we assigned to these customer relationships is being amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits of the underlying oil and natural gas resource bases from which the customers produce are estimated to be consumed or otherwise used. Our estimate of the useful life of each resource base is predicated on a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. Our contract-based intangible assets represent the rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement or the natural gas transportation contracts of our Val Verde and Jonah systems. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated useful life (or term), which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of an entity. Our estimates of useful life are based on a number of factors, including: § the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., fractionation facility, pipeline or other asset); § any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights; and § any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such agreements. If our underlying assumptions regarding the estimated useful life of an intangible asset change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset’s unamortized cost is not recoverable due to impairment; we would be required to reduce the asset’s carrying value to fair value. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was $1.84 billion and $1.06 billion, respectively. We recorded $137.6 million, $119.9 million and $130.0 million in amortization expense associated with our intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 114 Table of Contents Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase prices we paid for certain businesses over their respective fair values. We do not amortize goodwill; however, we test our goodwill for impairment at the beginning of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Our goodwill testing involves determining the fair value of the associated reporting unit. These fair value amounts are based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the businesses that make up the reporting unit. Such assumptions include: § discrete financial forecasts for the businesses contained within the reporting unit, which rely on management’s estimates of operating margins, throughput volumes and similar factors; § long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and § appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of the reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a charge to earnings is required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its implied fair value. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment testing, each reporting unit’s fair value was substantially in excess of its carrying value (i.e., by at least 10%). At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of our goodwill was $2.11 billion and $2.02 billion, respectively. We recorded goodwill impairment charges of $1.3 million during 2009. No such impairment charges were recorded in 2010 or 2008. For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Our Revenue Recognition Policies and Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses In general, we recognize revenue from customers when all of the following criteria are met: § persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; § delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; § the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable; and § collectibility is reasonably assured. We record revenue when sales contracts are settled (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed). For additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. We record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts as required by our established policy. Our use of estimates for certain revenues and expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third-party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of such use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for a specific period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of 115 Table of Contents operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. If the assumptions underlying our estimates prove to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. We review our estimates based on currently available information. Reserves for Environmental Matters Our business activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations may, in certain instances, require us to remediate current or former operating sites where specified substances have been released or disposed of. We accrue reserves for environmental matters when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments are based on studies, as well as site surveys, to determine the extent of any environmental damage and the necessary requirements to remediate this damage. Future environmental developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws and additional claims for damages to property, employees and other persons resulting from current or past operations, could result in substantial additional costs beyond our current reserves. In accruing for environmental remediation liabilities, costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to their present value, unless the amount and timing of the expenditures are fixed or reliably determinable. At December 31, 2010, none of our estimated environmental remediation liabilities were discounted to present value since the ultimate amount and timing of cash payments for such liabilities were not readily determinable. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had a liability for environmental remediation of $12.4 million and $16.7 million, respectively, which was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon studies and site surveys. We have recorded our best estimate of the cost of remediation activities. See Notes 2 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding environmental matters. Natural Gas Imbalances In the natural gas pipeline transportation business, volumetric imbalances frequently result from differences in natural gas received from and delivered to customers. Such differences occur when a customer delivers more or less gas into our pipelines than is physically redelivered back to them during a particular time period. The vast majority of such settlements are through in-kind arrangements whereby an imbalance volume is incrementally delivered to or received from a customer over several periods. In some cases, settlements of imbalances accumulated over a period of time are ultimately cashed out at negotiated values which approximate average market prices over a period of time. For those gas imbalances that are ultimately settled over future periods, we estimate the value of such current assets and liabilities using average market prices, which we believe is representative of the value of the imbalances upon final settlement. Changes in natural gas prices may impact our estimates. The following table presents our natural gas imbalance receivables/payables at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): December 31, 2010 2009 Natural gas imbalance receivables (1) $ 22.8 $ 24.1 Natural gas imbalance payables (2) 31.9 19.0 (1) Reflected as a component of “Accounts and notes receivable – trade” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included under Item 8 of this annual report.

Insurance Matters We participate as a named insured in EPCO’s insurance program, which provides us with property damage, business interruption and other coverage, the scope and amounts of which we believe are customary and prudent for the nature and extent of our operations. For additional information regarding insurance matters, see Note 19 of the Notes Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 117 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 (dollars in millions): Payment or Settlement due by Period Less than 1-3 4-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1) $ 13,526.5 $ 732.3 $ 3,354.0 $ 1,800.0 $ 7,640.2 Estimated cash payments for interest (2) $ 13,502.5 $ 753.8 $ 1,328.3 $ 1,047.7 $ 10,372.7 Operating lease obligations (3) $ 375.8 $ 48.2 $ 84.6 $ 57.2 $ 185.8 Purchase obligations: (4) Product purchase commitments: Estimated payment obligations: Natural gas $ 1,586.6 $ 806.2 $ 358.0 $ 153.6 $ 268.8 NGLs $ 5,331.8 $ 2,597.8 $ 1,992.5 $ 734.1 $ 7.4 Crude oil $ 450.8 $ 450.8 $ -- $ -- $ -- Petrochemicals & refined products $ 501.3 $ 458.3 $ 43.0 $ -- $ -- Other $ 117.6 $ 24.9 $ 26.8 $ 24.8 $ 41.1 Underlying major volume commitments: Natural gas (in BBtus) 375,545 190,304 84,891 36,500 63,850 NGLs (in MBbls) 98,410 49,060 35,751 13,495 104 Crude oil (in MBbls) 5,169 5,169 -- -- -- Petrochemicals & refined products (in MBbls) 5,616 5,094 522 -- -- Service payment commitments (5) $ 656.3 $ 95.2 $ 150.6 $ 127.9 $ 282.6 Capital expenditure commitments (6) $ 795.7 $ 795.7 $ -- $ -- $ -- Other long-term liabilities (7) $ 220.6 $ -- $ 91.3 $ 18.6 $ 110.7 Total $ 37,065.5 $ 6,763.2 $ 7,429.1 $ 3,963.9 $ 18,909.3 (1) Represents our scheduled future maturities of consolidated debt principal obligations. For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Our estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2010. With respect to our variable-rate debt obligations, we applied the weighted-average interest rate paid during 2010 to determine the estimated cash payments. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for the weighted-average variable interest rates charged in 2010 under our credit agreements. In addition, our estimate of cash payments for interest gives effect to interest rate swap agreements that were in place at December 31, 2010. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding these derivative instruments. Our estimated cash payments for interest are significantly influenced by the long-term maturities of our $550.0 million Junior Subordinated Notes A (due August 2066), $682.7 million Junior Subordinated Notes B (due January 2068), $300.0 million Junior Subordinated Notes C (due June 2067) and TEPPCO Junior Subordinated Notes (due June 2067). Our estimated cash payments for interest assume that these subordinated notes are not called prior to their respective maturity dates. We applied the current fixed interest rate through the respective maturity date for each junior subordinated note to determine the estimated cash payments for interest. (3) Primarily represents operating leases for (i) underground caverns for the storage of natural gas and NGLs, (ii) leased office space with affiliates of EPCO and (iii) land held pursuant to right-of-way agreements. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services under the terms of each agreement at December 31, 2010. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2010 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Represents long and short-term commitments to pay service providers primarily for obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts on pipelines we do not directly own. (6) Represents short-term unconditional payment obligations relating to our capital projects, including our share of those of our unconsolidated affiliates, for services to be rendered or products to be delivered. (7) As reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010, other long-term liabilities primarily represent noncurrent portions of asset retirement obligations, deferred revenues and accrued obligations for pipeline transportation deficiency fees and interest rate derivative instruments. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations involving operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 118 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Except for the following information regarding debt obligations of certain unconsolidated affiliates, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements, as described in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The following information summarizes the significant terms of such unconsolidated debt obligations. Poseidon. At December 31, 2010, Poseidon’s debt obligations consisted of $92.0 million outstanding under its $150.0 million variable-rate revolving credit facility. Amounts borrowed under this facility mature in May 2011 and are secured by substantially all of Poseidon’s assets. Poseidon expects to fund the repayment of its revolving credit facility (including accrued interest) with a variety of sources (either separately or in combination) including operating cash flows, refinancing agreements or cash contributions from its joint venture partners. Evangeline. At December 31, 2010, Evangeline’s debt obligations consisted of a $3.2 million subordinated note payable due in 2011. Evangeline expects to fund the repayment of its debt obligations (including accrued interest) using operating cash flows. Centennial. At December 31, 2010, Centennial’s debt obligations consisted of $110.9 million borrowed under a master shelf loan agreement through two private placements, with interest rates ranging from 7.99% to 8.09%. Borrowings under the master shelf agreement mature in May 2024 and are collateralized by substantially all of Centennial’s assets and severally guaranteed by Centennial’s owners. Specifically, we and our joint venture partner in Centennial have each guaranteed one-half of Centennial’s debt obligations. If Centennial were to default on its debt obligations, our estimated payment obligation would be $55.5 million based on amounts outstanding at December 31, 2010. Energy Transfer Equity. At December 31, 2010, Energy Transfer Equity had approximately $9.4 billion of consolidated debt obligations outstanding. The majority of these amounts relate to senior note obligations of Energy Transfer Equity (on a standalone basis), ETP and RGNC and revolving credit agreements of ETP and RGNC. Based on information contained in the SEC filings of Energy Transfer Equity, the future maturities of their consolidated long-term debt at December 31, 2010 are as follows: $35.3 million, 2011; $825.7 million, 2012; $373.1 million, 2013; $729.1 million, 2014; $755.9 million, 2015 and $6.7 billion, thereafter. Related Party Transactions For information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report as well as Item 13 of this annual report. 119 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Reconciliations The following table presents a reconciliation of total segment gross operating margin to operating income and further to income before provision for income taxes for the periods presented (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Total segment gross operating margin $ 3,253.0 $ 2,880.9 $ 2,640.3 Adjustments to reconcile total segment gross operating margin to operating income: Depreciation, amortization and accretion in operating costs and expenses (936.3 ) (809.3 ) (725.4 ) Non-cash asset impairment charges (8.4 ) (33.5 ) -- Operating lease expenses paid by EPCO (0.7 ) (0.7 ) (2.0 ) Gains from asset sales and related transactions in operating costs and expenses 44.4 -- 4.0 General and administrative costs (204.8 ) (182.8 ) (144.8 ) Operating income 2,147.2 1,854.6 1,772.1 Other expense, net (737.4 ) (689.0 ) (596.0 ) Income before provision for income taxes $ 1,409.8 $ 1,165.6 $ 1,176.1 We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. Our non-GAAP financial measure of total segment gross operating margin should not be considered an alternative to GAAP operating income. We define total segment gross operating margin as operating income before: (i) depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses; (ii) non-cash asset impairment charges; (iii) operating lease expenses for which we do not have the payment obligation (e.g., the EPCO retained leases); (iv) gains and losses from asset sales and related transactions; and (v) general and administrative costs. Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses (net of the adjustments noted above) from segment revenues, with both segment totals before the elimination of intercompany transactions. In accordance with GAAP, intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, provision for income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before the allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interest. Recent Accounting Developments The following recent accounting developments will or may affect our future financial statements: § Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations; § Roadmap to Adoption of International Reporting Standards; and § Fair Value Measurements. For additional information regarding these recent accounting developments, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 120 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates, commodity prices and, to a limited extent, foreign exchange rates. In order to manage risks associated with certain anticipated transactions, we use derivative instruments. Derivatives are instruments whose fair value is determined by changes in a specified benchmark such as interest rates, commodity prices or currency values. Typical derivative instruments include futures, forward contracts, swaps, options and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. Interest Rate Derivative Instruments We utilize interest rate swaps, treasury locks and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain consolidated debt agreements. This strategy is a component in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings.

Commodity Derivative Instruments The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. We may use commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward agreements, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps, basis swaps and options contracts to mitigate such risks. Our predominant hedging strategies are: (i) hedging natural gas processing margins; (ii) hedging anticipated future contracted sales of NGLs, refined products and crude oil associated with volumes held in inventory and (iii) hedging the fair value of natural gas in inventory. The following information summarizes these hedging strategies: § The objective of our natural gas processing strategy is to hedge an amount of gross margin associated with our natural gas processing activities. We achieve this objective by using physical and financial instruments to lock in the purchase prices of natural gas consumed as PTR and the sales prices of the related NGL products. This program consists of (i) the forward sale of a portion of our expected equity NGL production at fixed prices through December 2011, which is achieved through the use of forward physical sales contracts and commodity derivative instruments and (ii) the purchase of commodity derivative instruments having a notional amount based on the volume of natural gas expected to be consumed as PTR in the production of such equity NGL production. At December 31, 2010, this program had hedged future estimated gross margins (before plant operating expenses) of $365.2 million on 11.4 MMBbls of forecasted NGL forward sales transactions and equivalent PTR volumes extending through December 2011. At January 31, 2011, this program had hedged future estimated gross margins (before plant operating expenses) of $377.0 million on 11.6 MMBbls of forecasted NGL forward sales transactions and equivalent PTR volumes extending through December 2011. § The objective of our NGL, refined products and crude oil sales hedging program is to hedge the margins of anticipated future sales of inventory by locking in sales prices through the use of forward physical sales contracts and commodity derivative instruments. § The objective of our natural gas inventory hedging program is to hedge the fair value of natural gas currently held in inventory by locking in the sales price of the inventory through the use of commodity derivative instruments. Certain basis swaps, basis spread options and other financial derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are used to manage market risks associated with anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas necessary to optimize our owned and contractually committed transportation and storage capacity. 122 Table of Contents There is some uncertainty involved in the timing of these transactions often due to the development of more favorable profit opportunities or when spreads are insufficient to cover variable costs thus reducing the likelihood that the transactions will occur as originally forecasted. As a result of this timing uncertainty, these derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting even though they are effective at managing the risk exposures of these assets. The earnings volatility caused by fluctuations in non-cash, mark-to-market earnings cannot be predicted and the impact to earnings could be material. The following table summarizes our commodity derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2010: Volume (1) Accounting Derivative Purpose Current Long-Term (2) Treatment Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Enterprise: Natural gas processing: Forecasted natural gas purchases for plant thermal reduction (“PTR”) (3) 35.8 Bcf n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs (4) 6.8 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Octane enhancement: Forecasted purchases of NGLs (4) n/a n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of octane enhancement products 2.8 MMBbls 0.2 MMBbls Cash flow hedge Natural gas marketing: Natural gas storage inventory management activities 13.4 Bcf n/a Fair value hedge NGL marketing: Forecasted purchases of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products 5.9 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products 6.9 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Refined products marketing: Forecasted purchases of refined products 2.6 MMBbls 0.1 MMBbls Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of refined products 3.7 MMBbls 0.2 MMBbls Cash flow hedge Crude oil marketing: Forecasted purchases of crude oil 1.4 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of crude oil 2.1 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Enterprise: Natural gas risk management activities (5,6) 474.3 Bcf 58.9 Bcf Mark-to-market Refined products risk management activities (6) 2.0 MMBbls n/a Mark-to-market Crude oil risk management activities (6) 0.1 MMBbls n/a Mark-to-market Duncan Energy Partners: Natural gas risk management activities (6) 2.8 Bcf n/a Mark-to-market (1) Volume for derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflects the total amount of volumes hedged whereas volume for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflects the absolute value of derivative notional volumes. (2) The maximum term for derivatives included in the long-term column is December 2013. (3) PTR represents the British thermal unit equivalent of the NGLs extracted from natural gas by a processing plant, and includes the natural gas used as plant fuel to extract those liquids, plant flare and other shortages. (4) Forecasted purchase volumes of NGLs under Octane enhancement and forecasted sales of NGL volumes under Natural gas processing exclude 1.7 MMBbls and 2.8 MMBbls, respectively, of additional hedges executed under contracts that have been designated as normal purchase/sales agreements. (5) Current and long-term volumes include approximately 162.5 Bcf and 6.9 Bcf, respectively, of physical derivative instruments that are predominantly priced at an index plus a premium or minus a discount related to location differences. (6) Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with transportation, processing and storage assets. We assess the risk of our commodity derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. The sensitivity analysis applied to these portfolios measures the potential income or loss (i.e., the change in fair value of the portfolio) based upon a hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying quoted 123 Table of Contents market prices of the commodity derivative instruments outstanding at the date indicated within the following tables. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our natural gas marketing portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2009 2010 2011 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Liability $ (1.5 ) $ (12.4 ) $ (13.3 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Liability (7.0 ) (21.5 ) (18.3 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 4.1 (3.3 ) (8.2 ) The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our NGL, refined products and petrochemical operations portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2009 2010 2011 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Liability $ (9.2 ) $ (40.3 ) $ (60.4 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Liability (43.2 ) (104.5 ) (121.4 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 24.8 24.0 0.6 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our crude oil marketing portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2009 2010 2011 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset $ 2.0 $ 1.8 $ 2.5 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 2.0 (0.3 ) 1.1 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 2.1 4.0 3.9 Foreign Currency Derivative Instruments Prior to January 1, 2011, we were exposed to a nominal amount of foreign currency exchange risk in connection with our NGL and natural gas marketing activities in Canada. In order to manage this risk, we entered into foreign exchange purchase contracts to lock in a currency exchange rate. At December 31, 2010, we had entered into offsetting foreign currency derivative instruments and our foreign currency portfolio had a zero notional amount of Canadian dollars. The fair market value of these derivative instruments was an asset of $0.2 million at December 31, 2010 and the total portfolio is accounted for using mark-to-market accounting. Product Purchase Commitments We have long and short-term purchase commitments for natural gas, NGLs, petrochemicals and other hydrocarbons with several suppliers. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. For additional information regarding these commitments, see “Other Items - Contractual Obligations” included under Item 7 of this annual report.",2023-12-30 21:17:28.811466

Overview of Business We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.” We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) related businesses of EPCO and are now a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemicals. Our midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the U.S., Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. Our assets include approximately 50,600 miles of onshore and offshore pipelines; 190 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemicals; and 14 Bcf of working natural gas storage capacity. Our midstream energy operations include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and import and export terminaling; crude oil and refined products transportation, storage, and terminaling; offshore production platforms; petrochemical transportation and services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems and in the Gulf of Mexico. We have six reportable business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services; (ii) Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services; (iii) Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services; (iv) Offshore Pipelines & Services; (v) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services; and (vi) Other Investments. We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. 74 Table of Contents Significant Recent Developments Development of Our ATEX Express Long-Haul Ethane Pipeline In January 2012, we announced the receipt of sufficient transportation commitments to support development of our 1,230-mile Appalachia to Texas pipeline (the “ATEX Express”) that will transport growing ethane production from the Marcellus and Utica Shale producing areas of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Demand for ethane feedstock over more expensive crude oil-based derivatives within the Gulf Coast petrochemical market has reached over 1 MMBPD and continues to increase given current pricing differentials. Several petrochemical companies have made announcements to modify, expand or build new facilities that would use ethane as a feedstock. As currently designed, the ATEX Express will have the capacity to transport up to 190 MBPD of ethane from the Appalachian production areas to our storage and distribution assets in southeast Texas. The project would utilize a combination of new and existing infrastructure. The northern portion of the ATEX Express involves construction of a pipeline that would originate in Pennsylvania and extend west, then southwest, to Indiana following existing pipeline corridors in order to minimize the footprint of the project. The southern portion of ATEX Express would utilize a significant portion of our existing Products Pipeline System, which would be reversed to accommodate southbound delivery of ethane to the U.S. Gulf Coast. At the southern terminus of the ATEX Express in Beaumont, we plan to construct a 55-mile pipeline to provide shippers with access to our NGL storage complex at Mont Belvieu, which would provide them with direct and indirect access to every ethylene plant in the U.S. We expect that the ATEX Express will begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2014. Plans to Construct a Crude Oil Pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico with Genesis In January 2012, we announced the execution of crude oil transportation agreements with a consortium of six Gulf of Mexico producers that will provide the necessary support for construction of a crude oil gathering pipeline serving the Lucius oil and gas field located in the southern Keathley Canyon area of the deepwater central Gulf of Mexico. The pipeline will be constructed and owned by Southeast Keathley Canyon Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (“SEKCO”), which is a 50/50 joint venture owned by us and Genesis Energy, L.P. (“Genesis”). We will serve as construction manager and operator of the new deepwater pipeline (the “SEKCO Oil Pipeline”). The 149-mile, 18-inch diameter SEKCO Oil Pipeline is being designed with a crude oil transportation capacity of 115 MBPD and would connect the third party owned Lucius-truss spar floating production platform to an existing junction platform at South Marsh Island 205 that is part of our Poseidon Oil Pipeline System. The Lucius production area is estimated to have more than 300 MMBbls of oil equivalent, with relatively shallow and highly productive reservoirs, primarily comprised of crude oil. The SEKCO Oil Pipeline is expected to begin service by mid-2014. Sale of 22.8 Million Common Units of Energy Transfer Equity In January 2012, we sold 22,762,636 common units of Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (“Energy Transfer Equity”) in a private transaction, which generated cash proceeds of approximately $825.1 million. Proceeds from this sale were used for general company purposes, including funding capital expenditures. Our Other Investments business segment consists of our investment in the common units of Energy Transfer Equity. As of the date of this report, we own approximately 6 million common units of Energy Transfer Equity, which represent less than 3% of its common units outstanding at February 15, 2012. Plans with Enbridge to Reverse the Seaway Pipeline In November 2011, ConocoPhillips agreed to sell its 50% partnership interest in Seaway Crude Pipeline Company (“Seaway”) to Enbridge Inc. (“Enbridge”). This transaction closed in December 2011. We own the remaining 50% partnership interest in Seaway, which owns the Seaway crude oil pipeline system (the “Seaway pipeline”), and operate the Seaway pipeline. Historically, the 546-mile Seaway pipeline transported imported crude oil from Freeport, Texas to the Cushing, Oklahoma hub. The increase in crude oil production from Canada’s tar 75 Table of Contents sands and U.S. fields like the Bakken in North Dakota and Niobrara in Kansas, Wyoming and Colorado, has led to an oversupply of oil at the Cushing hub. This oversupply at Cushing led to depressed prices for domestic crude oil production versus international and U.S. Gulf Coast benchmarks, which, in turn, created feedstock cost disadvantages for domestic refiners that rely primarily on imported crude oil. As a result of the change in ownership in Seaway, we and Enbridge Inc. agreed to reverse the direction of crude oil flows on the Seaway pipeline to enable it to transport oil from the oversupplied Cushing hub to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners. Pending regulatory approval, the Seaway pipeline could operate in reversed service with an initial capacity of 150 MBPD during the second quarter of 2012. Following pump station additions and other modifications, which are anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of 2013, we anticipate the capacity of the reversed Seaway pipeline will be up to 400 MBPD (assuming a mix of light and heavy grades of crude oil). We expect that this capacity will be fully contracted by shippers. In anticipation of additional shipper demand, we launched an open season in January 2012 to support a further expansion of the Seaway pipeline’s transportation capacity. The reversed Seaway pipeline will deliver crude oil from Cushing into the Houston, Texas market by utilizing affiliate and third party pipelines. Seaway plans to build a 45-mile pipeline that will link its pipeline to our Enterprise Crude Houston (“ECHO”) crude oil storage terminal, which is being constructed southeast of Houston. Completion of this pipeline segment is expected in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, Seaway plans to build an 85-mile pipeline from our ECHO facility to the Port Arthur/Beaumont, Texas refining center that would provide shippers access to the region’s heavy oil refining capabilities. Completion of this pipeline segment is expected in early 2014. Expansion of Our Natural Gas Pipeline and Processing Infrastructure in the Eagle Ford Shale In November 2011, we announced several new construction projects that would extend and expand our natural gas and NGL infrastructure in South Texas to accommodate expected production growth from the Eagle Ford Shale. As a result of additional demand from our Eagle Ford Shale producing customers, along with the execution of new gathering and processing agreements, we plan to expand natural gas processing capacity at our Yoakum facility (which is currently under construction) by an additional 300 MMcf/d. Once the expansion is completed, we expect our Yoakum facility will have total gas processing capacity of 900 MMcf/d. We also plan to increase the size of the NGL takeaway pipelines originating at the Yoakum plant to handle the expected increase in NGL production. We expect the Yoakum facility to commence operations in phases with the first 300 MMcf/d to be available by May 2012, the second 300 MMcf/d coming online in July 2012, and the third 300 MMcf/d to be available by February 2013. The new Yoakum plant will complement our seven existing natural gas processing plants in South Texas, which currently have the capacity to process approximately 1.5 Bcf/d. In addition to the Yoakum expansion, we are constructing 62 miles of natural gas pipeline loops and increasing compression to gather and transport an additional 300 MMcf/d of liquids-rich Eagle Ford Shale natural gas. These pipeline expansion projects are also expected to begin service in the first quarter of 2013. Start of Service on Our Acadian Haynesville Extension In November 2011, commercial operations on the Haynesville Extension of our Acadian Gas System commenced. As a result of completing the Haynesville Extension project, we have provided producers in Louisiana’s Haynesville and Bossier Shale plays with access to 1.8 Bcf/d of incremental natural gas takeaway capacity. As an extension of our Acadian Gas System, the Haynesville Extension offers producers access to more than 150 end-user customer service locations along the Mississippi River industrial corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, as well as the Henry Hub. The Haynesville Extension features interconnects with twelve interstate pipeline systems and is the only southerly option that avoids potential natural gas supply bottlenecks at the Perryville Hub and offers producers flow assurance and market choice to assist in maximizing the value of their natural gas. Sale of Our Mississippi Natural Gas Storage Facilities In October 2011, we announced the execution of definitive agreements to sell our ownership interests in Crystal Holding L.L.C. (“Crystal”) to Boardwalk HP Storage Company, LLC for $550 million in cash, before 76 Table of Contents working capital adjustments of $2.2 million. The transaction closed in December 2011 and we recorded a gain of $129.1 million on the sale. Crystal owns two underground salt dome natural gas storage facilities located near Petal and Hattiesburg, Mississippi having approximately 29 Bcf of total storage capacity and related pipelines. Proceeds from this sale were used for general company purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures. Crystal’s operations were a component of our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services business segment. We have determined that Crystal’s operations do not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. Following the sale, we continue to have significant commercial contracts and operational arrangements at the Petal and Hattiesburg facilities, which are adjacent to and currently share operating assets with our retained Petal, Mississippi NGL storage facility. Completion of the Duncan Merger In September 2011, the Duncan Merger Agreement was approved by the unitholders of Duncan Energy Partners and the merger of Duncan MergerCo and Duncan Energy Partners and related transactions were completed, with Duncan Energy Partners surviving such merger as our wholly owned subsidiary. Each issued and outstanding common unit of Duncan Energy Partners was cancelled and converted into the right to receive our limited partner common units based on an exchange ratio of 1.01 Enterprise common units for each Duncan Energy Partners common unit. We issued 24,277,310 of our common units (net of fractional common units cashed out) to the former public unitholders of Duncan Energy Partners as consideration in the Duncan Merger. We did not issue any common units as merger consideration to our subsidiaries that owned limited partner interests in Duncan Energy Partners. Development of the Texas Express Pipeline with Enbridge and Anadarko In September 2011, we, along with Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (“Enbridge”) and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (“Anadarko”), announced an agreement to design and construct a new NGL pipeline (the “Texas Express Pipeline”) that would originate in Skellytown, Texas and extend approximately 580 miles to NGL fractionation and storage facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas. NGL volumes from the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin and Mid-continent regions will be delivered to the Texas Express Pipeline through an interconnect with the Conway South segment of our Mid-America Pipeline System. The Texas Express Pipeline will help producers in West and Central Texas, the Rocky Mountains, Southern Oklahoma and the Mid-continent to maximize the value of their NGL production by providing additional takeaway capacity and enhanced access to the U.S. Gulf Coast NGL market. Initial transportation capacity on the Texas Express Pipeline is expected to be approximately 250 MBPD, which could be expanded to approximately 400 MBPD. The new pipeline will be constructed and owned by Texas Express Pipeline LLC, the membership interests of which are held by us (45% share), Enbridge (35% share) and Anadarko (20% share). We will serve as construction manager and operator of the Texas Express Pipeline. In addition, the joint venture plans to construct and own two new NGL gathering systems. The first NGL gathering system will connect the Texas Express Pipeline to natural gas processing plants in the Anadarko/Granite Wash production area located in the Texas Panhandle and Western Oklahoma. The second NGL gathering system will connect the new pipeline to Barnett Shale gas processing plants located in Central Texas. Enbridge will serve as construction manager and operator of these NGL gathering systems. Subject to regulatory approvals, the Texas Express Pipeline and related NGL gathering systems are expected to begin service in the second quarter of 2013. Plans to Build a Sixth NGL Fractionator at Our Mont Belvieu Complex In June 2011, we announced plans to construct a sixth NGL fractionator at our Mont Belvieu, Texas facility. The new fractionation facility will have a nameplate capacity of 75 MBPD and accommodate NGLs from the continued growth of liquids-rich natural gas production from the Eagle Ford Shale and other producing areas. We have started construction of the new fractionator, and we expect it to begin service in late 2012. In October 2011, commercial operations at our fifth NGL fractionator at Mont Belvieu commenced. This new fractionator increases the total nameplate NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu facility to 380 MBPD. When our sixth Mont Belvieu NGL fractionator is completed, we will have the capability to fractionate 77 Table of Contents more than 450 MBPD of NGLs at our Mont Belvieu complex and our system-wide net fractionation capacity will increase to approximately 770 MBPD. Expansion of Our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System In May 2011, we announced plans to build an 80-mile extension of our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System (the “Phase II project”), which would allow us to serve growing production areas in the southwestern portion of the Eagle Ford Shale supply basin. The Phase II project, which is being designed with a crude oil transportation capacity of 200 MBPD, will originate at Lyssy, Texas (at the terminus of our previously announced 140-mile Phase I segment) and extend to Gardendale, Texas, where a new central delivery point is planned for construction that will feature 0.5 MMBbls of crude oil storage. The system’s Phase I pipeline expansion project, which is expected to have a crude oil transportation capacity of 350 MBPD, originates at Sealy, Texas and extends to Lyssy, Texas. Phase I of the expansion project includes construction of 2.4 MMBbls of crude oil storage along the new pipeline, including 0.6 MMBbls at Lyssy, Texas, 0.2 MMBbls at Milton, Texas, 0.4 MMBbls at Marshall, Texas, and 1.2 MMBbls at Sealy, Texas. Phase I of the project is forecast to begin service by the second quarter of 2012, with Phase II set to commence operations in the first quarter of 2013. When completed, the approximately 220-miles of additional crude oil pipelines are expected to provide Eagle Ford Shale producers with access to the Texas Gulf Coast refining complex through our integrated midstream asset network, including our ECHO crude oil terminal which is under construction. The ECHO terminal will provide shippers with access to major refiners located in the Houston and Texas City, Texas refining hub representing more than 2 MMBPD of refining capacity. The ECHO terminal will also have connections to marine facilities which will provide connectivity to any refinery on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The ECHO facility is scheduled to begin service in mid-2012 and will initially have 0.8 MMBbls of crude oil storage capacity. In February 2012, we announced an expansion of our ECHO facility, which will provide capability to increase its crude oil storage capacity to approximately 6 MMBbls. Expansion of Our Propylene Fractionation Capacity at Mont Belvieu In May 2011, we announced plans to expand our Mont Belvieu polymer grade propylene (“PGP”) fractionation facility to accommodate increased PGP demand. When completed, the expansion project will increase our net capacity to produce PGP by more than 10% from 73 MBPD (approximately 4.9 billion pounds per year) to 80.5 MBPD (approximately 5.4 billion pounds per year). The expansion is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2013. To produce PGP, which is approximately 99.5% pure propylene, we fractionate refinery grade propylene (“RGP”), which is approximately 60% to 65% propylene, with the remainder being propane and butane. The demand for PGP primarily relates to the manufacture of polypropylene, which has a variety of end uses including packaging film, fiber for carpets and upholstery, and molded plastic parts for appliances, automotive, houseware and medical products. Since 2000, demand for PGP has increased by 20%; however, the supply of PGP produced as a co-product from the cracking of crude oil derivatives in the production of ethylene has declined approximately 40%. This decline is attributable to ethylene producers using more NGLs, such as ethane and propane, as feedstocks instead of more costly crude oil derivatives. We have an extensive integrated propylene infrastructure system that complements the expansion project. Through our Texas City RGP Gathering System, which connects to 13 refineries in the Houston, Texas area, as well as marine, rail and truck transportation capabilities at our Mont Belvieu complex, we can receive supplies of RGP from approximately 60 facilities across North America. On the delivery side, we connect to 17 consumers of PGP. We also have the only operating PGP export terminal in the U.S. located in Seabrook, Texas. This export facility enables us to provide PGP to growing international markets. Expansion of Our Houston Ship Channel Import/Export Terminal In March 2011, we announced an expansion of our primary Houston Ship Channel import/export terminal. This expansion project is expected to nearly double the terminal’s fully refrigerated export loading capacity for 78 Table of Contents propane and other NGLs to more than 10,000 barrels per hour, while enhancing the terminal’s ability to load multiple vessels simultaneously. We expect to complete this expansion project in the second half of 2012. Expansion of Our Mid-America Pipeline System in the Rocky Mountains In March 2011, we announced an expansion project involving the Rocky Mountain segment of our Mid-America Pipeline System. The 2,932-mile Rocky Mountain pipeline transports mixed NGLs from the Rocky Mountain Overthrust and San Juan Basin areas to our Hobbs NGL fractionation facility located in Gaines County, Texas. At the Hobbs facility, the Mid-America Pipeline System links to our Seminole Pipeline, which enables shippers access to the world’s largest NGL fractionation complex at Mont Belvieu, Texas, including facilities owned and operated by us. The Rocky Mountain pipeline expansion involves looping the existing system with approximately 218 miles of 16-inch diameter pipeline, as well as pump station modifications. This expansion project is expected to add 62.5 MBPD of transportation capacity to the Rocky Mountain pipeline’s existing capacity of approximately 275 MBPD (after taking into account shipper commitments announced in January 2012). The additional capacity is designed to handle growing natural gas and NGL production from major supply basins in Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico. Several new natural gas processing plants are being constructed in the Uinta, Piceance and Greater Green River basins that will fill the expansion, which is expected to begin service in the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, the Rocky Mountain expansion project complements our Texas Express Pipeline joint venture, and enhances the growth opportunities of our integrated processing, pipeline, storage, fractionation and distribution network. Incident at Our Mont Belvieu West Storage Facility In February 2011, we experienced an NGL release and fire at the West Storage location of our Mont Belvieu, Texas underground storage facility. West Storage consists of ten underground salt dome storage caverns with a storage capacity of approximately 15 MMBbls. Through the reconfiguration of product receipt and delivery capabilities and other measures, we readily returned our Mont Belvieu plants and related assets to close to the same capabilities as we had prior to the incident; however, our West Storage location and associated underground storage wells remain partially inoperative at this time. Remaining repairs to this location are underway and are expected to be completed in stages by mid-2012. We participate as a named insured in EPCO’s insurance program, which provides us with property damage, business interruption and other insurance coverage, the scope and amounts of which we believe are customary and prudent for the nature and extent of our operations. Our deductible for this incident was $5 million. We remain in negotiation with our insurance carriers regarding the overall claim, which is currently projected to be at least $150 million. As non-refundable insurance proceeds are received, we expect to record gains related to this incident. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding insurance matters. General Outlook for 2012 Commercial Outlook We provide midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemicals. Factors that can affect the demand for our products and services include global and U.S. economic conditions, the market price and demand for energy, the cost to develop natural gas and crude oil reserves in the U.S., and the cost and availability of capital to energy companies to invest in exploration and production activities. The global economic expansion that began in late 2009 continued in 2011, with all of the twenty largest developed economies (“G20”), except for Japan, reporting year-over-year growth in real gross domestic product (“GDP”) for 2011. This growth appears to be continuing in early 2012. The U.S. reported modest year-over-year real GDP growth of 1.7% for 2011 compared to 2010. By comparison, the U.S. reported year-over-year real GDP growth of 3.0% for 2010 compared to 2009. 79 Table of Contents Global demand for petroleum products continues to increase at a rate, similar to that of global economic growth, which continues to benefit from the rate of growth in developing economies. However, in the U.S. and other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) countries, demand for petroleum products has declined slightly responding to higher prices, increased regulation, and improved technology. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, consumption of natural gas increased 3.7% for the first eleven months of 2011 versus the same period in 2010 primarily due to power generation requirements. Conversely, U.S. demand for petroleum products used for transportation purposes (e.g., motor gasoline, distillate and jet fuel) for the first eleven months of 2011 decreased by 1.7% compared to the same period of 2010. As a result of increased global demand and geopolitical concerns, crude oil prices have continued to increase. The average prices of West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil for 2009, 2010 and 2011 were $61.88, $79.53 and $95.12 per barrel, respectively. Crude oil futures for calendar year 2012 as quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) are currently $106.83 per barrel. In contrast, natural gas prices decreased from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to increasing shale gas production in the U.S., which has led to excess domestic natural gas supplies. For example, Henry Hub natural gas prices for 2009, 2010 and 2011 averaged $3.99, $4.39 and $4.04 per MMBtu, respectively. Henry Hub natural gas futures for calendar year 2012 as quoted on the NYMEX are currently $2.97 per MMBtu. Notably, the substantial change in the price relationship between natural gas and crude oil that began in 2009 has continued into 2012. In 2009, natural gas was priced at 37% of crude oil on an energy equivalent basis compared to 31% in 2010 and 24% in 2011. Based on NYMEX futures for 2012, natural gas is currently priced at approximately 16% relative to the price of crude oil on an energy equivalent basis. As a result of the current relative prices of crude oil and NGLs compared to the price of natural gas, exploration and production companies are reallocating capital to increase drilling activities in shale and other non-conventional resource plays that produce crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas. Generally, producers are decreasing drilling activity in onshore areas that produce dry natural gas. This same trend is also occurring in the Gulf of Mexico, with producers investing capital to develop new sources of crude oil production rather than natural gas. Natural gas and NGLs have had a significant feedstock price advantage over more costly crude oil derivatives (such as naphtha) and this trend is expected to continue based on prices currently quoted on the futures markets. This trend is primarily due to the following factors: (i) a decline in global crude oil excess production capacity; (ii) more government-held acreage being off limits to non-sovereign energy companies; (iii) geopolitical risk; (iv) growing demand for crude oil by China, India and other developing economies; (v) the globalization of international natural gas markets with more foreign-based liquefied natural gas liquefaction facilities becoming operational; (vi) technological breakthroughs in connection with shale resource plays in the U.S. that have decreased finding and development costs for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil; and (vii) the general inability to export natural gas from the U.S. Domestic energy producers and petrochemical companies are strategically repositioning their companies accordingly. We believe this new trend in domestic energy production has led to a long-term structural change in feedstock selection by the domestic petrochemical industry, which is the largest consumer of NGLs. Lower feedstock costs have provided U.S. ethylene producers with a competitive global cost advantage, as ethylene crackers in Europe and Asia are mostly limited to using higher-priced naphtha feedstocks (which are priced more closely to crude oil). For 2009 through 2011, ethane and propane have been the most consistently profitable feedstocks in the production of ethylene, and are forecasted to remain so in 2012. The production cost advantage enjoyed by U.S. petrochemical companies has led them to maximize their consumption of NGLs in the production of ethylene. Since 2009, many of these companies have expanded their operations in the U.S. and are continuing to build flexibility into their existing operations in order to increase their consumption of NGLs (as economically warranted). Even non-U.S. based ethylene crackers have responded to the NGL feedstock cost advantage by importing propane, including propane produced in the U.S., to displace crude oil derivatives such as naphtha as feedstock. Per industry publications, domestic production of ethylene increased approximately 3.1% from 2010 to 2011. In 2011, the average ethane consumption of U.S. ethylene producers was approximately 934 MBPD, which represents an increase of 53 MBPD over 2010 levels, and we expect the trend to continue upward. According to 80 Table of Contents recent industry publications, ethane demand by the domestic ethylene industry approximated 1 million barrels per day in December 2011. We believe the U.S. ethylene industry could consume approximately 250 MBPD of incremental ethane feedstocks over the next three years through modifications, expansions and debottlenecks of existing facilities. In addition, petrochemical companies have announced plans to construct additional world-scale ethylene plants in the U.S. in the coming years. Strong end-user demand for NGLs and increases in liquids-rich natural gas production from developing shale plays such as the Eagle Ford, Uinta, Granite Wash, Marcellus and Utica Shales are expected to: (i) keep certain of our natural gas pipelines and processing plants and our NGL fractionators, pipelines, storage and export facilities operating at high utilization rates; (ii) provide attractive natural gas processing margins for our equity NGL production; and (iii) provide us with additional opportunities to invest capital to build new natural gas pipelines and processing facilities, NGL fractionation and pipeline facilities, and crude oil pipelines. Henry Hub natural gas prices have significantly declined from a peak of over $13.00 per MMBtu in mid-2008 to less than $2.68 per MMBtu in February 2012. This price decrease has generally resulted in energy companies reallocating and, in some cases, reducing their drilling capital expenditure budgets. Natural gas drilling rig counts generally respond to changes in price and have moved down from a peak of 1,606 gas-directed rigs in 2008 to 919 at year end 2010, 809 at year end 2011 and approximately 720 in February 2012. Even though the total natural gas rig count has dropped from peak levels, the substantial efficiencies of horizontal drilling in the non-conventional and shale resource basins have allowed producers to maintain overall natural gas deliverability. As a result, rig count is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the level of future natural gas production or reserves. Because of the market prices of crude oil and NGLs, drilling activity is especially robust in shale plays containing crude oil, condensate and liquids-rich natural gas production such as the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash, Bakken and Marcellus Shales. Drilling activity in shale plays with dry natural gas production, such as the Haynesville/Bossier and Fayetteville, is down from peak levels, but remains active as certain producers are drilling to hold recently executed leases or have entered into joint ventures whereby their new joint venture partners are providing the capital to fund the development of the area for a certain period of time and for a certain dollar amount. In areas with conventional natural gas reserves, where producers typically have higher finding costs and leases are usually already held by production, rig counts generally remain significantly below peak levels. Based on forecasted new drilling activity, the number of drilled wells waiting to be connected to our pipeline systems, and natural depletion of the associated resource basins, we believe the aggregate natural gas pipeline volumes transported on our Jonah Gathering System, Piceance Basin Gathering System and San Juan Gathering System for 2012 could range from an increase of 5% to a decrease of 5% compared to volumes transported in 2011. These areas have substantial, undeveloped non-conventional natural gas reserves (e.g., prospects to develop additional production horizons in these basins such as the Mancos and Niobrara Shales) with some of the lowest finding costs in the U.S. and are supported by existing pipeline infrastructure to transport the natural gas to market. We believe that as U.S. natural gas supply and demand becomes more balanced and natural gas prices become less volatile, these areas could experience an increase in drilling activity to support, and potentially increase, current production levels. In the Eagle Ford Shale, which runs parallel to the Texas Gulf Coast and adjacent to our Texas Intrastate System, we have completed several pipeline projects that enable us to gather, transport and process approximately 900 MMcf/d of new natural gas production from the area. Generally, energy companies are continuing to have success in the Eagle Ford Shale and have indicated plans to accelerate their associated drilling programs. Production from this region includes crude oil, condensate, liquids-rich natural gas and dry natural gas. In 2010, we announced expansions of our natural gas pipeline, storage and processing facilities; NGL pipeline and fractionation facilities; and crude oil pipeline and storage facilities to facilitate production growth from this region. These projects represent approximately $3.0 to $3.5 billion of capital expenditures in the aggregate from 2010 through 2013. Natural gas production from the Haynesville/Bossier Shale area of northern Louisiana has grown rapidly over the last three years and has the potential to grow even more over the next several years if natural gas prices show some recovery from their recent low levels. In November 2011, we completed construction and began commercial operations on our $1.5 billion Haynesville Extension of our Acadian Gas System. The Haynesville 81 Table of Contents Extension is a 270-mile, 42-inch/36-inch pipeline designed to transport up to 1.8 Bcf/d of natural gas and is backed by 10-year firm fixed fee commitments from producers. We estimate that natural gas and crude oil volumes handled by our offshore Gulf of Mexico assets will be slightly lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower exploration and production activities that began in the second half of 2010 caused by federal regulatory uncertainty in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. We believe crude oil volumes on our systems will increase from 2011 levels once drilling and development activities resume. Natural gas pipeline volumes may be slower to return to historical levels due to producers’ allocating their capital to develop crude oil plays rather than natural gas plays due to the relative prices of these commodities. We estimate average volumes on our largest offshore asset, the Independence Hub platform and Trail pipeline will range between 350 BBtus/d and 450 BBtus/d in 2012 compared to an average of 500 BBtus/d in 2011. For the first 60 months after the Independence Hub platform went into service in March 2007, the platform has been earning a monthly demand charge of $4.6 million. This 60-month period will expire in March 2012, and this monthly demand charge will terminate. Enterprise owns 80% of the Independence Hub platform. Our refined products pipeline systems generally serve Petroleum Administration for Defense District (“PADD”) 2 of the U.S. Refinery production in PADD 2 increased by 66 MBPD in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the profit margin advantage that refiners in PADD 2 had relative to refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast. This advantage resulted from PADD 2 refiners having the ability to utilize WTI-priced crude oil, which was priced at a substantial discount to crude oil used by refiners on the Gulf Coast (i.e., crude oil prices paid by Gulf Coast refiners are primarily based on international prices for crude oil). Demand for refined products in PADD 2 for 2011 was approximately 4.4 MMBbls/d, which was a decrease of 1.9% compared to 2010. Our Products Pipeline System and Centennial Pipeline transport refined products produced by refineries on the Gulf Coast to be consumed in the PADD 2 region. As a result of the increased refinery production in PADD 2, demand to transport refined products to PADD 2 on our pipelines decreased. Throughput volumes to PADD 2 in 2011 on our refined products pipelines decreased by 116 MBPD to 301 MBPD. We do not expect a significant increase in demand for our refined products transportation services from the Gulf Coast to PADD 2 in 2012. Price differentials between WTI and Brent crude oil were much wider than normal in 2011, as oil production from sources north of the Cushing hub in Oklahoma, including the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and the Canadian Oil Sands increased without adequate incremental pipeline capacity to transport them southward to markets along the Gulf Coast. These spreads reached as high as $27 per barrel in October 2011, but tightened after we and Enbridge announced their plans to reverse and expand the Seaway pipeline in November 2011 in order to move crude oil from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast. In addition to the planned Seaway pipeline reversal, a significant amount of rail capacity was added in 2011 in order to move crude southward from the producing areas and Cushing hub to refining centers. For additional information regarding the planned reversal of the Seaway pipeline, see “—Significant Recent Developments—Plans with Enbridge to Reverse the Seaway Pipeline” within this Item 7 discussion. Liquidity Outlook The corporate debt and equity capital markets were generally accessible in 2011. Sovereign credit markets, however, continue to be volatile due to large budget deficits being incurred by the United States, United Kingdom and many developed European countries. The cost of our term debt and equity capital generally declined and the availability of term debt and equity capital improved. Likewise, the general availability of credit commitments from most banks also improved from a year ago, except for certain investment banks and European banks, which are being impacted by their cost of capital and sovereign debt concerns. At December 31, 2011, we had $3.37 billion of consolidated liquidity, which is defined as unrestricted cash on hand plus borrowing capacity available under our $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In January 2012, we sold 22,762,636 common units of Energy Transfer Equity in a private transaction, which generated cash proceeds of approximately $825.1 million. In February 2012, we paid a quarterly cash distribution of $530.4 million to unitholders with respect to the fourth quarter of 2011. Also in February 2012, EPO issued $750.0 million in principal amount of 30-year unsecured Senior Notes EE. Net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes EE were 82 Table of Contents used to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility (which was used to repay at maturity its $490.5 million principal amount of Senior Notes S due February 2012 and $9.5 million principal amount of TEPPCO Senior Notes due February 2012 prior to the delivery of Senior Notes EE) and for general company purposes. We currently estimate that our capital expenditures for 2011 will approximate $3.8 billion, which includes approximately $3.5 billion for growth capital projects and $315 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Based on current market conditions, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs. In January 2012, Standard & Poor’s upgraded its corporate credit rating of EPO from BBB- to BBB, while maintaining its outlook for EPO’s business as “positive.” Moody’s Investor Services (“Moody’s”) did likewise, upgrading its credit rating of EPO from Baa3 to Baa2 and reaffirming that its outlook for EPO’s business remained “positive.” In February 2012, Fitch Ratings upgraded its corporate credit rating of EPO to BBB while maintaining its outlook for EPO’s business as “stable.” Based on information currently available to us, we believe we will maintain the aforementioned credit ratings and meet our loan covenant obligations in 2012. As of the date of this report, we have approximately $2.85 billion of senior notes maturing in the period beginning 2012 through the end of 2014. The U.S. government is expected to run substantial annual budget deficits (exceeding a trillion dollars each year) that will require a corresponding issuance of debt by the U.S. Treasury from 2012 through 2014. The interest rate on U.S. Treasury debt has a direct impact on the cost of our debt. At this time, we are uncertain what the impact of the expected large issuances of U.S. Treasury debt and the prevailing economic and capital market conditions during these future periods will have on the cost and availability of capital. We have executed approximately $1.35 billion of interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our expected future debt issuances in connection with the refinancing of our debt that matures during the 2012 through 2013 time period. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the condition of the capital markets and interest rate risk with respect to refinancing these maturities and funding our capital expenditures.

Our largest non-affiliated customer for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was Shell Oil Company and its affiliates, which accounted for 10.6%, 9.4% and 9.8% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. Basis of Financial Statement Presentation In accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and various other accounting standard-setting organizations, our general purpose financial statements reflect the consolidation of financial information of businesses that we control. Our general purpose Consolidated Financial Statements present those investments over which we do not have control as unconsolidated affiliates (e.g., our equity method 84 Table of Contents investment in Energy Transfer Equity). Noncontrolling interest reflects third party and related party ownership of our consolidated subsidiaries. Prior to the Holdings Merger, Enterprise was a consolidated subsidiary of Holdings, which was Enterprise’s parent. Upon completion of the Holdings Merger, Holdings merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Enterprise. The Holdings Merger resulted in Holdings being considered the surviving consolidated entity for accounting purposes, while Enterprise Products Partners L.P. is the surviving consolidated entity for legal and reporting purposes. For accounting purposes, Holdings is deemed the acquirer of the noncontrolling interests in Enterprise that were previously recognized in Holdings’ consolidated financial statements (i.e., the acquisition of Enterprise’s limited partner interests that were owned by parties other than Holdings). As a result of the Holdings Merger, Enterprise’s consolidated financial and operating results prior to November 22, 2010 have been presented as if Enterprise were Holdings from an accounting perspective (i.e., the financial statements of Holdings became the historical financial statements of Enterprise). While it was a publicly traded partnership, Holdings (NYSE, ticker symbol “EPE”) electronically filed its annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements with the SEC. You can access this information at www.sec.gov. The primary differences between Holdings’ and Enterprise’s consolidated results of operations were (i) general and administrative costs incurred by Holdings and EPGP (our former general partner); (ii) equity in income of Holdings’ noncontrolling ownership interests in Energy Transfer Equity; and (iii) interest expense associated with Holdings’ debt. In addition, for periods prior to November 22, 2010, the net assets, income, cash distributions and contributions and other amounts attributable to Enterprise’s limited partner interests that were owned by third parties and related parties other than Holdings are presented as a component of noncontrolling interests. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our noncontrolling interests. Historical limited partner units outstanding and earnings per unit amounts presented in our financial statements have been retroactively presented in connection with the 1.5 to one unit-for-unit exchange that occurred under the Holdings Merger. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding earnings per unit. Since we historically consolidated Duncan Energy Partners for financial reporting purposes, the Duncan Merger did not change the basis of presentation of our historical financial statements. 85 Table of Contents Selected Price and Volumetric Data The following table presents selected annual and quarterly industry index prices for natural gas, crude oil and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods presented: Polymer Refinery Natural Normal Natural Grade Grade Gas, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Gasoline, Propylene, Propylene, Crude Oil, $/MMBtu $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/pound $/pound $/barrel (1) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (3) (3) (4) 2009 Averages $ 3.99 $ 0.48 $ 0.84 $ 1.08 $ 1.19 $ 1.31 $ 0.39 $ 0.34 $ 61.88 2010 1st Quarter $ 5.30 $ 0.73 $ 1.24 $ 1.52 $ 1.64 $ 1.82 $ 0.63 $ 0.54 $ 78.72 2nd Quarter $ 4.09 $ 0.55 $ 1.08 $ 1.47 $ 1.58 $ 1.81 $ 0.65 $ 0.44 $ 78.03 3rd Quarter $ 4.38 $ 0.48 $ 1.07 $ 1.38 $ 1.43 $ 1.71 $ 0.58 $ 0.44 $ 76.20 4th Quarter $ 3.80 $ 0.64 $ 1.26 $ 1.62 $ 1.68 $ 2.00 $ 0.59 $ 0.49 $ 85.17 2010 Averages $ 4.39 $ 0.60 $ 1.16 $ 1.50 $ 1.58 $ 1.84 $ 0.61 $ 0.48 $ 79.53 2011 1st Quarter $ 4.11 $ 0.66 $ 1.37 $ 1.75 $ 1.85 $ 2.27 $ 0.76 $ 0.68 $ 94.10 2nd Quarter $ 4.32 $ 0.78 $ 1.49 $ 1.87 $ 2.02 $ 2.48 $ 0.89 $ 0.79 $ 102.56 3rd Quarter $ 4.20 $ 0.78 $ 1.54 $ 1.88 $ 2.09 $ 2.37 $ 0.78 $ 0.67 $ 89.76 4th Quarter $ 3.54 $ 0.86 $ 1.44 $ 1.89 $ 2.26 $ 2.24 $ 0.59 $ 0.44 $ 94.06 2011 Averages $ 4.04 $ 0.77 $ 1.46 $ 1.85 $ 2.06 $ 2.34 $ 0.76 $ 0.64 $ 95.12 (1) Natural gas prices are based on Henry-Hub I-FERC commercial index prices.

For Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 NGL Pipelines & Services, net: NGL transportation volumes (MBPD) 2,284 2,322 2,196 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 575 485 461 Equity NGL production (MBPD) 116 121 117 Fee-based natural gas processing (MMcf/d) 3,820 2,932 2,650 Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, net: Natural gas transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 13,231 11,482 10,435 Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, net: Crude oil transportation volumes (MBPD) 678 670 680 Offshore Pipelines & Services, net: Natural gas transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 1,065 1,242 1,420 Crude oil transportation volumes (MBPD) 279 320 308 Platform natural gas processing (MMcf/d) 405 513 700 Platform crude oil processing (MBPD) 17 17 12 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services, net: Butane isomerization volumes (MBPD) 101 89 97 Propylene fractionation volumes (MBPD) 73 77 68 Octane additive and associated plant production volumes (MBPD) 17 16 10 Transportation volumes, primarily refined products and petrochemicals (MBPD) 759 869 806 Total, net: NGL, crude oil, refined products and petrochemical transportation volumes (MBPD) 4,000 4,181 3,990 Natural gas transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 14,296 12,724 11,855 Equivalent transportation volumes (MBPD) (1) 7,762 7,529 7,110 (1) Reflects equivalent energy volumes where 3.8 MMBtus of natural gas are equivalent to one barrel of NGLs. Comparison of 2011 with 2010 Revenues for 2011 were $44.31 billion compared to $33.74 billion for 2010, a $10.57 billion year-to-year increase. Consolidated revenues from sales of NGLs and related products increased $3.28 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices in 2011 compared to 2010. Revenues from sales of natural gas decreased $62.4 million year-to-year due to lower sales prices. Crude oil sales revenues increased $5.25 billion year-to-year due to higher sales prices and volumes. Consolidated revenues from sales of petrochemicals and refined products increased $1.99 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher propylene and refined products sales prices in 2011 compared to 2010. Consolidated revenues from other midstream services increased $117.3 million year-to-year primarily due to positive variances of $171.2 million related to the timing of the State Line and Fairplay acquisitions in May 2010 and our acquisition of a trucking business from EPCO in September 2010 (i.e., 2010 includes only a partial year of revenues from these acquired businesses) and $64.9 million related to the start of commercial operations on newly constructed assets such as the Haynesville Extension of our Acadian Gas System in November 2011. Collectively, the remainder of our consolidated revenues from other midstream services decreased $118.8 million year-to-year largely due to a decrease in throughput volumes on our Products Pipeline System and pipeline and platform assets offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Operating costs and expenses were $41.32 billion for 2011 compared to $31.45 billion for 2010, a $9.87 billion year-to-year increase. Cost of sales related to our marketing activities increased $8.20 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher crude oil sales volumes and, with the exception of natural gas, higher energy commodity prices. The operating costs and expenses of our natural gas processing plants increased $1.38 billion year-to-year primarily due to (i) an increase in plant thermal reduction (“PTR”) costs attributable to higher natural gas processing volumes and (ii) higher NGL prices during 2011 relative to 2010. In general, higher NGL prices result in increased operating costs associated with percent-of-proceeds and margin band types of natural gas processing contracts. 87 Table of Contents Consolidated operating costs and expenses also increased $160.6 million year-to-year due to the timing of the State Line and Fairplay acquisitions in May 2010 and our acquisition of a trucking business from EPCO in September 2010 (i.e., 2010 includes only a partial year of operating costs from these acquired businesses). Operating costs and expenses for the remainder of our midstream services increased $195.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher maintenance and pipeline integrity expenses we incurred in 2011 compared to 2010 and operating costs associated with assets we constructed and placed into service in 2011, including our Haynesville Extension and new Mont Belvieu NGL fractionator. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses included in operating costs and expenses increased $22.4 million year-to-year primarily due to depreciation expense recorded in connection with newly constructed assets being placed into service in mid-year 2010 and in 2011 and depreciation and amortization expense recorded in connection with assets acquired as a result of business combinations in mid-2010. We recorded $27.8 million of non-cash asset impairment charges in 2011 compared to $8.4 million of such charges during 2010. The $19.4 million increase in impairment charges primarily relates to write-downs of spare parts inventory and certain storage cavern assets. Gains from asset sales and related transactions included in operating costs and expenses increased $111.6 million year-to-year primarily due to a $129.1 million gain we recorded as a result of the sale of Crystal to Boardwalk that closed in December 2011. Changes in our revenues and operating costs and expenses year-to-year are explained in part by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $1.46 per gallon during 2011 versus $1.16 per gallon during 2010 – a 26% year-to-year increase. Our determination of the weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs is based on U.S. Gulf Coast prices for such products at Mont Belvieu, Texas, which is the primary industry hub for domestic NGL production. The market price of natural gas (as measured at Henry Hub in Louisiana) averaged $4.04 per MMBtu during 2011 versus $4.39 per MMBtu during 2010. The market price of crude oil (as measured on the NYMEX) averaged $95.12 per barrel during 2011 compared to $79.53 per barrel during 2010 – a 20% year-to-year increase. See “Selected Price and Volumetric Data” included within this Item 7 for additional historical energy commodity pricing information. General and administrative costs were $181.8 million for 2011 compared to $204.8 million for 2010, a $23.0 million year-to-year decrease. General and administrative costs for 2011 include transaction expenses of $12.0 million related to the Duncan Merger and $2.9 million related to the sale of Crystal. General and administrative costs for 2010 include $20.2 million of expenses related to the Employee Partnership liquidations and $24.5 million of transaction expenses related to the Holdings Merger. Collectively, the remainder of our general and administrative costs increased $6.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher employee compensation, office rent and depreciation expenses in 2011 compared to 2010. Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates was $46.4 million for 2011 compared to $62.0 million for 2010, a $15.6 million year-to-year decrease. Collectively, equity earnings from Seaway, Centennial Pipeline LLC (“Centennial”) and our investees operating in the Gulf of Mexico decreased $38.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower pipeline throughput volumes in 2011 compared to 2010. Equity earnings from Energy Transfer Equity increased $17.6 million year-to-year. Equity earnings from our investment in Venice Energy Service Company, L.L.C. (“VESCO”) increased $6.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher natural gas processing volumes and margins in 2011 compared to 2010. Collectively, equity earnings from our other equity method investees decreased $1.8 million year-to-year. Operating income for 2011 was $2.86 billion compared to $2.15 billion for 2010. Collectively, the changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity income described above resulted in the $711.9 million year-to-year increase in operating income. Consolidated interest expense increased $2.2 million year-to-year to $744.1 million in 2011 compared to $741.9 million in 2010. In general, interest expense represents that portion of borrowing costs (e.g., interest payments) that are not capitalized in connection with the funding of capital expenditures. Borrowing costs attributable to the funding of construction projects are capitalized until the related asset is placed in service, at which time the associated interest costs are then reflected as interest expense. Any borrowing costs that had been capitalized are expensed as a component of depreciation when the related fixed asset is placed into service. Interest expense also includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and the effects of interest rate hedging activities. 88 Table of Contents Although our average debt principal balances increased from $13.23 billion in 2010 to $14.59 billion in 2011, a substantial portion of the costs associated with the new borrowings were capitalized in connection with our capital spending program. Capitalized interest increased $59.5 million year-to-year to $106.7 million for 2011 from $47.2 million for 2010. Our consolidated interest expense amounts are directly impacted by changes in the weighted-average fixed and variable interest rates charged under our debt agreements. On average, interest rates continued to decrease over the last year. For example, as we refinanced the maturities of our fixed rate senior notes, the rates we obtained on the new debt issuances were lower than those associated with the debt being refinanced. However, as interest rates declined certain of our interest rate hedges partially mitigated the benefit of lower rates on the higher debt balances. Consolidated net income increased $704.6 million year-to-year to $2.09 billion for 2011 from $1.38 billion for 2010. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $41.4 million for 2011 compared to $1.06 billion for 2010, which included $1.0 billion attributable to the limited partners of Enterprise other than Holdings. For periods prior to the Holdings Merger, that portion of Enterprise’s net income attributable to its limited partner interests owned by third parties and related parties other than Holdings is presented as a component of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to partners increased $1.73 billion year-to-year to $2.05 billion for 2011 from $320.8 million for 2010. The following information highlights significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $2.18 billion for 2011 compared to $1.73 billion for 2010, a $451.6 million year-to-year increase. Gross operating margin for 2011 includes $4.3 million of gains related to cash proceeds from business interruption insurance claims. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding gains from business interruption insurance claims. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business was $1.32 billion for 2011 compared to $989.9 million for 2010, a $331.6 million year-to-year increase. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased $210.6 million year-to-year due to higher sales margins. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants located in the Rocky Mountains increased $71.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher natural gas processing margins and higher equity NGL production and fee-based processing volumes during 2011 compared to 2010. Collectively, gross operating margin from our natural gas processing facilities in southern Louisiana and the San Juan and Permian Basins increased $42.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher natural gas processing margins during 2011 compared to 2010. Results from our facilities in southern Louisiana include a $6.7 million year-to-year increase in equity earnings from our investment in VESCO. Natural gas processing activities on the Fairplay gathering system, which we acquired in May 2010, contributed $8.9 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin. Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage business was $638.4 million for 2011 compared to $604.8 million for 2010, a $33.6 million year-to-year increase. Total NGL transportation volumes decreased to 2,284 MBPD during 2011 from 2,322 MBPD during 2010. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related NGL terminals increased $53.0 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in revenues attributable to changes in the mix of transportation services provided to customers (e.g., increased long-haul delivery volumes and changes in delivery destinations) during 2011 compared to 2010 and an increase in system-wide tariffs in July 2011. Gross operating margin from our NGL storage activities increased $14.9 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in storage and terminaling fees charged at our NGL terminals in the northeastern U.S. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL System increased $5.0 million year-to-year primarily due to a $6.8 million charge we recorded during 2010 related to a dispute involving a pipeline segment on this system. Collectively, gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines in southern Louisiana decreased $18.5 million year-to-year primarily due to a 25 MBPD decrease in transportation volumes. The year-to-year decrease in NGL transportation volumes on our pipelines in southern Louisiana is primarily due to reduced supplies of NGLs during 2011 compared to 2010 from offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico and reduced volumes of mixed 89 Table of Contents NGLs transported from our facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas to NGL fractionators in southern Louisiana. Gross operating margin from our Dixie Pipeline and related NGL terminals decreased $13.7 million year-to-year primarily due to a 20 MBPD decrease in transportation volumes and higher pipeline integrity expenses during 2011. Downtime in connection with pipeline integrity projects we completed on the Dixie Pipeline during 2011 and warmer weather during the winter months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 both contributed to the year-to-year decrease in transportation volumes. Gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel import/export terminal and a related pipeline decreased $9.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating expenses during 2011 compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from our NGL fractionation business was $220.0 million for 2011 compared to $137.9 million for 2010, an $82.1 million year-to-year increase. Our NGL fractionation volumes were 575 MBPD during 2011 compared to 485 MBPD during 2010. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators increased $62.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher NGL fractionation volumes and fees. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we placed into service a fourth NGL fractionator at our complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas. We completed a fifth NGL fractionator at our Mont Belvieu complex and placed it into service during the fourth quarter of 2011. Collectively, our new NGL fractionators in Mont Belvieu added more than 150 MBPD of NGL fractionation capacity at this key industry hub. Gross operating margin from our Norco NGL fractionator increased $17.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher NGL prices, which resulted in higher revenues associated with percent-of-liquids contracts and product blending activities during 2011 compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from our Hobbs NGL fractionator increased $8.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher NGL fractionation volumes and fees. Gross operating margin from our Colorado NGL fractionators, which we sold during March 2011, decreased $4.9 million year-to-year. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $675.3 million for 2011 compared to $527.2 million for 2010, a $148.1 million year-to-year increase. Onshore natural gas transportation volumes were 13.23 TBtus/d during 2011 compared to 11.48 TBtus/d during 2010. Gross operating margin from our onshore natural gas pipelines and related marketing business was $633.1 million for 2011 compared to $471.7 million for 2010, a $161.4 million year-to-year increase. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities increased $50.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes and margins. Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System increased $62.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher firm capacity reservation revenues and a 280 BBtus/d year-to-year increase in natural gas throughput volumes. Increased natural gas production volumes from the Eagle Ford Shale supply basin resulted in stronger demand for our natural gas transportation services during 2011 compared to 2010. The year-to-year increase in transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System was also due to greater demand from gas-fired electric generation utilities as a result of record heat in Texas during the summer months of 2011. Gross operating margin from our Acadian Gas System increased $29.3 million year-to-year primarily due to revenues earned by our Haynesville Extension pipeline. The Haynesville Extension of our Acadian Gas System commenced operations in November 2011 and transported 1.22 TBtus/d of natural gas during the fourth quarter of 2011. Our State Line and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems, which we acquired in May 2010, contributed $26.5 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin. Gross operating margin from our Piceance Basin Gathering System increased $6.7 million year-to-year primarily due to a 195 BBtu/d increase in transportation volumes. Gross operating margin from our Jonah Gathering System decreased $14.4 million year-to-year on a 137 BBtu/d decrease in transportation volumes. Gross operating margin from our natural gas storage business was $42.2 million for 2011 compared to $55.5 million for 2010, a $13.3 million year-to-year decrease. In December 2011, we sold our natural gas storage facilities located near Petal and Hattiesburg, Mississippi. For additional information regarding the sale of these facilities, see “Significant Recent Developments—Sale of Our Mississippi Natural Gas Storage Facilities” within this Item 7. Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $234.0 million for 2011 compared to $113.7 million for 2010, a $120.3 million year-to-year increase. Our onshore crude oil transportation volumes increased to 678 MBPD during 2011 from 670 MBPD during 2010. Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related activities increased $96.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes and margins. Our crude oil marketing activities benefited from increased crude oil production 90 Table of Contents volumes from supply basins in the Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale, West Texas and Rocky Mountains. Collectively, gross operating margin from our South Texas System, West Texas System, Red River System and Basin Pipeline System increased $34.1 million year-to-year primarily due to a 46 MBPD increase in throughput volumes and higher average fees during 2011. Equity earnings from our investment in Seaway decreased $10.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower volumes delivered to the Cushing hub from the Texas Gulf Coast during 2011 compared to 2010. Net to our interest, throughput volumes on the Seaway pipeline system decreased 37 MBPD year-to-year. As a result of an oversupply of crude oil at the Cushing hub, crude oil in Cushing, Oklahoma is priced at a substantial discount to oil markets on the Gulf Coast. This has led refiners in the Midwest to source a significant amount of their crude oil feedstocks from the Cushing hub rather than shipping such volumes northward from the Gulf Coast (e.g., by using the Seaway pipeline). See “Significant Recent Developments—Plans with Enbridge to Reverse the Seaway Pipeline” within this Item 7, for information regarding a project to reverse the direction of crude oil flows on the Seaway pipeline to enable it to transport oil from the oversupplied Cushing hub to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $228.2 million for 2011 compared to $297.8 million for 2010, a $69.6 million year-to-year decrease. Results for 2010 include $27.5 million of gains related to insurance proceeds. Excluding gains from insurance proceeds, gross operating margin from this business segment decreased $42.1 million year-to-year primarily due to the effects of last year’s federal offshore drilling moratorium and the ongoing deliberations of federal authorities to approve drilling and well workover permits. Although crude oil and natural gas drilling activity has resumed on a limited basis since last year’s drilling moratorium (which was in effect from May 2010 to October 2010), certain of our offshore pipeline and platform assets continue to experience reduced throughput volumes as existing wells experience natural production declines. We expect that drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico will increase in the future as federal agencies allow exploration and production companies to proceed with the drilling of new wells. For additional information regarding the federal offshore drilling moratorium, see “—Additional regulations that cause delays or deter new offshore oil and gas drilling could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows” on page 55 under Item 1A of this annual report. Gross operating margin from our offshore crude oil pipeline business was $77.4 million for 2011 compared to $97.9 million for 2010, a $20.5 million year-to-year decrease. Our offshore crude oil transportation volumes averaged 279 MBPD during 2011 compared to 320 MBPD during 2010. Collectively, equity earnings from our investments in Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (“Poseidon”) and Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (“Cameron Highway”) decreased $16.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower throughput volumes. Net to our interest, crude oil throughput volumes on the Poseidon and Cameron Highway pipelines decreased 39 MBPD year-to-year. Collectively, gross operating margin from our Shenzi and Constitution Oil Pipelines decreased $4.9 million year-to-year on a 13 MBPD decrease in throughput volumes. Gross operating margin from our offshore natural gas pipeline business was $40.8 million for 2011 compared to $45.5 million for 2010, a $4.7 million year-to-year decrease. Our offshore natural gas transportation volumes were 1,065 BBtus/d during 2011 versus 1,242 BBtus/d during 2010. Gross operating margin from our Independence Trail pipeline decreased $12.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower transportation volumes. Natural gas transportation volumes on our Independence Trail pipeline decreased to 461 BBtus/d during 2011 from 576 BBtus/d during 2010 as a result of lower volumes from the Independence Hub platform (see below). Gross operating margin from our High Island Offshore System decreased $4.8 million year-to-year primarily due to a decrease in volumes and 2010 included $4.2 million of revenues attributable to a rate case settlement. Gross operating margin from our Anaconda system increased $6.8 million year-to-year primarily due to a system extension we completed and placed into service during the third quarter of 2011. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our offshore natural gas pipeline business increased $5.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower operating expenses on our Viosca Knoll Gathering System during 2011 compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from our offshore platform services business was $110.0 million for 2011 compared to $126.9 million for 2010, a $16.9 million year-to-year decrease. On a net basis to our interest, platform natural gas processing volumes were 405 MMcf/d during 2011 compared to 513 MMcf/d during 2010. Gross operating margin from our Independence Hub platform decreased $10.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower natural gas processing volumes as a result of depletion at existing production wells, the watering-out of certain wells 91 Table of Contents and the lingering impact of the federal offshore drilling moratorium which has slowed the drilling of new wells. Gross operating margin from the remainder of our offshore platforms decreased $6.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower natural gas processing volumes and higher maintenance expenses at our offshore platforms in the Garden Banks area of the Gulf of Mexico. Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $535.2 million for 2011 compared to $584.5 million for 2010, a $49.3 million year-to-year decrease. Gross operating margin from propylene fractionation and related activities was $161.2 million for 2011 compared to $212.4 million for 2010, a $51.2 million year-to-year decrease. Propylene fractionation volumes were 73 MBPD during 2011 compared to 77 MBPD during 2010. The year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is primarily due to lower propylene fractionation volumes and sales margins during 2011 compared to 2010. Results for 2010 benefited from the combined effects of high demand for propylene and reduced propylene production from third party petrochemical facilities. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization was $124.9 million for 2011 compared to $84.9 million for 2010, a $40.0 million year-to-year increase. Butane isomerization volumes increased to 101 MBPD during 2011 from 89 MBPD during 2010. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher isomerization volumes and increased by-product production and associated sales margins. Gross operating margin from octane enhancement and HPIB production was $109.1 million for 2011 compared to $47.0 million for 2010, a $62.1 million year-to-year increase. Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas increased $54.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher motor gasoline additive sales volumes and margins during 2011 compared to 2010. The remainder of the year-to-year increase is attributable to the addition of gross operating margin from recently acquired assets. Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related activities was $79.6 million for 2011 compared to $170.8 million for 2010, a $91.2 million year-to-year decrease. Pipeline transportation volumes for the refined products business decreased to 642 MBPD during 2011 from 734 MBPD during 2010. Gross operating margin from our Products Pipeline System decreased $69.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower throughput volumes and higher operating expenses during 2011 compared to 2010. Equity earnings from our investment in Centennial decreased $9.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower transportation volumes. Net to our interest, transportation volumes on the Centennial pipeline decreased 22 MBPD year-to-year. Structural shifts in population, reduced demand and increased refinery production in the Midwest have contributed to a decline in demand for the transportation of refined products from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest. Gross operating margin from the marketing of refined products decreased $12.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins associated with forward sales contracts. Of the total year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin from the Products Pipeline System, we estimate that $13.7 million is due to higher operating expenses attributable to the impact of a pipeline leak that occurred in New York State in the third quarter of 2010. Following our repair of the leak, the affected segment of pipe was tested and returned to service in February 2011. In addition, results from our Products Pipeline System for 2011 include $9.1 million of operating expenses related to environmental remediation efforts and pipeline repairs following pipeline leaks that occurred in Texas and Louisiana. The remaining $47.0 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin from our Products Pipeline System is primarily due to lower volumes delivered to Northeast U.S. markets and higher operating costs such as expenses for maintenance and pipeline integrity projects. Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other segment services was $60.4 million for 2011 compared to $69.4 million for 2010, a $9.0 million year-to-year decrease. Gross operating margin from marine transportation decreased $14.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower revenues resulting from our sale of marine transportation vessels in February 2011 that comprised our former bunker fuel transportation fleet. Gross operating margin from other services increased $5.4 million year-to-year primarily due to our acquisition of truck transport operations from EPCO in September 2010. Other Investments. Our equity earnings from Energy Transfer Equity were $14.8 million for 2011 compared to a loss of $2.8 million for 2010, a $17.6 million year-to-year increase. Our equity income from this 92 Table of Contents investment was reduced by $31.5 million and $36.3 million of excess cost amortization during 2011 and 2010, respectively. The equity income we recorded from this investment for 2011 is based on our estimate of Energy Transfer Equity’s net income attributable to partners. According to financial statements filed with the SEC, Energy Transfer Equity’s net income attributable to partners for 2010 was $192.8 million, which included $66.4 million of charges in connection with the termination of interest rate swaps and a $52.6 million non-cash impairment charge to write-down the carrying value of its investment in Midcontinent Express Pipeline, LLC. Comparison of 2010 with 2009 Revenues for 2010 were $33.74 billion compared to $25.51 billion for 2009, an $8.23 billion year-to-year increase. Higher energy commodity sales prices and volumes during 2010 compared to 2009 resulted in a $7.99 billion year-to-year increase in consolidated revenues from the sale of NGLs, natural gas, crude oil and petrochemical and refined products. Consolidated revenues from sales of NGLs and related products increased $1.85 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices in 2010 compared to 2009. Revenues from sales of natural gas increased $518.3 million year-to-year due to higher sales prices and volumes. Crude oil sales revenues increased $3.6 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices. Consolidated revenues from sales of other petrochemical and refined products increased $2.02 billion year-to-year primarily due to (i) higher petrochemical and refined products sales volumes and (ii) higher propylene sales prices during 2010 compared to 2009. Collectively, the remainder of our consolidated revenues increased $240.1 million year-to-year primarily due to revenues generated from businesses we acquired or assets we constructed, principally the State Line and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems we acquired in May 2010 and a trucking business we acquired from EPCO in September 2010. Operating costs and expenses were $31.45 billion for 2010 compared to $23.57 billion for 2009, a $7.88 billion year-to-year increase. The cost of sales related to our marketing activities increased $7.23 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher energy commodity prices and sales volumes. The operating costs and expenses of our natural gas processing plants increased $493.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher PTR costs attributable to an increase in natural gas prices and processing volumes. Operating costs and expenses for 2010 include approximately $174.3 million attributable to business acquisitions and the placing in service of newly constructed assets during the year. Operating costs and expenses for 2009 include aggregate charges of $135.3 million related to our dissociation from the Texas Offshore Port System partnership (“TOPS”) and $28.7 million of expenses incurred by TEPPCO in connection with its river terminal business. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses included in operating costs and expenses increased $127.0 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense attributable to assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions in 2010 and the placing in service of newly constructed assets during 2010. We recorded $8.4 million of non-cash asset impairment charges during 2010 compared to $33.5 million of charges during 2009, a $25.1 million year-to-year decrease. Non-cash impairment charges recorded in 2009 include $22.8 million of expense incurred by TEPPCO related to its refined products terminals. Gains from asset sales and related transactions included in operating costs and expenses increased $44.4 million year-to-year primarily due to $56.6 million gains recorded in connection with our disposition of certain offshore assets in 2010. Changes in our revenues and operating costs and expenses year-to-year are explained in part by changes in energy commodity prices. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $1.16 per gallon during 2010 versus $0.85 per gallon during 2009 – a 36% year-to-year increase. The Henry Hub market price of natural gas averaged $4.39 per MMBtu during 2010 versus $3.99 per MMBtu during 2009. The NYMEX crude oil market price averaged $79.53 per barrel during 2010 compared to $61.88 per barrel during 2009 – a 29% year-to-year increase. General and administrative costs were $204.8 million for 2010 compared to $182.8 million for 2009, a $22.0 million year-to-year increase. General and administrative costs for 2010 include $20.2 million of expense related to the Employee Partnership liquidations and $24.5 million of transaction expenses related to the Holdings Merger. General and administrative costs for 2009 include $31.0 million of transaction expenses related to the TEPPCO Merger. Collectively, the remainder of our general and administrative costs increased $8.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher expenses for director compensation and legal and tax professional services. 93 Table of Contents Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates was $62.0 million for 2010 compared to $92.3 million for 2009. The $30.3 million year-to-year decrease is primarily due to a $43.9 million decrease in equity earnings from Energy Transfer Equity, partially offset by improved results from our investments in midstream energy companies operating in Gulf of Mexico and higher earnings from K/D/S Promix, L.L.C. (“Promix”) and Centennial. Operating income for 2010 was $2.15 billion compared to $1.85 billion for 2009. Collectively, the changes in revenues, costs and expenses and equity income described above resulted in the $292.6 million year-to-year increase in operating income. Interest expense increased to $741.9 million for 2010 from $687.3 million for 2009, a $54.6 million year-to-year increase. Interest expense for 2010 includes $31.0 million of charges related to Holdings’ interest rate swaps and the write-off of Holdings’ unamortized debt issuance costs. The remainder of the increase in interest expense is primarily due to EPO’s issuance of Senior Notes Q and R during October 2009 and Senior Notes X, Y and Z in May 2010. Our average debt principal balance increased to $13.23 billion during 2010 from $13.0 billion during 2009. As a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs, our consolidated net income increased $243.4 million year-to-year to $1.38 billion for 2010 compared to $1.14 billion for 2009. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $1.06 billion for 2010 compared to $936.2 million for 2009. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to partners increased $116.7 million year-to-year to $320.8 million for 2010 compared to $204.1 million for 2009. The following information highlights significant year-to-year variances in gross operating margin by business segment: NGL Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $1.73 billion for 2010 compared to $1.63 billion for 2009, a $103.9 million year-to-year increase. Gross operating margin for 2009 includes $5.9 million of gains related to insurance proceeds. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding gains from insurance proceeds. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business was $989.9 million for 2010 compared to $947.9 million for 2009, a $42.0 million year-to-year increase. Equity NGL production increased to 121 MBPD during 2010 from 117 MBPD during 2009. Our Rocky Mountains natural gas processing plants contributed $31.6 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin primarily due to increased equity NGL production. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing activities in Texas increased $16.4 million year-to-year due to higher volumes and processing margins, which includes $9.8 million of gross operating margin attributable to natural gas processing activities on the Fairplay system that we acquired in May 2010. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased $4.5 million year-to-year due to higher sales volumes and margins. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our natural gas processing activities decreased $10.5 million year-to-year primarily due to lower natural gas processing margins and fee-based processing volumes in at our plants in southern Louisiana and the San Juan and Permian Basins. Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage business was $604.8 million for 2010 compared to $538.9 million for 2009, a $65.9 million year-to-year increase. Total NGL transportation volumes increased to 2,322 MBPD during 2010 from 2,196 MBPD during 2009. Collectively, gross operating margin from our Louisiana NGL pipelines and Dixie Pipeline increased $55.7 million year-to-year primarily due to a 50 MBPD increase in throughput volumes and an increase in certain fees. Gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel import/export terminal and a related pipeline increased $17.6 million year-to-year primarily due to a 46 MBPD year-to-year increase in volumes. Gross operating margin from our storage and related terminal businesses increased $29.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher storage volumes and fees, with our Mont Belvieu storage facility contributing $12.7 million of this increase. In addition, gross operating margin from our Rio Grande pipeline, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009, increased $5.3 million year-to-year. Improved results from these assets were partially offset by a combined $39.2 million decrease in gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related terminals attributable to a $29.2 million benefit recorded for the Mid-America Pipeline System in 2009 related to a rate case settlement, a combined 16 MBPD decrease in throughput volumes on these systems and higher operating expenses. Gross operating margin from our 94 Table of Contents remaining NGL pipelines decreased $2.6 million year-to-year primarily due to a $6.8 million charge we recorded during the third quarter of 2010 for a dispute involving a pipeline in South Texas. Gross operating margin from our NGL fractionation business was $137.9 million for 2010 compared to $136.0 million for 2009, a $1.9 million increase year-to-year. Our NGL fractionation volumes were 485 MBPD during 2010 compared to 461 MBPD during 2009. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu and Promix NGL fractionation facilities increased $15.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher NGL fractionation volumes and fees. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we added 75 MBPD of NGL fractionation capacity by completing and placing into service a fourth NGL fractionator at our complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Gross operating margin from the remainder of our NGL fractionators decreased $13.2 million year-to-year, primarily due to a $12.6 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin from our Norco fractionator related to hedging and operating gains recorded during 2009 that did not repeat in 2010. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $527.2 million for 2010 compared to $501.5 million for 2009, a $25.7 million year-to-year increase. Our onshore natural gas transportation volumes were 11.48 TBtus/d during 2010 compared to 10.44 TBtus/d during 2009. Gross operating margin from our onshore natural gas pipelines and related marketing business was $471.7 million for 2010 compared to $448.5 million for 2009, a $23.2 million year-to-year increase. Gross operating margin for 2010 includes $33.0 million from the State Line and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems, which we acquired in May 2010. Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System increased $22.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher firm capacity reservation fees on the Sherman Extension pipeline. Gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System increased $21.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average gathering fees and lower operating expenses during 2010 compared to 2009. Our Central Treating Facility in the Rocky Mountains, which commenced operations in March 2009, contributed $11.5 million of the year-to-year increase in segment gross operating margin. Collectively, gross operating margin from our Jonah and Carlsbad gathering systems decreased $16.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower natural gas gathering volumes. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our onshore natural gas pipelines and related marketing activities decreased $48.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins and higher transportation and storage expenses associated with our natural gas marketing activities. Natural gas basis differentials in Texas (specifically, the difference in natural gas prices between markets in West Texas and East Texas) were significantly lower during 2010 relative to 2009. The year-to-year decrease in basis differentials resulted in lower sales margins associated with our natural gas marketing activities during 2010 and a decrease in interruptible transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System. Gross operating margin from our natural gas storage business was $55.5 million for 2010 compared to $53.0 million for 2009. The $2.5 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher revenues and lower operating expenses at our Petal natural gas storage facility during 2010 compared to 2009. Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $113.7 million for 2010 compared to $164.4 million for 2009, a $50.7 million year-to-year decrease. Total onshore crude oil transportation volumes decreased to 670 MBPD during 2010 compared to 680 MBPD during 2009. Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related activities decreased $53.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins resulting from a competitive crude oil marketing environment (i.e., lower basis differentials year-to-year) and higher pipeline and truck transportation costs. Basis differentials represent the difference in crude oil prices between two locations or price differences for various qualities of crude oil (e.g., “sweet” crude versus “sour” crude). Gross operating margin from our crude oil terminal operations in Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma decreased $3.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating expenses. Collectively, gross operations from the remainder of our onshore crude oil businesses increased $6.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher throughput volumes on our West Texas pipeline system and higher volumes and fees on our Red River pipeline system. Offshore Pipelines & Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $297.8 million for 2010 compared to $180.5 million for 2009, a $117.3 million year-to-year increase. Results for 2010 include $27.5 million of gains related to insurance proceeds compared to $39.7 million of such gains in 2009. Results for 2009 95 Table of Contents include $135.3 million of charges related to our dissociation from TOPS. Gross operating margin from this business segment decreased $5.8 million year-to-year excluding the effects of insurance proceeds and charges related to TOPS. In August 2008, we, including TEPPCO, together with Oiltanking Holding Americas, Inc. (“Oiltanking”) formed TOPS. In April 2009, we and TEPPCO dissociated from TOPS and recorded a $68.4 million charge to write-off our investment in the joint venture. In September 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with certain affiliates of Oiltanking that resolved all disputes between the parties related to the business and affairs of the TOPS project. We recognized approximately $66.9 million of expense during the third quarter of 2009 in connection with the payment of this cash settlement. The following paragraphs provide a discussion of segment results excluding insurance-related gains and the charges associated with TOPS. In general, natural gas and crude oil drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico ceased as a result of the federal offshore drilling moratorium, which went into effect in May 2010. This resulted in lower throughput volumes available to certain of our offshore pipeline and platform assets. The moratorium was lifted in October 2010. Gross operating margin from our offshore crude oil pipeline business was $97.9 million for 2010 compared to $79.3 million for 2009, an $18.6 million year-to-year increase. Equity earnings from Poseidon increased $5.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes and lower operating expenses. In addition, gross operating margin from our Shenzi crude oil pipeline, which commenced operations in April 2009, increased $4.0 million year-to-year. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our crude oil pipelines increased $8.9 million year-to-year primarily due to increased transportation volumes. Certain of these pipelines were either in limited service or out-of-service completely during 2009 due to the lingering effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike on energy infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the effects of the federal offshore drilling moratorium, our offshore crude oil transportation volumes averaged 320 MBPD during 2010 compared to 308 MBPD during 2009. Gross operating margin from our offshore natural gas pipeline business was $45.5 million for 2010 compared to $54.2 million for 2009, an $8.7 million year-to-year decrease. Our offshore natural gas transportation volumes were 1,242 BBtus/d during 2010 versus 1,420 BBtus/d during 2009. Gross operating margin from our Independence Trail pipeline decreased $31.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower transportation volumes. Natural gas transportation volumes on our Independence Trail pipeline decreased to 576 BBtus/d during 2010 from 805 BBtus/d during 2009 as a result of well depletion and lost production (i.e., wells that were shut-in or watered-out) and indirect impacts of the federal offshore drilling moratorium. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our offshore natural gas pipelines increased $22.5 million year-to-year primarily due to a year-to-year decrease in operating expenses as a result of property damage repair expenses we recorded during 2009 and revenue increases on our High Island Offshore System in 2010. Gross operating margin from our offshore platform services business was $126.9 million for 2010 compared to $142.6 million for 2009, a $15.7 million year-to-year decrease. Our net platform natural gas processing volumes were 513 MMcf/d during 2010 compared to 700 MMcf/d during 2009. The year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is primarily due to lower natural gas processing volumes at our Independence Hub platform as a result of well depletion and lost production (i.e., wells that were shut-in or watered-out) and indirect impacts of the federal offshore drilling moratorium. Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Gross operating margin from this business segment was $584.5 million for 2010 compared to $364.7 million for 2009, a $219.8 million year-to-year increase. Gross operating margin from propylene fractionation and related activities was $212.4 million for 2010 compared to $89.6 million for 2009, a $122.8 million year-to-year increase. Propylene fractionation volumes increased to 77 MBPD during 2010 from 68 MBPD during 2009. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher propylene fractionation volumes and sales margins during 2010. Propylene sales margins increased year-to-year as a result of improved consumer demand for propylene derivative products and lower propylene production from third party petrochemical facilities (which impacted supply) during 2010 compared to 2009. 96 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from octane enhancement and HPIB production was $47.0 million for 2010 compared to $11.5 million for 2009, a $35.5 million year-to-year increase. Octane enhancement production volumes were 16 MBPD during 2010 compared to 10 MBPD during 2009. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher sales volumes and margins from motor gasoline additives and revenues from by-product sales. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization was $84.9 million for 2010 compared to $76.2 million for 2009, an $8.7 million year-to-year increase. Butane isomerization volumes decreased to 89 MBPD during 2010 from 97 MBPD during 2009. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher commodity prices, which resulted in increased revenues from by-product sales and more than offset the effect of lower isomerization volumes. Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related activities was $170.8 million for 2010 compared to $124.7 million for 2009, a $46.1 million year-to-year increase. Pipeline transportation volumes for the refined products business were 734 MBPD during 2010 compared to 682 MBPD during 2009. Gross operating margin for 2009 includes a $28.7 million charge recognized by TEPPCO in the third quarter of 2009 in connection with its river terminal business. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our refined products pipelines and related activities increased $17.4 million year-to-year primarily due to the expansion of our refined products marketing activities and the completion of our 5.3 million barrel refined products terminal in Port Arthur, Texas, which generated $7.4 million of gross operating margin for 2010. Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other segment services was $69.4 million for 2010 compared to $62.7 million for 2009, a $6.7 million year-to-year increase. An increase in gross operating margin attributable to earnings from acquired and constructed marine vessels was partially offset by higher operating expenses during 2010 as compared to 2009. Other Investments. Our equity earnings from Energy Transfer Equity were a loss of $2.8 million for 2010 compared to income of $41.1 million for 2009, a $43.9 million year-to-year decrease. Our equity income from this investment was reduced by $36.3 million and $36.6 million of excess cost amortization during 2010 and 2009, respectively. According to financial statements filed with the SEC, Energy Transfer Equity’s net income attributable to partners was $192.8 million and $442.5 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Energy Transfer Equity’s net income attributable to partners for 2010 included $66.4 million of charges in connection with the termination of interest rate swaps and a $52.6 million non-cash impairment charge to write-down the carrying value of its investment in Midcontinent Express Pipeline, LLC. In addition, Energy Transfer Equity’s net income for 2010 included losses of $52.4 million associated with the change in fair value of non-hedged interest rate derivatives compared to gains of $33.6 million for 2009. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2011, we had $3.37 billion of consolidated liquidity, which is defined as unrestricted cash on hand plus borrowing capacity available under our $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary cash requirements are for routine operating expenses, debt service, working capital, capital expenditures, business combinations and distributions to partners. We expect to fund our short-term cash requirements for operating expenses and sustaining capital expenditures using operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our expenditures for long-term productive assets (e.g., business expansion projects and acquisitions) are expected to be funded through a variety of sources (either separately or in combination) including the use of operating cash flows, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from divestitures and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities. We expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash flows. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and/or refinancing arrangements. Based on current market conditions, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs. Long-Term Debt In September 2011, EPO entered into a new $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility that matures in September 2016. Initial borrowings under this variable-rate credit facility were used to refinance and terminate 97 Table of Contents EPO’s prior $1.75 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. Future borrowings under the new $3.5 billion revolving credit facility may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general company purposes. EPO’s borrowings under the revolving credit facility are unsecured general obligations that are guaranteed by Enterprise and are non-recourse to Enterprise GP. As defined by the credit agreement, variable interest rates charged under this facility bear interest at a London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin. In addition, EPO is required to pay a quarterly facility fee on each lender’s commitment irrespective of commitment usage. This revolving credit facility allows us to request up to two one-year extensions of the maturity date, subject to lender approval. The total amount of the bank commitments may be increased, without the consent of the lenders, by an amount not exceeding $500 million by adding one or more lenders to the facility and/or requesting that the commitments of existing lenders be increased. We had approximately $14.48 billion of principal amounts outstanding under consolidated debt agreements at December 31, 2011. In January 2011, EPO issued $750.0 million in principal amount of 5-year unsecured notes (“Senior Notes AA”) and $750.0 million in principal amount of 30-year unsecured notes (“Senior Notes BB”). Senior Notes AA were issued at 99.901% of their principal amount, have a fixed interest rate of 3.20%, and mature in February 2016. Senior Notes BB were issued at 99.317% of their principal amount, have a fixed interest rate of 5.95%, and mature in February 2041. Net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes AA and BB were used to repay $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes B that matured in February 2011, to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s $1.75 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and for general company purposes. In August 2011, EPO issued $650.0 million in principal amount of 10-year unsecured notes (“Senior Notes CC”) and $600.0 million in principal amount of 30-year unsecured notes (“Senior Notes DD”). Senior Notes CC were issued at 99.790% of their principal amount, have a fixed interest rate of 4.05%, and mature in February 2022. Senior Notes DD were issued at 99.887% of their principal amount, have a fixed interest rate of 5.70%, and mature in February 2042. Net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes CC and DD were used to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s $1.75 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and for general company purposes. In February 2012, EPO issued $750.0 million in principal amount of 30-year unsecured Senior Notes EE. These notes were issued at 99.542% of their principal amount, have a fixed-rate of interest of 4.85% and mature on August 15, 2042. Net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes EE were used to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility (which was used to repay at maturity its $490.5 million principal amount of Senior Notes S due February 2012 and $9.5 million principal amount of TEPPCO Senior Notes due February 2012 prior to the delivery of Senior Notes EE) and for general company purposes. Our $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and each of our indentures for our public debt contain conventional financial covenants and other restrictions. For example, EPO’s ability to make distributions to Enterprise Products Partners L.P., and our ability to make distributions to our partners, would be restricted if an event of default exists or if such distributions would cause an event of default or otherwise violate a covenant under the revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility also restricts our ability to incur additional debt above certain levels. Our public debt indentures currently do not limit the amount of future indebtedness that we can create, incur, assume or guarantee. We were in compliance with the financial covenants of our consolidated debt agreements at December 31, 2011. For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Registration Statements We may issue additional equity or debt securities to assist us in meeting our future liquidity and capital spending requirements. In July 2010, Enterprise, including EPO, filed a universal shelf registration statement (the “2010 Shelf”) with the SEC. The 2010 Shelf allows Enterprise and EPO (on a standalone basis) to issue an 98 Table of Contents unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. EPO utilized the 2010 Shelf to issue its Senior Notes AA and BB in January 2011, Senior Notes CC and DD in August 2011 and Senior Notes EE in February 2012. In December 2011, Enterprise utilized the 2010 Shelf to issue 10,350,000 of its common units, including the exercise of an over-allotment option for 1,350,000 common units, at $44.68 per unit in an underwritten public offering. Total net cash proceeds from the December 2011 equity offering, including the exercise of the over-allotment option, were approximately $448.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Enterprise also has a registration statement on file with the SEC in connection with its distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”). Enterprise issued 2,241,589 common units in total under its DRIP plan during 2011, which generated net cash proceeds of $90.4 million. After taking into account the number of common units issued under this registration statement through December 31, 2011, Enterprise may issue an additional 26,173,283 common units under its DRIP. In May 2011, Enterprise’s original employee unit purchase plan (“EUPP”) reached the maximum 1,200,000 common units permitted under the plan and was terminated. In September 2011, in connection with the Duncan Merger, the Duncan Energy Partners EUPP was assumed by Enterprise and converted into a new Enterprise EUPP. Enterprise filed a registration statement with the SEC authorizing the issuance of 440,879 common units under the assumed plan. Enterprise issued 96,315 common units in total under its EUPP plans during 2011, which generated net cash proceeds of $4.0 million. The net cash proceeds received in 2011 from Enterprise’s DRIP and EUPP were used to temporarily reduce borrowings outstanding under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and for general company purposes. Credit Ratings As of February 29, 2012, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s senior unsecured debt securities were: BBB from Standard and Poor’s; Baa2 from Moody’s; and BBB from Fitch Ratings. In January 2012, Standard & Poor’s upgraded its corporate credit rating of EPO from BBB- to BBB, while maintaining its outlook for EPO’s business as “positive.” Moody’s did likewise, upgrading its credit rating of EPO from Baa3 to Baa2 and reaffirming that its outlook for EPO’s business remained “positive.” In February 2012, Fitch Ratings upgraded its corporate credit rating of EPO to BBB while maintaining its outlook for EPO’s business as “stable.” EPO’s credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. A potential downgrade of EPO’s credit ratings could result in us posting financial collateral in connection with our guaranty of Centennial’s debt, which was $51.0 million at December 31, 2011. Furthermore, we may enter into contracts in connection with our commodity and interest rate hedging activities that may require the posting of financial collateral if EPO’s credit ratings were downgraded below investment grade. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (dollars in millions). For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Item 8 of this annual report. For Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 3,330.5 $ 2,300.0 $ 2,410.3 Cash used in investing activities 2,777.6 3,251.6 1,547.7 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities (598.6 ) 961.1 (863.9 ) 99 Table of Contents Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. As a result, these cash flows are exposed to certain risks. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry. We provide products and services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemicals. The products that we process, sell, transport or store are principally used as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating; as feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing; and in the production of motor gasoline. Reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers, whether because of a decline in general economic conditions, reduced demand for the end products made with our products, or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons, could have a negative impact on our earnings and operating cash flows. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Item 1A of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts: Comparison of 2011 with 2010 Operating Activities. The $1.03 billion increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to increased profitability (e.g., our gross operating margin increased $618.7 million year-to-year) and the timing of related cash receipts and disbursements. Investing Activities. The $474.0 million decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: § Cash used for business combinations decreased $1.31 billion year-to-year, primarily due to the acquisition of the State Line and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems for approximately $1.2 billion in May 2010. § Proceeds from asset sales and related transactions increased $927.9 million year-to-year primarily due to the sale of 9,672,576 Energy Transfer Equity common units for $375.2 million and the sale of certain natural gas storage facilities for $547.8 million during 2011. § Restricted cash related to our hedging activities decreased $60.2 million (a cash inflow) during 2011 due to changes in the margin requirements of our commodity hedging positions. For 2010, restricted cash related to our hedging activities increased $35.0 million (a cash outflow). § Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs, increased $1.84 billion year-to-year primarily due to our Eagle Ford Shale and Haynesville Shale growth capital projects. For additional information regarding our capital spending program, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Spending” included within this Item 7. Financing Activities. As discussed under “Basis of Financial Statement Presentation” within this Item 7, the financial statements of Enterprise prior to the Holdings Merger were those of Holdings. As a result, cash distributions paid to partners during 2010 represent payments to the former unitholders of Holdings whereas cash distributions paid to partners during 2011 represent payments to the unitholders of Enterprise. Also, cash distributions paid to noncontrolling interests during 2010 include cash payments to the unitholders of Enterprise (other than Holdings). Cash contributions from noncontrolling interests during 2010 primarily represent proceeds from Enterprise’s equity offerings (other than purchases by Holdings). Cash used in financing activities was $598.6 million during 2011 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $961.1 million during 2010. The $1.56 billion decrease in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to the following: § On a combined basis, cash contributions from noncontrolling interests and net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units decreased $1.08 billion year-to-year. Substantially all of the cash contributions from noncontrolling interests during 2010 relate to net cash proceeds generated from the issuance of common units by Enterprise prior to the completion of the Holdings Merger. In total, Enterprise issued 100 Table of Contents 12,687,904 common units and 46,328,053 common units during 2011 and 2010, respectively, in connection with underwritten offerings and its DRIP and EUPP. § Cash distributions to partners and noncontrolling interests were a combined $2.04 billion during 2011 compared to $1.79 billion during 2010. The increase in cash distributions is primarily due to increases in the number of Enterprise’s distribution-bearing common units outstanding (including common units issued in connection with the Holdings Merger and Duncan Merger) and in its quarterly distribution rates. § Net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements decreased $191.7 million year-to-year. EPO issued $2.75 billion of new senior notes and repaid $450.0 million in senior notes during 2011 compared to the issuance of $2.0 billion in senior notes and repayment of $500.0 million in senior notes and $54.0 million of other long-term debt during 2010. In addition, net repayments under consolidated revolving credit facilities and term loans increased approximately $988.3 million year-to-year. For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Comparison of 2010 with 2009 Operating Activities. The $110.3 million decrease in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following: § Net cash flows from consolidated operations (excluding cash payments for interest, distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates and cash payments for income taxes) decreased $69.5 million year-to-year. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities is generally due to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in our operating accounts, partially offset by increased profitability (e.g., our gross operating margin increased $372.1 million year-to-year). § Cash payments for interest increased approximately $77.3 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in fixed-rate debt obligations with higher interest rates. Our average consolidated debt principal outstanding was $13.23 billion during 2010 compared to $13.0 billion during 2009. § Distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates increased $22.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher distributions received from Poseidon and Promix. In February 2010, we also began receiving distributions from Skelly-Belvieu Pipeline Company, L.L.C. § Cash payments for income taxes decreased $13.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher payments made in 2009 attributable to the Texas Margin Tax and a taxable gain arising from the sale of certain Dixie assets. Investing Activities. The $1.7 billion increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: § Cash used for business combinations increased $1.21 billion year-to-year, primarily due to the May 2010 acquisition of the State Line and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems for approximately $1.2 billion. For additional information regarding this transaction, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. § Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs, increased $435.6 million year-to-year primarily due to our Eagle Ford Shale and Haynesville Shale growth capital projects. § Restricted cash related to our hedging activities increased $35.0 million (a cash outflow) during 2010 due to changes in the margin requirements of our commodity hedging positions. For 2009, restricted cash related to our hedging activities decreased $140.2 million (a cash inflow). 101 Table of Contents § Proceeds from asset sales and related transactions increased $102.3 million year-to-year primarily due to insurance proceeds received during 2010 related to the disposal of certain offshore pipeline and platform assets and the sale of our membership interest in the general partner of Energy Transfer Equity. Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $961.1 million during 2010 compared to cash used in financing activities of $863.9 million during 2009. The $1.83 billion year-to-year change in financing activities was primarily due to the following: § Net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements increased $1.41 billion year-to-year. EPO issued $2.0 billion in senior notes during 2010 compared to $1.6 billion in senior notes and during 2009. In addition, net repayments under consolidated revolving credit facilities decreased approximately $1.07 billion year-to-year. § Cash contributions from noncontrolling interests increased $89.5 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in the offering prices of Enterprise’s common units in connection with its underwritten equity offerings in 2010 compared to those in 2009. In addition, Duncan Energy Partners issued common units in 2009, which generated $137.4 million in proceeds. Net cash proceeds from the issuance of Enterprise common units in December 2010, following the Holdings Merger, were $528.5 million. § Cash distributions paid to partners (i.e., the unitholders of Holdings prior to the Holdings Merger) increased $41.0 million year-to-year due to increases in Holdings’ quarterly distribution rates and in the number of its distribution-bearing units outstanding. § Cash distributions paid to noncontrolling interests increased $156.3 million year-to-year primarily due to increases in the number of Enterprise’s distribution-bearing common units outstanding and in its quarterly distribution rates, partially offset by the cessation of cash distributions to the former owners of TEPPCO in connection with the TEPPCO Merger. Capital Spending An integral part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are positioned to continue to expand our system of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production resulting from development activities in the Rocky Mountains, Midcontinent, Northeast and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, including the Barnett, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Marcellus and Utica Shale plays and deepwater Gulf of Mexico producing regions. See “Significant Recent Developments” within this Item 7 for information regarding our current and proposed major capital projects, including the development of our ATEX Express long-haul ethane pipeline, SEKCO crude oil pipeline and multiple projects in the Eagle Ford Shale. Although our current focus is on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. In past years, major oil and gas companies have sold non-strategic assets in the midstream energy sector in which we operate. We believe this trend will continue and expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestitures. 102 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our capital spending for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net: (1) Growth capital projects (2) $ 3,552.3 $ 1,766.2 $ 1,373.9 Sustaining capital projects (3) 290.3 235.9 192.6 Capital spending for business combinations -- 1,313.9 107.3 Investments in unconsolidated affiliates 30.0 8.0 19.6 Other investing activities 22.4 -- 1.4 Total capital spending $ 3,895.0 $ 3,324.0 $ 1,694.8 (1) On certain of our capital projects, third parties are obligated to reimburse us for all or a portion of project expenditures. The majority of such arrangements are associated with projects related to pipeline construction and production well tie-ins. Contributions in aid of construction costs were $24.9 million, $38.7 million and $17.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table are presented net of related contributions in aid of construction costs. (2) Growth capital projects either result in additional revenue streams from existing assets or expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to and major renewals of existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we spent $3.55 billion on growth capital projects, of which approximately $867 million was for the Haynesville Extension and $1.59 billion for Eagle Ford Shale projects. Based on information currently available, we estimate our consolidated capital spending for 2012 will approximate $3.8 billion, which includes estimated expenditures of $3.5 billion for growth capital projects and $315 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our forecast of consolidated capital expenditures for 2012 is based on our announced strategic operating and growth plans, which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, issuance of additional debt and equity securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital spending due to factors beyond our control, such as weather related issues, changes in supplier prices or adverse economic conditions. Furthermore, our forecast of capital spending may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include the addition of costs associated with unforeseen acquisition opportunities. Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a principal factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we currently intend to make the forecast capital expenditures noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital markets. At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.31 billion in purchase commitments outstanding that relate to our capital spending for property, plant and equipment. These commitments primarily relate to construction projects in Texas, including those in the Eagle Ford Shale and at our Mont Belvieu facility. 103 Table of Contents Pipeline Integrity Costs Our pipelines are subject to safety programs administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). This federal agency has issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines (e.g., NGL, crude oil, refined products and petrochemical pipelines) and natural gas pipelines. In general, these regulations require companies to assess the condition of their pipelines in certain high consequence areas (as defined by the regulation) and to perform any necessary repairs. The following table summarizes our pipeline integrity costs, including those attributable to DOT regulations, for the periods presented (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Expensed $ 64.7 $ 39.4 $ 44.9 Capitalized 52.6 40.4 37.7 Total $ 117.3 $ 79.8 $ 82.6 We expect the cost of our pipeline integrity program, irrespective of whether such costs are capitalized or expensed, to approximate $101.0 million in 2012. Designated Units Issued in Connection with Holdings Merger In connection with the Holdings Merger, a privately held affiliate of EPCO agreed to temporarily waive the regular quarterly cash distributions it would otherwise receive from us with respect to a certain number of our common units (the “Designated Units”) it owned over a five-year period after the merger closing date of November 22, 2010. The number of Designated Units to which the temporary distribution waiver applies is as follows for distributions paid or to be paid, if any, during the following calendar years: 30,610,000 during 2011; 26,130,000 during 2012; 23,700,000 during 2013; 22,560,000 during 2014; and 17,690,000 during 2015. Distributions paid to partners during calendar year 2011 excluded the initial 30,610,000 Designated Units; however, distributions to be paid, as applicable, to partners in calendar year 2012 (beginning with the February 2012 distribution) will exclude 26,130,000 Designated Units. As a result, the number of our distribution-bearing units increased by 4,480,000 units beginning with the February 2012 distribution and will increase in subsequent years as the number of Designated Units declines. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following describes the estimation risk currently underlying our most significant financial statement items: Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Our estimate of depreciation expense incorporates management assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected salvage values, or (iv) significant changes in the forecast life of proved reserves of applicable resource basins, if any. 104 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $22.19 billion and $19.33 billion, respectively. We recorded $776.6 million, $745.7 million and $678.1 million in depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil or refined products. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated salvage values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset’s estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes. An equity method investment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible permanent loss in value of the investment (i.e., other than a temporary decline). Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee’s industry. The carrying value of an equity method investment is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of discounted estimated cash flows expected to be derived from the investment. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment’s underlying assets. A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment of $16.7 million, $8.0 million and $29.3 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. We did not record any non-cash impairment charges related to our equity method investments in 2011, 2010 or 2009. Amortization Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Qualifying Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential identifiable intangible assets include items such as intellectual property, customer contracts and relationships, and non-compete agreements. The method used to value each intangible asset will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value we assigned to information about customers and the ability to have regular contact with them as a result of business combinations and assets purchases. These relationships may arise from formal contractual arrangements or through routine contact by sales or service representatives. The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits of the associated oil and natural gas resource basins from which the customers produce are estimated to be depleted. Our estimate of the useful life of each resource basin is predicated on a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. Our contract-based intangible assets represent rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement and the Jonah natural gas transportation contracts. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated useful 105 Table of Contents life (or term), which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of useful life are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a fractionation facility, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights, and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such agreements. If our assumptions regarding the estimated useful life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset’s unamortized cost is not recoverable due to impairment, we would be required to reduce the asset’s carrying value to its estimated fair value. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was $1.66 billion and $1.84 billion, respectively. We recorded $147.0 million, $137.6 million and $119.9 million in amortization expense associated with our intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is subject to annual impairment testing at the end of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is probable that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Goodwill impairment testing involves determining the fair value of the associated reporting unit. These fair value amounts are based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the businesses that make up the reporting unit. Such assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the businesses contained within the reporting unit, which rely on management’s estimates of operating margins, throughput volumes and similar factors; (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of a reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a charge to operating costs and expenses is required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its implied fair value. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value (i.e., by at least 10%). At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of our goodwill was $2.09 billion and $2.11 billion, respectively. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2011 or 2010; however, we did recognize a $1.3 million goodwill impairment charge in 2009. For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Revenue Recognition Policies and Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses In general, we recognize revenue from customers when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. We record revenue when sales contracts are settled (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed). For additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. We record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts as required by our established policy. Our use of estimates for certain revenues and expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of our use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue 106 Table of Contents and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for a specific period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. If the assumptions underlying our revenue and expense estimates prove to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. We review our estimates based on currently available information. 107 Table of Contents Other Items Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 (dollars in millions): Payment or Settlement due by Period Less than 1-3 4-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1) $ 14,482.7 $ 500.0 $ 2,350.0 $ 1,550.0 $ 10,082.7 Estimated cash payments for interest (2) $ 16,109.5 $ 819.6 $ 1,447.4 $ 1,265.5 $ 12,577.0 Operating lease obligations (3) $ 386.4 $ 58.3 $ 87.1 $ 70.5 $ 170.5 Purchase obligations: (4) Product purchase commitments: Estimated payment obligations: Natural gas $ 4,974.8 $ 909.4 $ 1,547.4 $ 1,311.2 $ 1,206.8 NGLs $ 6,048.0 $ 2,806.4 $ 2,411.2 $ 830.4 $ -- Crude oil $ 1,770.3 $ 1,770.3 $ -- $ -- $ -- Petrochemicals and refined products $ 2,027.8 $ 1,309.5 $ 495.6 $ 222.7 $ -- Other $ 49.7 $ 7.6 $ 14.4 $ 12.9 $ 14.8 Underlying major volume commitments: Natural gas (in BBtus) 1,738,568 321,030 547,435 456,851 413,252 NGLs (in MBbls) 88,207 42,503 35,580 10,124 -- Crude oil (in MBbls) 18,015 18,015 -- -- -- Petrochemicals and refined products (in MBbls) 28,074 17,962 6,896 3,216 -- Service payment commitments (5) $ 627.3 $ 100.3 $ 171.7 $ 147.3 $ 208.0 Capital expenditure commitments (6) $ 1,312.5 $ 1,312.5 $ -- $ -- $ -- Other long-term liabilities (7) $ 352.8 $ -- $ 72.1 $ 28.6 $ 252.1 Total $ 48,141.8 $ 9,593.9 $ 8,596.9 $ 5,439.1 $ 24,511.9 (1) Represents contractually scheduled future maturities of our consolidated debt principal obligations after taking into consideration the long-term refinancing of Senior Notes S and the TEPPCO Senior Notes due February 2012 using proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes EE on February 15, 2012.

(2) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2011, the scheduled maturities of such balances (after taking into account the issuance of Senior Notes EE and related refinancing activities as noted above), and the applicable fixed or variable interest rates paid during 2011. With respect to our variable-rate debt obligations, we applied the weighted-average interest rate paid during 2011 to determine the estimated cash payments. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for the weighted-average variable interest rates charged in 2011 under our credit agreements. In addition, our estimate of cash payments for interest gives effect to interest rate swap agreements that were in place at December 31, 2011. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding these derivative instruments. Our estimated cash payments for interest are significantly influenced by the long-term maturities of our junior subordinated notes (due August 2066 through January 2068). Our estimated cash payments for interest with respect to each junior subordinated note are based on the current fixed interest rate for each note applied to the entire remaining term through the respective maturity date. (3) Primarily represents leases of underground salt dome caverns for the storage of natural gas and NGLs, office space with affiliates of EPCO and land held pursuant to right-of-way agreements. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services as of December 31, 2011. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2011 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Primarily represents our unconditional payment obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts. (6) Represents unconditional payment obligations for services to be rendered or products to be delivered in connection with our capital spending program, including our share of the capital spending commitments of our unconsolidated affiliates. (7) As reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011, other long-term liabilities primarily represent the noncurrent portion of asset retirement obligations, deferred revenues and accrued obligations for pipeline transportation deficiency fees and interest rate derivative instruments. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. 108 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Related Party Transactions In September 2011, we completed the Duncan Merger, which was a related party transaction. See “—Significant Recent Developments—Completion of the Duncan Merger” within this Item 7 for information regarding completion of the Duncan Merger. For additional information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report as well as Item 13 of this annual report. Non-GAAP Reconciliations The following table presents a reconciliation of total segment gross operating margin to operating income and further to income before provision for income taxes for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Total segment gross operating margin $ 3,871.7 $ 3,253.0 $ 2,880.9 Adjustments to reconcile total segment gross operating margin to operating income: Depreciation, amortization and accretion in operating costs and expenses (958.7 ) (936.3 ) (809.3 ) Non-cash asset impairment charges (27.8 ) (8.4 ) (33.5 ) Operating lease expenses paid by EPCO (0.3 ) (0.7 ) (0.7 ) Gains from asset sales and related transactions in operating costs and expenses 156.0 44.4 -- General and administrative costs (181.8 ) (204.8 ) (182.8 ) Operating income 2,859.1 2,147.2 1,854.6 Other expense, net (743.6 ) (737.4 ) (689.0 ) Income before provision for income taxes $ 2,115.5 $ 1,409.8 $ 1,165.6 We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. Our non-GAAP financial measure of total segment gross operating margin should not be considered an alternative to GAAP operating income. We define total segment gross operating margin as operating income before: (i) depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses; (ii) non-cash asset impairment charges; (iii) operating lease expenses for which we did not have the payment obligation; (iv) gains and losses from asset sales and related transactions; and (v) general and administrative costs. Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses (net of the adjustments noted above) from segment revenues, with both segment totals before the elimination of intercompany transactions. In accordance with GAAP, intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, provision for income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. Regulation For information regarding the impact of federal, state or local regulatory measures on our business, see “—Regulation” under Item 1 and 2 of this annual report. 109 Table of Contents Insurance Matters For information regarding insurance matters, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Recent Accounting Developments Accounting standard setting organizations have been very active in recent years. Recently, they issued new and revised accounting guidance on a number of topics, including fair value measurements, presentation of comprehensive income, testing goodwill for impairment and balance sheet offsetting. We do not believe that adoption of this new guidance will have a material impact on our future Consolidated Financial Statements. For information regarding these recent accounting developments, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Income Tax Matter Provision for income taxes primarily relates to our state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax and the federal and state tax obligations of our consolidated subsidiaries taxed as corporations. In January 2012, we submitted applications to the Internal Revenue Service for the conversion of certain of our entities taxed as corporations into pass-through entities. If these conversions are approved, we expect to recognize an income tax benefit during the first quarter of 2012 of approximately $46.5 million, which is attributable to the difference between the deferred taxes accrued by these entities as of the date of conversion and any current income tax due in connection with the conversion. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments. Derivatives are financial instruments whose fair values are determined by changes in specified benchmarks such as interest rates or commodity prices. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at a specified measurement date. Derivative instruments typically include futures, forward contracts, swaps, options and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. We assess the risk of each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. The sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss (i.e., the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio) based upon a hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) at the dates indicated. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values. The calculated results of the sensitivity analysis model do not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming: (i) the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk; (ii) the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and (iii) the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period. When considering that the majority of our derivative portfolios are designated as hedges, the sensitivities presented in the quantitative disclosures would most often be expected to have corresponding offsets. We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. If changes in market conditions or exposures warrant, the nature and volume of derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposures being managed. 110 Table of Contents See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. Interest Rate Derivative Instruments We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain consolidated debt agreements. This strategy is a component in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. Interest rate swaps exchange the stated interest rate paid on a notional amount of existing debt for the fixed or floating interest rate stipulated in the derivative instrument. Forward starting swaps perform a similar function except that they are associated with interest rates underlying anticipated future issuances of debt. The composition of our derivative instrument portfolios may change from period-to-period depending on our hedging requirements. The following table summarizes our portfolio of interest rate swaps at December 31, 2011 (dollars in millions): Hedged Transaction Number and Type of Derivative(s) Outstanding Notional Amount Period of Hedge Rate Swap Accounting Treatment Senior Notes C 1 fixed-to-floating swap $100.0 1/04 to 2/13 6.4% to 2.3% Fair value hedge Senior Notes G 3 fixed-to-floating swaps $300.0 10/04 to 10/14 5.6% to 1.5% Fair value hedge Senior Notes P 7 fixed-to-floating swaps $400.0 6/09 to 8/12 4.6% to 2.7% Fair value hedge Senior Notes AA 10 fixed-to-floating swaps $750.0 1/11 to 2/16 3.2% to 1.3% Fair value hedge Undesignated swaps 6 floating-to-fixed swaps $600.0 5/10 to 7/14 0.4% to 2.0% Mark-to-market The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value (“FV”) of our interest rate swap portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Interest Rate Swap Portfolio Aggregate Fair Value at (1) Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2010 2011 2012 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset $ 35.3 $ 67.2 $ 76.8 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset 36.1 64.4 74.8 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Asset 34.6 70.0 78.8 (1) The portfolio’s aggregate fair value at a given date is based on a variety of factors, including the number and types of derivatives outstanding at that date, the notional value of the swaps and associated interest rates. In February 2012, we settled eleven fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps having an aggregate notional amount of $800.0 million, resulting in gains totaling $41.7 million. These gains will be amortized to earnings (as a decrease in interest expense) using the effective interest method over the forecasted hedged period. The following table summarizes our portfolio of forward starting swaps at December 31, 2011 (dollars in millions): Hedged Transaction Number and Type of Derivatives Employed Notional Amount Expected Termination Date Average Rate Locked Accounting Treatment Future debt offering 10 forward starting swaps (1) $500.0 2/12 4.5% Cash flow hedge Future debt offering 7 forward starting swaps $350.0 8/12 3.7% Cash flow hedge Future debt offering 16 forward starting swaps $1,000.0 3/13 3.7% Cash flow hedge (1) These swaps were settled in February 2012 in connection with the issuance of Senior Notes EE (see below). 111 Table of Contents The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value (“FV”) of our forward starting swap portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Forward Starting Swap Portfolio Aggregate Fair Value at (1) Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2010 2011 2012 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) $ 19.2 $ (290.7 ) $ (316.6 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) 80.0 (251.8 ) (279.7 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Liability (44.3 ) (330.6 ) (354.4 ) (1) The portfolio’s aggregate fair value at a given date is based on a variety of factors, including the number and types of derivatives outstanding at that date, the notional value of the swaps and associated interest rates. Due to a decrease in forward London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”) in 2011, the fair value of our forward starting swap portfolio was a liability of $290.7 million at December 31, 2011 and $316.6 million at January 31, 2012. In connection with the issuance of Senior Notes EE in February 2012, we settled ten forward starting swaps having an aggregate notional value of $500.0 million, resulting in losses totaling $115.3 million. These losses will be reflected in other comprehensive income for the first quarter of 2012 and amortized to earnings (as an increase in interest expense) using the effective interest method over the forecasted hedge period of ten years. Any gain or loss ultimately recognized upon settlement of the remaining forward starting swaps would be amortized into earnings as a reduction or increase, respectively, in interest expense over the forecasted hedge period. Commodity Derivative Instruments The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward agreements, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps, basis swaps and options contracts. Our predominant hedging strategies are: (i) hedging natural gas processing margins; (ii) hedging anticipated future contracted sales of NGLs, refined products and crude oil associated with volumes held in inventory and (iii) hedging the fair value of natural gas in inventory. The following information summarizes these hedging strategies: § The objective of our natural gas processing strategy is to hedge an amount of gross margin associated with our natural gas processing activities. We achieve this objective by using physical and financial instruments to lock in the purchase prices of natural gas consumed as PTR and the sales prices of the related NGL products. This program consists of (i) the forward sale of a portion of our expected equity NGL production at fixed prices through June 2012, which is achieved through the use of forward physical sales contracts and commodity derivative instruments and (ii) the purchase of commodity derivative instruments having a notional amount based on the volume of natural gas expected to be consumed as PTR in the production of such equity NGL production. At December 31, 2011, this program had hedged future remaining estimated gross margins (before plant operating expenses) of $108.6 million on 4.2 MMBbls of forecasted NGL forward sales transactions and equivalent PTR volumes extending through June 2012. At January 31, 2012, this program had hedged future estimated gross margins (before plant operating expenses) of $311.6 million on 7.7 MMBbls of forecasted NGL forward sales transactions and equivalent PTR volumes extending through December 2012. Our estimates of future gross margins are subject to various business risks, including unforeseen production outages or declines, counterparty risk, or similar events or developments that are outside of our control. § The objective of our NGL, refined products and crude oil sales hedging program is to hedge the margins of anticipated future sales of inventory by locking in sales prices through the use of forward physical sales contracts and commodity derivative instruments. 112 Table of Contents § The objective of our natural gas inventory hedging program is to hedge the fair value of natural gas currently held in inventory by locking in the sales price of the inventory through the use of commodity derivative instruments. Certain basis swaps, basis spread options and other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are used to manage market risks associated with anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas necessary to optimize our owned and contractually committed transportation and storage capacity. There is some uncertainty involved in the timing of these transactions often due to the development of more favorable profit opportunities or when spreads are insufficient to cover variable costs thus reducing the likelihood that the transactions will occur as originally forecasted. As a result of this timing uncertainty, these derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting even though they are effective at managing the risk exposures of these assets. The earnings volatility caused by fluctuations in non-cash, mark-to-market earnings cannot be predicted and the impact to earnings could be material. The following table summarizes our commodity derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2011: Volume (1) Accounting Derivative Purpose Current (2) Long-Term (2) Treatment Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas processing: Forecasted natural gas purchases for plant thermal reduction (“PTR”) (3) 12.6 Bcf n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs (4) 2.0 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Octane enhancement: Forecasted purchases of NGLs 0.3 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of octane enhancement products 0.9 MMBbls 0.1 MMBbls Cash flow hedge Natural gas marketing: Natural gas storage inventory management activities 9.3 Bcf n/a Fair value hedge NGL marketing: Forecasted purchases of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products 4.2 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products 3.6 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Refined products marketing: Forecasted purchases of refined products 0.8 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of refined products 1.6 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Crude oil marketing: Forecasted purchases of crude oil 0.4 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of crude oil 1.0 MMBbls n/a Cash flow hedge Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas risk management activities (5,6) 354.2 Bcf 58.3 Bcf Mark-to-market Refined products risk management activities (6) 0.6 MMBbls n/a Mark-to-market Crude oil risk management activities (6) 5.4 MMBbls n/a Mark-to-market (1) Volume for derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflects the total amount of volumes hedged whereas volume for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflects the absolute value of derivative notional volumes. (2) The maximum term for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is December 2013, May 2012 and December 2013, respectively. (3) PTR represents the British thermal unit equivalent of the NGLs extracted from natural gas by a processing plant, and includes the natural gas used as plant fuel to extract those liquids, plant flare and other shortages. (4) Forecasted sales of NGL volumes under natural gas processing exclude 2.2 MMBbls of additional hedges executed under contracts that have been designated as normal sales agreements. (5) Current volumes include approximately 87.8 Bcf of physical derivative instruments that are predominantly priced at an index plus a premium or minus a discount related to location differences. (6) Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with transportation, processing and storage assets. 113 Table of Contents The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our natural gas marketing portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2010 2011 2012 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ (12.4 ) $ 22.2 $ 20.6 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (21.5 ) 14.9 14.0 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (3.3 ) 29.5 27.2 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our NGL, refined products and petrochemical operations portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2010 2011 2012 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Liability $ (40.3 ) $ (12.3 ) $ (20.5 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Liability (104.5 ) (32.2 ) (61.0 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 24.0 7.6 20.1 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our crude oil marketing portfolio at the dates presented (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Resulting December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario Classification 2010 2011 2012 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ 1.8 $ (7.6 ) $ (1.5 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Liability (0.3 ) (10.0 ) (4.0 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 4.0 (5.0 ) 1.1 Product Purchase Commitments We have long and short-term purchase commitments for natural gas, NGLs, petrochemicals and other hydrocarbons with several suppliers.

We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids (""NGLs"") related businesses of EPCO and are now a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the U.S., Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. Our midstream energy operations include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and import and export terminals; crude oil gathering and transportation, storage and terminals; offshore production platforms; petrochemical and refined products transportation and services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems and in the Gulf of Mexico. Our assets include approximately 50,000 miles of onshore and offshore pipelines; 200 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, petrochemicals, refined products and crude oil; and 14 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity. In addition, our asset portfolio includes 24 natural gas processing plants, 21 NGL and propylene fractionators, six offshore hub platforms located in the Gulf of Mexico, a butane isomerization complex, NGL import and export terminals, and octane enhancement and high-purity isobutylene production facilities. We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the ""ASA"") or by other service providers. We have five reportable business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services; (ii) Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services; (iii) Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services; (iv) Offshore Pipelines & Services; and (v) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. All activities included in our former sixth reportable business segment, Other Investments, ceased on January 18, 2012, which was the date we discontinued using the equity method to account for our previously held investment in Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (""Energy Transfer Equity""). For additional information regarding the divestiture of our investment in Energy Transfer Equity, see ""Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidation of Investment in Energy Transfer Equity"" within this Item 7. We completed the Duncan and Holdings Mergers in September 2011 and November 2010, respectively. We believe these recent merger transactions streamlined and simplified our organizational structure to be more transparent to investors, removed potential conflicts of interest due to common control considerations and reduced public company overhead costs. For additional information regarding these business combinations, see ""Duncan and Holdings Mergers"" under Part I, Item 1 and 2 of this annual report. For information regarding our directors and executive officers, see Part III, Item 10 of this annual report. Basis of Financial Statement Presentation As a result of the November 2010 merger of Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. (""Holdings"") with and into one of our wholly owned subsidiaries (the ""Holdings Merger""), Enterprise's consolidated financial and operating results prior to November 22, 2010 have been presented as if Enterprise were Holdings from an accounting perspective (i.e., the financial statements of Holdings became the historical financial statements of Enterprise). Since we historically consolidated Duncan Energy Partners L.P. (""Duncan Energy Partners"") for financial reporting purposes, the September 2011 merger of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries with and into Duncan Energy Partners (the ""Duncan Merger"") did not change the basis of presentation of our historical financial statements. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding the basis of presentation of our general purpose financial statements. 69 Table of Contents Significant Recent Developments The following information highlights significant commercial and operational developments during 2012 and through the date of this filing (March 1, 2013). For information regarding recent offerings of our equity and debt securities, see ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" within this Item 7. Enterprise Begins Service at ECHO Crude Oil Terminal In November 2012, the initial phase of our Enterprise Crude Houston (or ""ECHO"") storage terminal located in southeast Houston, Texas was partially completed and started receiving deliveries of crude oil. Completion of this first phase provides us with approximately 0.5 MMBbls of crude oil storage capacity (two tanks) at the site. A third tank was completed and placed into service in February 2013. An additional 0.9 MMBbls of storage capacity is expected to be in service as early as the second quarter of 2014. When fully developed, we estimate that the ECHO terminal could have up to 6.0 MMBbls of crude oil storage capacity. Formation of Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline Joint Venture with Plains In August 2012, we announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, Eagle Ford Pipeline LLC, with Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (""Plains"") to provide crude oil pipeline services to producers in South Texas. The arrangement provides for Enterprise and Plains to consolidate certain segments of previously announced pipeline projects servicing the Eagle Ford Shale supply basin. The joint venture pipeline system is supported by long-term commitments from producers totaling up to 210 MBPD of crude oil. This joint venture is expected to provide shippers with increased market flexibility and enable Enterprise and Plains to optimize their respective capital investments in the area. The joint venture will include a 140-mile crude oil and condensate line extending from Gardendale, Texas in LaSalle County to Three Rivers, Texas in Live Oak County and continuing on to Corpus Christi, Texas, and a newly constructed 35-mile pipeline segment from Three Rivers to our Lyssy, Texas station in Wilson County. The system, which is currently under construction, is expected to have a capacity of 350 MBPD and will include a marine terminal facility at Corpus Christi and 1.8 MMBbls of operational storage capacity across the system. Segments of the new pipeline system are expected to be placed into service in the first quarter of 2013, with the balance of the system expected to be placed into service in the third quarter of 2013. Plains will serve as operator of the joint venture's pipeline system. At Lyssy, the joint venture pipeline will interconnect with the Eagle Ford expansion of our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System, which commenced operations in June 2012 (see below). Our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System is not part of the new joint venture's pipeline system. Plans to Build World-Scale Propane Dehydrogenation Unit In June 2012, we announced plans to build one of the world's largest propane dehydrogenation (""PDH"") units, with capacity to produce up to 1.65 billion pounds per year, which equates to approximately 750 thousand metric tons per year or 25 MBPD, of polymer grade propylene. The PDH facility is expected to consume up to 35 MBPD of propane as feedstock and be located in southeast Texas along the Gulf Coast. The new facility will be integrated with our existing propylene fractionation facilities, which will provide operational reliability and flexibility for both the PDH facility and the fractionation facilities. The PDH facility will also be integrated with our polymer grade propylene storage facilities, pipeline system and export terminal. The PDH facility, which is supported by long-term, fee-based contracts, is expected to begin commercial operations during the third quarter of 2015. We are in discussions with additional customers that could lead to the development of additional PDH capacity. Eagle Ford Expansion of Our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System Commences Operations In June 2012, we announced that the Eagle Ford expansion of our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System commenced operations. This pipeline expansion, which has a crude oil transportation capacity of 350 MBPD, 70 Table of Contents allows us to serve growing production areas in the Eagle Ford Shale supply basin. The new pipeline originates at our Lyssy station in Karnes County, Texas and extends 147 miles to Sealy, Texas and includes 2.4 MMBbls of crude oil storage, including 0.8 MMBbls in Karnes County, Texas, 0.4 MMBbls in Gonzales County, Texas and 1.2 MMBbls at Sealy. Crude oil supplies arriving at Sealy on the new pipeline are being delivered to Houston area refiners through affiliate and third party owned pipelines. In addition, shippers have access to our new ECHO crude oil storage terminal. Seaway Pipeline Developments In June 2012, we and Enbridge Inc. announced that the Seaway Pipeline made its first delivery of crude oil to the Texas Gulf Coast. The arrival marked the first southbound delivery of crude oil by pipeline from the Cushing hub, and gives producers access to all of the major refineries in the Greater Houston area and Texas City. Additional pump station additions and modifications, which were completed in January 2013, are expected to increase the pipeline's throughput capacity. In March 2012, we secured capacity commitments from shippers to proceed with an additional expansion of the Seaway Pipeline. This expansion project entails the construction of a 512-mile, 30-inch diameter pipeline mostly along the existing route of the Seaway Pipeline. It is anticipated that the new pipeline will commence operations during the first quarter of 2014. The Seaway Pipeline delivers crude oil from Cushing into the Houston and Texas City, Texas market utilizing affiliate and third party pipelines. Seaway Crude Pipeline Company LLC (""Seaway"") is constructing a 65-mile pipeline that will link its pipeline system to our ECHO crude oil storage terminal. Completion of this pipeline segment is expected in the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition, Seaway plans to build an 85-mile pipeline from our ECHO terminal to the Port Arthur/Beaumont, Texas refining center that would provide shippers access to the region's heavy oil refining capabilities. Completion of this pipeline segment is expected in mid-2014. For additional information regarding the Seaway Pipeline, see our discussion of the Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment under Part I, Item 1 and 2 of this annual report. Yoakum Natural Gas Processing Plant Begins Operations in Eagle Ford Shale In May 2012, we announced that the first phase (or ""train"") of our new cryogenic natural gas processing plant at Yoakum, Texas commenced operations. The second train commenced operations in late August 2012. In the aggregate, these two processing trains are processing up to a combined 700 MMcf/d of natural gas and extracting over 90 MBPD of NGLs. The third and final train at the Yoakum facility, which is the same size as each of the first two trains, is currently undergoing commissioning operations and is expected to be fully operational in March 2013. In April 2012, we completed a 65-mile residue natural gas pipeline linking the Yoakum plant to our Wilson natural gas storage facility and numerous third party markets. In addition, we recently completed construction of 168 miles of pipelines that will transport mixed NGLs extracted at the Yoakum plant to our NGL fractionation and storage complex at Mont Belvieu, Texas. We are also constructing a 173-mile NGL pipeline that will extend from our Yoakum facility to LaSalle County, Texas, and provide NGL connectivity to additional natural gas processing plants. This pipeline extension is expected to begin service during the second quarter of 2013. Plans to Construct Front Range Pipeline In April 2012, we, along with WGR Asset Holding Company LLC, an affiliate of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, and DCP Midstream Front Range LLC formed a new joint venture, Front Range, to design and construct a new NGL pipeline that will originate in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (the ""DJ Basin"") in Weld County, Colorado and extend 435 miles to Skellytown in Carson County, Texas. Each party holds a one-third ownership interest in the joint venture. The Front Range Pipeline, with connections to our Mid-America Pipeline System and the Texas Express Pipeline, will provide producers in the DJ Basin with access to the Gulf Coast, the largest NGL market in the U.S. Initial capacity on the Front Range Pipeline will be 150 MBPD, which can be readily expanded to 230 MBPD. We will construct and operate the pipeline, which is expected to begin service in the fourth quarter of 2013. 71 Table of Contents Expansion of NGL Fractionation Capacity at Mont Belvieu In March 2012, we announced plans to construct two additional NGL fractionators at our Mont Belvieu, Texas complex (NGL fractionators seven and eight) that are expected to provide us with 170 MBPD of incremental NGL fractionation capacity. The two new fractionation units (each with 85 MBPD of expected capacity) are forecast to commence operations during the fourth quarter of 2013 and support the continued growth of NGL production from resource basins such as the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas and various production areas in the Rocky Mountains and the Mid-Continent. In early November 2012, construction of our sixth NGL fractionator at Mont Belvieu was completed and it commenced operations. This plant is supported by long-term customer commitments and has a capacity of approximately 85 MBPD. Completion of this plant increased the total NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex to approximately 485 MBPD. Once NGL fractionators seven and eight are constructed and placed in service, our total gross NGL fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu (then eight units in total) would approximate 655 MBPD. At that time, our system-wide fractionation capacity is expected to exceed 1.0 MMBPD. Development of Our ATEX Express Ethane Pipeline In January 2012, we secured sufficient transportation commitments to support development of our 1,230-mile Appalachia-to-Texas pipeline (the ""ATEX Express""), which will transport growing ethane production from the Marcellus and Utica Shale producing areas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. We received additional volume commitments during the third quarter of 2012. Demand for ethane feedstock over more expensive crude oil-based derivatives within the Gulf Coast petrochemical market has reached over 1 MMBPD. Several petrochemical companies have made announcements to modify, expand or build new facilities that would use ethane as a feedstock. As currently designed, the ATEX Express will have the capacity to transport up to 190 MBPD of ethane from Appalachian production areas to our storage and distribution assets in southeast Texas. The project would utilize a combination of new and existing infrastructure. The northern portion of the ATEX Express involves construction of a pipeline that would originate in Pennsylvania and extend west, then southwest, to Indiana following existing pipeline corridors in order to minimize the environmental footprint of the project. The southern portion of ATEX Express would utilize a portion of our existing TE Products Pipeline, which would be transferred to ATEX Express and reversed to accommodate southbound delivery of ethane to the U.S. Gulf Coast. At the southern terminus of the ATEX Express in Beaumont, we plan to construct a 55-mile pipeline to provide shippers with access to our NGL storage complex at Mont Belvieu, which would provide them with direct and indirect access to every ethylene plant in the U.S. We expect that the ATEX Express will begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2014. Plans to Construct a Crude Oil Pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico with Genesis In January 2012, we executed transportation agreements with six Gulf of Mexico producers that will support construction of a 149-mile crude oil gathering pipeline serving the Lucius oil and gas field located in the southern Keathley Canyon area of the deepwater central Gulf of Mexico. The pipeline will be constructed and owned by Southeast Keathley Canyon Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (""SEKCO""), a 50/50 joint venture owned by us and Genesis Energy, L.P. We will serve as construction manager and operator of the new deepwater crude oil pipeline (the ""SEKCO Oil Pipeline""), which is expected to have a capacity of 115 MBPD. The SEKCO Oil Pipeline is expected to begin service by mid-2014. 72 Table of Contents General Outlook for 2013 Commercial Outlook We provide midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals. Factors that can affect the demand for our products and services include global and U.S. economic conditions, the market price and demand for energy, the cost to develop natural gas and crude oil reserves in the U.S., state and federal regulation, and the cost and availability of capital to energy companies to invest in exploration and production activities. As a result of the current relative prices of crude oil and NGLs compared to the price of natural gas, exploration and production companies continue to focus their drilling activities on shale and other non-conventional resource plays that can produce crude oil and/or NGL-rich natural gas. Based on prices quoted on the futures markets in January 2013, natural gas prices for 2013 are currently priced at approximately 21% relative to the price of crude oil on an energy equivalent basis. In 2012, natural gas was priced at 17% of crude oil on an energy equivalent basis. In general, producers continue to decrease their drilling activity in onshore areas where natural gas production is considered ""dry"" or ""lean"" (i.e., the amount of NGLs produced in connection with the natural gas is relatively small). This same trend is also occurring in the Gulf of Mexico, with producers investing capital to develop new sources of crude oil production rather than natural gas. In recent years, natural gas and NGLs have had a significant feedstock price advantage over more costly crude oil derivatives (such as naphtha), and this trend is expected to continue based on prices quoted on the futures markets in January 2013. This trend is supported by several factors including: (i) geopolitical risk in many areas of the world that are major exporters of crude such as the Middle East; (ii) growing demand for crude oil by China, India and other developing economies; (iii) technological breakthroughs in drilling techniques used by exploration and production companies in connection with shale resource plays in the U.S., which have significantly increased U.S. oil, natural gas and NGL resources and lowered associated finding and development costs; and (iv) the general inability to export natural gas from the U.S attributable to significant capital requirements, long construction timeframes, and permitting and regulatory issues. Many domestic energy producers and energy consumers in the petrochemical, industrial manufacturing and power generation sectors are strategically repositioning their companies accordingly. We believe this trend in domestic energy production has led to a long-term fundamental change in feedstock selection by the U.S. petrochemical industry, which is the largest consumer of NGLs. Lower NGL feedstock costs have provided U.S. ethylene producers with an inherent global cost advantage, as ethylene crackers in Europe and Asia are mostly limited to using higher-priced naphtha feedstocks (which are priced more closely to crude oil). From 2009 through 2012, ethane and propane have consistently been the most profitable feedstocks in the production of ethylene, and are forecasted to remain so in 2013. The production cost advantage enjoyed by U.S. petrochemical companies has led them to maximize their consumption of NGLs in the production of ethylene. Since 2009, many of these companies have expanded their operations in the U.S. and are continuing to build flexibility into their existing operations in order to increase their consumption of NGLs (as economically warranted). In addition, non-U.S. based ethylene crackers have responded to the NGL feedstock cost advantage by importing propane, including propane produced in the U.S., to displace crude oil derivatives such as naphtha as feedstock. Because of the size of U.S. shale-related resources, international petrochemical companies have shown interest in the potential to export ethane from the U.S. In addition, with much of the U.S. petrochemical industry switching to cracking larger amounts of ethane for ethylene production (which yields fewer by-products such as propylene and butadiene) a number of projects, including our own PDH facility, have been announced. These plants specifically target making these by-products and also consume NGLs. Based on industry publications, domestic production of ethylene in 2012 averaged approximately 144 million pounds per day, which is a 1.0% decrease from 2011 levels. This slight decrease was due in part to certain ethylene producers electing to take extended turnarounds to modify facilities to increase their capacity to use ethane as a feedstock. In 2012, the average ethane and propane consumption of U.S. ethylene producers was approximately 73 Table of Contents 937 MBPD and 425 MBPD, respectively, which represents an increase of 7 MBPD and 55 MBPD, respectively, over 2011 levels. Ethylene producers consumed a record amount of propane in 2012 when the price of propane was lower relative to that of ethane and taking into account the value of co-products produced when propane is used to manufacture ethylene. As a result, ethane demand by ethylene producers in 2012 was somewhat limited by this increased use of propane. During 2012, the U.S. ethylene industry increased its capacity to use ethane as a feedstock by approximately 10% to 1.1 MMBPD. We believe the U.S. ethylene industry could consume approximately 250 MBPD of additional ethane feedstocks over the next three years through modifications and expansions of and the elimination of bottlenecks at existing facilities. In addition, several petrochemical companies have announced plans to construct additional world-scale ethylene plants in the U.S. in the coming years. Because of the market prices of crude oil and NGLs, drilling activity in 2013 is expected to remain robust in shale plays containing crude oil, condensate and NGL-rich natural gas production such as the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara, Mississippian, Wolfcamp, Woodford, Marcellus and Utica Shales. Conversely, drilling activity in shale plays with predominantly dry natural gas production, such as the Haynesville/Bossier and Fayetteville Shales, is down from peak levels. When natural gas prices improve, we believe that drilling activity in these dry gas plays will improve. As a result of producers allocating more of their capital budgets to developing NGL-rich natural gas shale plays and their success in extracting such resources, ethane production has increased more rapidly than the ethylene industry's current capability to consume the increase in supplies. This oversupplied situation contributed to a decrease in ethane prices in 2012 when compared to 2011. Ethane prices averaged $0.40 per gallon in 2012 compared to $0.77 per gallon in 2011. Moreover, ethane prices in the fourth quarter of 2012 averaged $0.28 per gallon compared to $0.86 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2011. We believe this ethane oversupply situation may generally persist until ethylene producers increase their capacity to consume additional ethane feedstock volumes through plant modifications and expansions and the completion of recently announced new ethylene plants. In the near term, this ethane oversupply situation may result in volatile ethane prices and prolonged periods of ethane rejection by producers and natural gas processors in an effort to balance supply and demand. This could lower the value of our equity NGL production and reduce the volumes that would otherwise be handled by our NGL fractionators and pipelines. Based on forecasts of drilling activity, the number of wells waiting to be connected to our pipeline systems, and natural depletion of the associated resource basins, we believe that aggregate natural gas pipeline volumes transported by our Jonah Gathering System, Piceance Basin Gathering System and San Juan Gathering System for 2013 could decrease between 5% and 12% compared to volumes transported in 2012. These declines may be mitigated in future years since these areas (including prospects to develop additional unconventional production from geologic formations such as the NGL-rich Mancos and Niobrara Shales) have substantial, undeveloped natural gas reserves with some of the lowest finding costs in the U.S. and are supported by existing pipeline infrastructure to transport the natural gas to market. We believe that as U.S. natural gas and ethane supplies and demand becomes more balanced and natural gas and ethane prices become less volatile, these producing basins could experience an increase in drilling activity to support, and potentially increase, current production levels. In the Eagle Ford Shale, which runs parallel to the Texas Gulf Coast and adjacent to our Texas Intrastate System, we have completed several pipeline projects that enable us to gather, transport and process approximately 1.0 Bcf/d of new natural gas production from the area. In general, energy companies are continuing to have significant success in the Eagle Ford Shale and have accelerated their associated drilling programs. Production from this region includes crude oil, condensate, NGL-rich natural gas and dry natural gas. Since 2010, we have announced expansions of our natural gas pipeline, storage and processing facilities; NGL pipeline and fractionation facilities; and crude oil pipeline and storage facilities to accommodate production growth from this region. These projects represent approximately $4.0 billion of capital expenditures in the aggregate from 2010 through 2013. We estimate that crude oil volumes handled by our offshore Gulf of Mexico assets will begin to recover in 2013 from the lower volumes experienced since 2010. Producers continue to increase drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico following federal regulatory uncertainty in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon/Macondo incident in 74 Table of Contents 2010. Our offshore crude pipelines transported approximately 336 MBPD of crude oil in the fourth quarter of 2012, which is the highest volume since the first quarter of 2010 and prior to the Deepwater Horizon/Macondo incident. We expect that throughput volumes on our offshore Gulf of Mexico natural gas pipelines will continue to decline in 2013 due to producers focusing more of their near term resources to exploiting onshore and offshore crude oil developments and onshore NGL-rich natural gas producing areas. Based on producer forecasts, we estimate average volumes on our largest offshore natural gas asset, the Independence Hub platform, will approximate 100 MMcf/d during 2013 compared to an average of 313 MMcf/d and 455 MMcf/d during 2012 and 2011, respectively. We believe that as U.S. natural gas supply and demand becomes more balanced and natural gas prices become less volatile, the area near the Independence Hub platform could experience an increase in drilling activity to support, and potentially increase, our estimate of future production levels. Producers connected to our Independence Hub platform paid us $54.6 million of demand fees annually for five years beginning in March 2007 until that period expired in March 2012. The Independence Hub platform now earns its revenue based on the volume it handles. Enterprise owns 80% of the Independence Hub platform. Price differentials between West Texas Intermediate (""WTI"") and Brent crude oil were much wider than normal in 2011, as crude oil production from sources north of the Cushing hub in Oklahoma, including the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and the Canadian Oil Sands, increased without adequate incremental pipeline capacity to transport such supplies to markets along the Gulf Coast. The WTI-Brent pricing spread reached as high as $27 per barrel in October 2011, but contracted somewhat after we and Enbridge announced in November 2011 our plans to reverse and expand the Seaway Pipeline in order to move crude oil from the Cushing hub to the Gulf Coast. In addition to reversal of the Seaway Pipeline, the first phase of which was completed in June 2012, a significant amount of rail capacity was added in 2011 and 2012 in order to move crude from the producing areas and the Cushing hub to refining centers on the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the U.S. Because of the growing availability of domestic crudes, the utilization rate of U.S. Gulf Coast refineries has been increasing as have their exports of petroleum products into global markets. As a result, many refineries are modifying and expanding their facilities in order to process more North American crude oil. We expect North American crude oil supplies to continue to displace imported crude oil volumes, especially imports of light, sweet grades of crude oil. We also expect the U.S. refining industry to continue to evolve based on the growing availability of these new competitively priced crude oils. Our TE Products Pipeline and related Centennial Pipeline transport refined products produced by refineries on the Gulf Coast to markets in the Midwest and Northeast U.S. As a result of increased refinery production in the Midwest and lower overall demand for refined products within these markets, demand to transport refined products to these markets on our pipelines has decreased. We expect this trend to continue; however, management is actively pursuing projects that will convert portions of these pipeline systems to alternate uses such as the southbound transportation of ethane from the Marcellus and Utica Shale producing areas using the ATEX Express pipeline. The ATEX Express pipeline includes the conversion of one of the two parallel pipelines of the TE Products Pipeline. We expect that the ATEX Express will begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2014. In conclusion, despite periods of ethane rejection, we believe that end-user demand for NGLs and increases in NGL-rich natural gas production from shale and other non-conventional resource plays will maintain the utilization rates of our NGL fractionators, pipelines, storage and export facilities and certain of our natural gas pipelines and processing plants during 2013. With approximately $7.2 billion of major organic growth projects currently under construction, we are well positioned for future growth through 2015, and our partnership's large geographic asset footprint continues to provide us with additional growth opportunities. These fee-based projects, anchored by long-term customer agreements, will serve producers in the developing Eagle Ford, Marcellus/Utica, Niobrara, Granite Wash and Barnett shale plays, and provide important energy feedstocks to petrochemical facilities, crude oil refineries and other energy intensive industries. Liquidity Outlook The corporate debt and equity capital markets were accessible in 2012. Sovereign credit markets, however, continue to be volatile due to large budget deficits being incurred by the U.S., United Kingdom and many European countries. The cost of our term debt and equity capital declined and the availability of term debt and equity capital improved. Likewise, the general availability of credit commitments from most banks also improved from a year 75 Table of Contents ago, except for certain investment banks and European banks, which are being impacted by their cost of capital and sovereign debt concerns. At December 31, 2012, we had $3.17 billion of consolidated liquidity, which is defined as unrestricted cash on hand plus borrowing capacity available under our $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In January 2013, affiliates of EPCO expressed their willingness to purchase at least $100 million of our common units from us in 2013 principally through our distribution reinvestment plan (""DRIP""). The first such purchase was for approximately $25 million and was completed through the reinvestment of distributions we paid to EPCO affiliates in February 2013. On February 1, 2013, we retired a total of $550 million of senior notes that matured. The average interest rate for these retired notes was approximately 6.28%. We initially retired these notes by issuing short-term notes under our commercial paper program. We currently estimate that our capital expenditures for 2013 will approximate $4.4 billion, which includes approximately $4 billion for growth capital projects and $350 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Based on current market conditions, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs. As of the filing date of this report, we have approximately $3.1 billion of senior notes maturing in the period beginning April 1, 2013 through the end of 2015. The U.S. government is expected to continue to run substantial annual budget deficits that will require a corresponding issuance of debt by the U.S. Treasury from 2013 through 2015. The interest rate on U.S. Treasury debt has a direct impact on the cost of our debt. At this time, we are uncertain what the impact of the expected large issuances of U.S. Treasury debt and the prevailing economic and capital market conditions during these future periods will have on the cost and availability of capital. At this time, we have not executed any interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our expected future debt issuances in connection with the refinancing of our debt. We continue to monitor and evaluate the condition of the capital markets and our interest rate risk with respect to refinancing these maturities and funding our capital expenditures. In February 2013, we issued 9,200,000 of our common units in a public offering (including an over-allotment amount of 1,200,000 common units) resulting in net proceeds of approximately $486.6 million. In March 2013, we expect to sell the Stratton Ridge-to-Mont Belvieu segment of the Seminole Pipeline, along with a related storage cavern, to a third party for $87.1 million in cash. As a result, our first quarter of 2013 net income is expected to include an approximate $53 million gain from the disposal of these assets. The Seminole Pipeline remains connected to our Mont Belvieu complex through a newly constructed pipeline segment that we own. 76 Table of Contents Results of Operations Summarized Consolidated Income Statement Data The following table summarizes the key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Revenues $ 42,583.1 $ 44,313.0 $ 33,739.3 Costs and expenses: Operating costs and expenses: Cost of sales 36,015.5 38,292.6 28,723.1 Other operating costs and expenses 2,244.9 2,195.4 1,825.9 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 1,061.7 958.7 936.3 Gains attributable to disposal of assets (17.6 ) (156.0 ) (44.4 ) Non-cash asset impairment charges 63.4 27.8 8.4 Total operating costs and expenses 39,367.9 41,318.5 31,449.3 General and administrative costs 170.3 181.8 204.8 Total costs and expenses 39,538.2 41,500.3 31,654.1 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 64.3 46.4 62.0 Operating income 3,109.2 2,859.1 2,147.2 Interest expense (771.8 ) (744.1 ) (741.9 ) Other, net 73.4 0.5 4.5 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes 17.2 (27.2 ) (26.1 ) Net income 2,428.0 2,088.3 1,383.7 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (8.1 ) (41.4 ) (1,062.9 ) Net income attributable to limited partners $ 2,419.9 $ 2,046.9 $ 320.8 Consolidated Revenues by Business Segment The following table presents each business segment's contribution to revenues (net of eliminations and adjustments) for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 NGL Pipelines & Services: Sales of NGLs and related products $ 14,218.5 $ 16,724.6 $ 13,449.4 Midstream services 949.9 758.7 753.1 Total 15,168.4 17,483.3 14,202.5 Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services: Sales of natural gas 2,395.4 2,866.5 2,928.7 Midstream services 957.2 863.7 772.9 Total 3,352.6 3,730.2 3,701.6 Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services: Sales of crude oil 17,548.7 15,962.6 10,710.4 Midstream services 113.0 98.5 84.4 Total 17,661.7 16,061.1 10,794.8 Offshore Pipelines & Services: Sales of natural gas 0.4 1.1 1.3 Sales of crude oil 3.3 9.4 9.5 Midstream services 187.8 245.5 299.9 Total 191.5 256.0 310.7 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services: Sales of petrochemicals and refined products 5,470.9 6,000.6 4,009.1 Midstream services 738.0 781.8 720.6 Total 6,208.9 6,782.4 4,729.7 Total consolidated revenues $ 42,583.1 $ 44,313.0 $ 33,739.3 77 Table of Contents Selected Energy Commodity Price Data The following table presents index prices for natural gas, crude oil and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods presented: Polymer Refinery Natural Normal Natural Grade Grade Gas, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Gasoline, Propylene, Propylene, Crude Oil, $/MMBtu $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/pound $/pound $/barrel (1) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (3) (3) (4) 2010 Averages $ 4.39 $ 0.60 $ 1.16 $ 1.50 $ 1.58 $ 1.84 $ 0.61 $ 0.48 $ 79.53 2011 by quarter: 1st Quarter $ 4.11 $ 0.66 $ 1.37 $ 1.75 $ 1.85 $ 2.27 $ 0.76 $ 0.68 $ 94.10 2nd Quarter $ 4.32 $ 0.78 $ 1.49 $ 1.87 $ 2.02 $ 2.48 $ 0.89 $ 0.79 $ 102.56 3rd Quarter $ 4.20 $ 0.78 $ 1.54 $ 1.88 $ 2.09 $ 2.37 $ 0.78 $ 0.67 $ 89.76 4th Quarter $ 3.54 $ 0.86 $ 1.44 $ 1.89 $ 2.26 $ 2.24 $ 0.59 $ 0.44 $ 94.06 2011 Averages $ 4.04 $ 0.77 $ 1.46 $ 1.85 $ 2.06 $ 2.34 $ 0.76 $ 0.64 $ 95.12 2012 by quarter: 1st Quarter $ 2.72 $ 0.56 $ 1.26 $ 1.93 $ 2.04 $ 2.39 $ 0.69 $ 0.60 $ 102.93 2nd Quarter $ 2.21 $ 0.40 $ 0.98 $ 1.62 $ 1.75 $ 2.05 $ 0.66 $ 0.51 $ 93.49 3rd Quarter $ 2.80 $ 0.34 $ 0.89 $ 1.44 $ 1.62 $ 2.01 $ 0.51 $ 0.37 $ 92.22 4th Quarter $ 3.41 $ 0.28 $ 0.88 $ 1.64 $ 1.82 $ 2.15 $ 0.56 $ 0.48 $ 88.18 2012 Averages $ 2.79 $ 0.40 $ 1.00 $ 1.65 $ 1.81 $ 2.15 $ 0.60 $ 0.49 $ 94.20 (1) Natural gas prices are based on Henry-Hub I-FERC commercial index prices.

Period-to-period fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices. Energy commodity prices fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including supply and demand imbalances and geopolitical tensions. Energy commodity prices during 2012 were generally lower when compared to those in 2011. For example: § The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs (based on prices for such products at Mont Belvieu, Texas, which is the primary industry hub for domestic NGL production) was $1.12 per gallon during 2012 versus $1.46 per gallon during 2011 – a 23% year-to-year decrease. § The market price of natural gas (as measured at the Henry Hub in Louisiana) averaged $2.79 per MMBtu during 2012 versus $4.04 per MMBtu during 2011 – a 31% year-to-year decrease. § The market price of crude oil (as measured on the NYMEX) averaged $94.20 per barrel during 2012 compared to $95.12 per barrel during 2011 – a 1% year-to-year decrease. A decrease in our consolidated marketing revenues due to lower commodity energy sales prices may not generate a decrease in gross operating margin or cash available for distributions, since corresponding cost of sales amounts would also be lower due to comparable decreases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same correlation would be true in the case of higher energy commodity sales prices and purchase prices. We attempt to mitigate any commodity price exposure through our hedging activities as well as through converting keepwhole and similar contracts to fee-based arrangements. See Part II, Item 7A of this annual report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities. 78 Table of Contents Consolidated Income Statement Highlights The following information highlights significant changes in our year-to-year income statement amounts and the primary drivers of such changes. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Revenues for 2012 decreased $1.73 billion compared to 2011. NGL, natural gas and petrochemical and refined products marketing revenues for 2012 decreased $3.51 billion primarily due to lower energy commodity prices in 2012. This year-to-year decrease was partially offset by a $1.58 million year-to-year increase in crude oil sales revenues primarily due to higher sales volumes. Operating costs and expenses for 2012 decreased $1.95 billion when compared to 2011 primarily due to lower overall cost of sales. The cost of sales associated with our NGL, natural gas and petrochemical and refined products marketing activities decreased $3.64 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower energy commodity prices. This year-to-year decrease was partially offset by a $1.36 billion increase in the cost of sales associated with increased crude oil sales volumes. Depreciation, amortization and accretion in operating costs and expenses increased $103.0 million year-to-year primarily due to new assets that were under construction being placed into service. Gains attributable to the disposal of assets for 2012 decreased $138.4 million when compared to 2011. Results for 2011 included a $129.1 million gain we recorded in connection with the sale of our Petal and Hattiesburg, Mississippi natural gas storage facilities. Non-cash asset impairment charges for 2012 increased $35.6 million when compared to 2011 primarily due to the abandonment of certain pipeline and natural gas processing assets. For information regarding such charges, see ""Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements"" within Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. General and administrative costs for 2012 decreased $11.5 million when compared to 2011. The year ended December 31, 2011 included $12.0 million of transaction expenses related to the Duncan Merger. Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2012 increased $17.9 million when compared to 2011 primarily due to improved results from the Seaway Pipeline partially offset by a decrease in equity earnings from Energy Transfer Equity. Equity earnings from our investment in the Seaway Pipeline increased $36.7 million year-to-year due to the completion of its reversal project during the second quarter of 2012. Our equity in the earnings of Energy Transfer Equity was $2.4 million for 2012 compared to $14.8 million for 2011. We liquidated our remaining investment in Energy Transfer Equity common units in early 2012. Interest expense for 2012 increased $27.7 million when compared to 2011. On a weighted-average basis, the effective interest rates we paid on our consolidated debt during 2012 were essentially unchanged with respect to those paid during 2011. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to generally higher debt levels partially offset by higher capitalized interest. Our average debt principal balance for 2012 was $15.3 billion compared to $14.59 billion for 2011. Interest costs capitalized in connection with our capital spending program increased $10.1 million year-to-year. Other income for 2012 increased $72.9 million when compared to 2011 primarily due to the $68.8 million in gains we recorded in connection with the liquidation of our investment in Energy Transfer Equity, which was completed in April 2012. For additional information regarding these sales, see ""Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidation of Investment in Energy Transfer Equity"" within this Item 7. We recognized a net income tax benefit of $17.2 million for 2012 compared to a $27.2 million expense for income taxes in 2011. The $44.4 million year-to-year change in income taxes is primarily due to a $45.3 million benefit related to the conversion of certain of our subsidiaries to limited liability companies during 2012. Comparison of 2011 with 2010. Revenues for 2011 increased $10.57 billion when compared to 2010. NGL and petrochemical and refined products marketing revenues for 2011 increased $5.27 billion primarily due to 79 Table of Contents higher energy commodity prices in 2011. Crude oil marketing revenues for 2011 increased $5.25 billion attributable to higher sales volumes, which accounted for $3.53 billion of the year-to-year increase, and higher sales prices for the remaining increase. These year-to-year increases were partially offset by a $62.4 million year-to-year decrease in natural gas sales revenues primarily due to lower sales volumes. Operating costs and expenses for 2011 increased $9.57 billion when compared to 2010 primarily due to higher overall cost of sales. The cost of sales associated with our NGL and petrochemical and refined products marketing activities increased $4.80 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher energy commodity prices. The cost of sales associated with our crude oil marketing activities increased $5.01 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for $3.4 billion of the year-to-year increase, and higher prices for the remaining increase. These year-to-year increases were partially offset by a $239.3 million decrease in cost of sales associated with lower natural gas prices. Other operating costs and expenses for 2011 increased $369.5 million when compared to 2010. The primary drivers for this year-to-year increase are: (i) a $177.5 million increase attributable to both the timing of acquisitions during each year (e.g., the State Line and Fairplay acquisitions were acquired in May 2010 and therefore did not have a full year of results in 2010) and the placing into service of newly constructed assets (e.g., our Haynesville Extension pipeline commenced operations in November 2011); (ii) a $102.4 million increase attributable to higher maintenance and pipeline integrity expenses; and (iii) a $30.7 million increase in pipeline transmix expenses due to higher prices. Depreciation, amortization and accretion in operating costs and expenses increased $22.4 million year-to-year primarily due to new assets that were under construction being placed into service and depreciation and amortization attributable to assets acquired in connection with business combinations. Gains from asset sales and related transactions included in operating costs and expenses increased $111.6 million year-to-year primarily due to a $129.1 million gain we recorded in connection with the sale of our Petal and Hattiesburg, Mississippi natural gas storage facilities in December 2011. Non-cash asset impairment charges for 2011 increased $19.4 million when compared to 2010 primarily due to the abandonment of certain pipeline and storage assets. For information regarding such charges, see ""Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements"" within Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. General and administrative costs for 2011 decreased $23.0 million when compared to 2010. General and administrative costs include $12.0 million of transaction expenses in 2011 for the Duncan Merger and $24.5 million of transaction expenses in 2010 for the Holdings Merger. The remainder of the year-to-year decrease in general and administrative costs is primarily due to lower overall compensation costs. Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2011 decreased $15.6 million when compared to 2010 primarily due to lower volumes on the Seaway Pipeline, Centennial Pipeline and those pipelines operated by our investees in the Gulf of Mexico, all of which was partially offset by increased equity earnings from our investment in Energy Transfer Equity. Interest expense for 2011 increased $2.2 million when compared to 2010. On a weighted-average basis, the effective interest rates we paid on our consolidated debt during 2011 were essentially unchanged with respect to those charged during 2010. Although our average debt principal balances increased from $13.23 billion in 2010 to $14.59 billion in 2011, a substantial portion of the interest costs associated with the new borrowings were capitalized in connection with our capital spending program. Capitalized interest for 2011 increased $59.5 million when compared to 2010. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $41.4 million for 2011 compared to $1.06 billion for 2010, which included $1.0 billion attributable to the limited partners of Enterprise other than Holdings. As noted under ""Basis of Financial Statement Presentation"" within this Item 7, Enterprise's financial and operating results prior to November 22, 2010 have been presented as if Enterprise were Holdings from an accounting perspective (i.e., the financial statements of Holdings became the historical financial statements of Enterprise). For periods prior 80 Table of Contents to the Holdings Merger, that portion of Enterprise's net income attributable to its limited partner interests owned by third parties and related parties other than Holdings is presented as a component of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Business Segment Highlights Total segment gross operating margin was $4.39 billion for 2012 compared to $3.87 billion for 2011. Total segment gross operating margin for 2010 was $3.25 billion. The following information highlights significant changes in our year-to-year segment results (i.e., gross operating margin amounts) and the primary drivers of such changes. The selected volume statistics presented in the tabular information for each segment are reported on a net basis, taking into account our ownership interests in certain joint ventures, and reflect the periods in which we owned an interest in such operations. These statistics reflect volumes for newly constructed assets from the dates such assets were placed into service and for purchased assets from the date of acquisition. We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. For information regarding this financial metric, see ""Other Items – Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" within this Item 7. All activities included in our former sixth reportable business segment, Other Investments, ceased on January 18, 2012, which was the date we discontinued using the equity method to account for our previously held investment in Energy Transfer Equity. Our equity earnings from this investment were $2.4 million and $14.8 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively. We recorded a loss in equity earnings of $2.8 million from this investment in 2010. NGL Pipelines & Services. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Segment gross operating margin: Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities $ 1,443.0 $ 1,324.4 $ 989.9 NGL pipelines and related storage 740.7 638.4 604.8 NGL fractionation 284.8 221.4 137.9 Total $ 2,468.5 $ 2,184.2 $ 1,732.6 Selected volumetric data: NGL transportation volumes (MBPD) 2,472 2,284 2,322 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 659 575 485 Equity NGL production (MBPD) (1) 101 116 121 Fee-based natural gas processing (MMcf/d) (2) 4,382 3,820 2,932 (1) Represents the NGL volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities. In general, equity NGL production decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 due to reduced ethane recoveries associated with the weakness in natural gas processing margins resulting from lower NGL prices. (2) Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our gas plants. The increase in fee-based processing volumes in 2012 is primarily due to (i) the start-up of our Yoakum gas plant in May 2012 and (ii) changes in processing agreements whereby producers are electing to process more of their natural gas on a fee basis in order to retain NGLs extracted from their natural gas streams, which, in turn, also lowers our equity NGL production. 81 Table of Contents Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2012 increased $118.6 million when compared to 2011. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities for 2012 increased $150.4 million compared to 2011, of which we attribute a $94.2 million year-to-year increase to higher sales margins and the remainder attributed to higher sales volumes. Our South Texas natural gas processing plants posted a $57.2 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin primarily due to higher equity NGL and fee-based processing volumes from the start-up of our new Yoakum plant, which commenced operations in May 2012. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants located in the Rocky Mountains included a $20.0 million gain related to a vendor settlement recognized in 2012. In addition, gross operating margin from our Meeker natural gas processing plant increased $34.8 million year-to-year primarily due to the favorable impact of our commodity hedging activities on this facility's processing margins during 2012. Gross operating margin from our Pioneer and Chaco natural gas processing plants decreased $102.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower equity NGL production volumes. Lastly, gross operating margin from our Louisiana and East Texas natural gas processing plants decreased $32.6 million year-to-year, of which we attribute $25.4 million of the decrease to lower natural gas processing margins. Comparison of 2011 with 2010. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2011 increased $334.5 million when compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased $210.6 million year-to-year due to higher NGL sales margins. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants located in the Rocky Mountains increased $71.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher natural gas processing margins, which accounted for $32.4 million of the year-to-year increase, and higher equity NGL production and fee-based processing volumes in 2011. Collectively, gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants in southern Louisiana and the San Juan and Permian Basins increased $42.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher natural gas processing margins in 2011 compared to 2010. Natural gas processing activities on the Fairplay Gathering System, which we acquired in May 2010, accounted for $8.9 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin. NGL pipelines and related storage Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage business for 2012 increased $102.3 million when compared to 2011. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related NGL terminals increased $37.2 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in system-wide tariffs and other fees. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu NGL storage business increased $22.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher storage volumes. Gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel import/export terminal and a related pipeline increased $19.6 million year-to-year attributable to higher export volumes. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System, including the new Eagle Ford NGL Pipeline placed into service in April 2012, increased $45.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher NGL volumes associated with Eagle Ford Shale production. The foregoing year-to-year increases in gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage business were partially offset by $20.1 million of net operational measurement gains in 2011 that did not reoccur in 2012. Comparison of 2011 with 2010. Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage business for 2011 increased $33.6 million when compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related NGL terminals increased $53.0 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in revenues attributable to changes in the mix of transportation services provided to customers (e.g., increased long-haul delivery volumes and changes in delivery destinations) during 2011 compared to 2010 and an increase in system-wide tariffs in July 2011. Gross operating margin from our NGL storage activities increased $14.9 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in storage and terminaling fees charged at our NGL terminals in the northeastern U.S. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System increased $5.0 million year-to-year primarily due to a $6.8 million charge we recorded during 2010 related to a dispute involving a pipeline segment on this system. Collectively, gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines in southern Louisiana decreased $18.5 million year-to-year primarily due to a decrease in transportation volumes. The year-to-year decrease in NGL transportation volumes on our pipelines in southern Louisiana was primarily due to reduced supplies of NGLs in 82 Table of Contents 2011 compared to 2010 from offshore Gulf of Mexico production developments and reduced volumes of mixed NGLs transported from our Mont Belvieu facility to NGL fractionators in southern Louisiana. Gross operating margin from our Dixie Pipeline and related NGL terminals decreased $13.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower transportation volumes, which accounted for $10.2 million of the year-to-year decrease, and higher pipeline integrity expenses in 2011. Lastly, gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel import/export terminal and a related pipeline decreased $9.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating expenses in 2011. NGL fractionation Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2012 increased $63.4 million when compared to 2011 primarily due to higher fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex. We placed into service the fifth and sixth NGL fractionation unit at our Mont Belvieu complex during the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2012, respectively. Completion of these facilities increased total NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex by about 170 MBPD to a total of approximately 485 MBPD (433 MBPD net to our interest) at the end of 2012. Comparison of 2011 with 2010. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2011 increased $83.5 million when compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators increased $62.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher NGL fractionation volumes. We placed into service the fourth and fifth NGL fractionation unit at our Mont Belvieu complex during the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2011, respectively. Completion of these facilities increased total NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex by about 170 MBPD to a total of approximately 400 MBPD (348 MBPD net to our interest) at the end of 2011. Gross operating margin from our Norco NGL fractionator increased $17.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher NGL prices, which resulted in higher revenues associated with percent-of-liquids contracts and product blending activities during 2011 compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from our Hobbs NGL fractionator increased $8.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher NGL fractionation fees. Lastly, gross operating margin decreased $4.9 million year-to-year due to the sale of our Colorado NGL fractionators in March 2011. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Segment gross operating margin $ 775.5 $ 675.3 $ 527.2 Selected volumetric data: Natural gas transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 13,634 13,231 11,482 Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from onshore natural gas pipelines and services for 2012 increased $100.2 million when compared to 2011. Gross operating margin from our Acadian Gas System increased $142.5 million year-to-year primarily due to contributions from our Haynesville Extension pipeline. The Haynesville Extension of our Acadian Gas System commenced operations in November 2011 and transported 1.4 TBtus/d of natural gas during 2012. Gross operating margin from our Texas natural gas pipelines and related storage assets increased $86.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher firm capacity reservation revenues on the Texas Intrastate System. Increased natural gas production volumes from the Eagle Ford Shale supply basin resulted in stronger demand for our natural gas transportation services on the Texas Intrastate System during 2012. The foregoing year-to-year increases in gross operating margin from our natural gas pipelines were partially offset by several factors. Gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System decreased $31.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower gathering and related fees. Gathering fees on our San Juan system are impacted by changes in regional natural gas prices, which decreased on average 31% year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities decreased $24.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins. Gross operating margin from our Jonah Gathering System decreased $17.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower throughput volumes. Likewise, gross operating margin from our Central Treating facility in Colorado 83 Table of Contents decreased $9.8 million year-to-year due to lower volumes. Lastly, gross operating margin decreased $38.4 million year-to-year due to the sale of our Mississippi natural gas storage business in December 2011 and the sale of a natural gas gathering system in Alabama in August 2011. Comparison of 2011 with 2010. Gross operating margin from onshore natural gas pipelines and services for 2011 increased $148.1 million when compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System increased $63.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher firm capacity reservation revenues. Increased natural gas production volumes from the Eagle Ford Shale supply basin resulted in stronger demand for our natural gas transportation services during 2011 compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities increased $50.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales margins in 2011. Gross operating margin from our Acadian Gas System increased $29.3 million year-to-year primarily due to contributions from our Haynesville Extension pipeline. The Haynesville Extension of our Acadian Gas System commenced operations in November 2011 and transported 1.22 TBtus/d of natural gas during the fourth quarter of 2011. Our State Line and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems, which we acquired in May 2010, contributed $26.5 million of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin. Gross operating margin from our Piceance Basin Gathering System increased $6.7 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in transportation volumes. The foregoing year-to-year increases in gross operating margin from our natural gas pipelines were partially offset by several factors. Gross operating margin from our Jonah Gathering System decreased $14.4 million year-to-year primarily due to a decrease in transportation volumes. Lastly, gross operating margin decreased $14.3 million year-to-year due to the sale of our Mississippi natural gas storage business in December 2011. Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Segment gross operating margin $ 387.7 $ 234.0 $ 113.7 Selected volumetric data: Crude oil transportation volumes (MBPD) 828 678 670 Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from our onshore crude oil pipelines and services business for 2012 increased $153.7 million when compared to 2011. Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related activities increased $59.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales margins, which accounted for $35.5 million of the increase, and sales volumes, which accounted for the remaining increase. Our crude oil marketing activities continue to benefit from increased crude oil production volumes from supply basins in the Eagle Ford Shale, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountains regions. Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System increased $55.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes attributable to the Eagle Ford Expansion pipeline. Equity earnings from our investment in Seaway increased $36.7 million year-to-year primarily due to the Seaway Pipeline commencing the southbound delivery of crude oil during the second quarter of 2012. Comparison of 2011 with 2010. Gross operating margin from our onshore crude oil pipelines and services business for 2011 increased $120.3 million when compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related activities increased $96.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales margins, which accounted for $68.3 million of the increase, and sales volumes, which accounted for the remaining increase. Collectively, gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil System, West Texas System, Red River System and Basin Pipeline increased $34.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average fees during 2011, which accounted for $17.6 million of the increase, and a 46 MBPD increase in throughput volumes, which accounted for the remaining increase. Prior to completion of the Seaway reversal project during the second quarter of 2012, the Seaway pipeline was used to transport crude oil north from the Texas Gulf Coast to the Cushing Hub. Demand for northbound long- 84 Table of Contents haul transportation services on the Seaway Pipeline was significantly lower during 2011 due to an oversupply of crude oil at the Cushing hub. As a result, equity earnings from our investment in Seaway decreased $10.8 million year-to-year. Offshore Pipelines & Services. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Offshore Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Segment gross operating margin $ 173.0 $ 228.2 $ 297.8 Selected volumetric data: (1) Natural gas transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 853 1,065 1,242 Crude oil transportation volumes (MBPD) 300 279 320 Platform natural gas processing (MMcf/d) 291 405 513 Platform crude oil processing (MBPD) 17 17 17 (1) The Offshore Pipelines & Services segment continues to be adversely impacted by lower volumes attributable to the federal offshore drilling moratorium in 2010. In recent months, however, the rig count and drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico has reached pre-moratorium levels. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from our offshore pipelines and services business for 2012 decreased $55.2 million when compared to 2011. Collectively, gross operating margin from our Independence Hub platform and Independence Trail pipeline decreased $68.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower throughput volumes and platform demand fee revenues during 2012 versus 2011. Producers connected to our Independence Hub platform paid us $54.6 million of demand fees annually for five years beginning in March 2007 until that period expired in March 2012. Expiration of these contractual demand fees resulted in a $44.9 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin. Collectively, gross operating margin from our Anaconda Natural Gas Gathering System and Constitution and Poseidon Crude Oil Pipelines increased $22.4 million year-to-year primarily due to natural gas and crude oil production from the Caesar/Tonga development in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico that commenced in March 2012. This increase was partially offset by a collective $8.0 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin from our Viosca Knoll and HIOS natural gas systems primarily due to lower transportation volumes in 2012. Comparison of 2011 with 2010. Gross operating margin from our offshore pipelines and services business for 2011 decreased $69.6 million when compared to 2010. Results for 2010 included $27.5 million of gains related to insurance proceeds. Excluding gains from insurance proceeds, gross operating margin from this business decreased $42.1 million year-to-year primarily due to the effects of the federal offshore drilling moratorium (which was in effect from May 2010 to October 2010) and related actions that restricted the issuance of new drilling and well workover permits. These governmental actions reduced production volumes from Gulf of Mexico developments, which decreased the volumes we transport and handle with our offshore assets. Collectively, gross operating margin from our Independence Hub platform and Independence Trail pipeline decreased $22.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower throughput volumes attributable to depletion at existing production wells, the watering-out of certain wells and the impact of the federal offshore drilling moratorium which has slowed the drilling of replacement wells. Equity earnings from our investments in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline and Poseidon Oil Pipeline Systems decreased $16.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower throughput volumes in 2011 compared to 2010. Likewise, gross operating margin from our Shenzi and Constitution Oil Pipelines collectively decreased $4.9 million year-to-year due to lower volumes. Gross operating margin from our Anaconda Gathering System increased $6.8 million year-to-year primarily due to a system extension that was completed and placed into service during 2011. Excluding Independence Hub, gross operating margin from the remainder of our offshore platform services business decreased 85 Table of Contents $6.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher maintenance expenses at our facilities located in the Garden Banks area of the Gulf of Mexico. Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Petrochemical & Refined Products Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Segment gross operating margin: Propylene fractionation and related activities $ 193.1 $ 161.2 $ 212.4 Butane isomerization 95.8 124.9 84.9 Octane enhancement and related plant operations 100.9 109.1 47.0 Refined products pipelines and related activities 89.9 79.6 170.8 Marine transportation and other 100.2 60.4 69.4 Total $ 579.9 $ 535.2 $ 584.5 Selected volumetric data: Propylene fractionation volumes (MBPD) 72 73 77 Butane isomerization volumes (MBPD) 95 101 89 Octane additive and related plant production volumes (MBPD) 16 17 16 Transportation volumes, primarily refined products and petrochemicals (MBPD) 689 783 893 Propylene fractionation and related activities Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from our propylene fractionation and related petrochemical marketing activities for 2012 increased $31.9 million when compared to 2011 primarily due to higher propylene sales margins during the 2012 while production volumes remained fairly constant. Comparison of 2011 with 2010. Gross operating margin from propylene fractionation and related petrochemical marketing activities for 2011 decreased $51.2 million when compared to 2010. The year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is primarily due to lower propylene fractionation volumes and sales margins in 2011. Of the total decrease in gross operating margin, we attribute $17.6 million to lower propylene fractionation volumes. Results for 2010 benefited from the combined effects of high demand for propylene and reduced propylene production from third party petrochemical facilities. Butane isomerization Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization for 2012 decreased $29.1 million when compared to 2011. The year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is primarily due to lower isomerization production volumes (and corresponding by-product production and sales) and processing fees. Isomerization production volumes for 2012 were negatively impacted by extended downtime for maintenance at our octane enhancement facility (which utilizes high purity isobutane feedstock produced at our butane isomerization facility) during 2012. The decrease in by-product production and sales during 2012 accounted for $18.6 million of the $29.1 million year-to-year reduction in gross operating margin. Comparison of 2011 with 2010. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization for 2011 increased $40.0 million when compared to 2010. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is due to a $30.6 million increase in by-product production and sales margins and $9.4 million attributable to higher isomerization production volumes in 2011. Octane enhancement and related plant operations Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from octane enhancement and related high purity isobutylene plant (""HPIB"") operations for 2012 decreased a combined $8.2 million when compared to 2011. An estimated $27.1 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin attributable to higher product sales margins was more than offset by the combined effects of an estimated $19.5 million decrease due to lower sales volumes and 86 Table of Contents $15.8 million in higher operating expenses (e.g., catalyst and related costs) during 2012. Our octane enhancement facility experienced extended periods of downtime during 2012, which negatively impacted production and sales volumes and turnaround-related costs. Comparison of 2011 with 2010. Gross operating margin from octane enhancement and HPIB operations for 2011 increased $62.1 million when compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement facility for 2011 increased $54.7 million compared to 2010 primarily due to higher motor gasoline additive sales margins, which accounted for $30.6 million of the increase, and volumes, which accounted for $15.9 million of the increase. The remainder of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin from this facility was attributable to lower operating expenses (primarily repair and maintenance costs) in 2011. The remainder of the year-to-year increase is attributable to the addition of gross operating margin from the HPIB assets we acquired in November 2010. Refined products pipelines and related activities Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2012 increased $10.3 million when compared to 2011. Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline and related Centennial pipeline increased $4.9 million year-to-year primarily due to a $44.1 million decrease in operating costs and expenses. Our TE Products Pipeline incurred $31.2 million of costs in 2011 related to the repair of pipeline leaks in New York State, Texas and Louisiana. The remainder of the year-to-year decrease in operating costs and expenses is primarily due to lower expenses in 2012 for operating gains and losses and costs related to transmix (i.e., the comingling of two purity products in a pipeline). Revenues earned by our TE Products Pipeline from the transportation of refined products and NGLs decreased $36.5 million year-to-year primarily due to a 26 MBPD decrease in NGL volumes delivered to Northeast U.S. markets and a 44 MBPD decrease in refined products volumes delivered to Midwest U.S. markets. In general, warmer weather during 2012 compared to 2011 resulted in lower demand for propane used as heating fuel, while shipments of refined products from the Gulf Coast to Midwest markets decreased as a result of lower prices for such products in Midwestern markets than in Gulf Coast markets. Structural shifts in population, reduced demand and increased refinery production in the Midwest have contributed to a decline in demand for the transportation of refined products from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest. Gross operating margin from the marketing of refined products increased $4.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales margins during 2012. Comparison of 2011 with 2010. Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2011 decreased $91.2 million when compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline and related Centennial pipeline decreased $79.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower throughput volumes attributable to the structural shifts, reduced demand and increased refinery production in the Midwest noted above. In addition, results for the TE Products Pipeline include a $22.8 million year-to-year increase in costs related to the repair of pipeline leaks in New York State, Texas and Louisiana. Gross operating margin from the marketing of refined products decreased $12.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins during 2011 associated with forward sales contracts. Marine transportation and other Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other segment services for 2012 increased $39.8 million when compared to 2011. Results for 2012 include a $24.0 million gain recorded in connection with a legal settlement. The remainder of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to the combination of $10.4 million in higher marine transportation fees and a $4.7 million decrease in operating expenses associated with our fleet of marine vessels during 2012. Comparison of 2011 with 2010. Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other segment services for 2011 decreased $9.0 million when compared to 2010. Gross operating margin from marine transportation decreased $14.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower revenues resulting from the sale of marine transportation vessels in February 2011 that comprised our former bunker fuel transportation fleet. Gross operating margin from other services increased $5.4 million year-to-year primarily due to our acquisition of truck transport operations from EPCO in September 2010. 87 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2012, we had $3.17 billion of consolidated liquidity, which is defined as unrestricted cash on hand plus borrowing capacity available under EPO's $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs. We expect to issue additional equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future liquidity and capital spending requirements. We have a universal shelf registration statement (the ""2010 Shelf"") on file with the SEC. The 2010 Shelf allows Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and EPO (on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. The 2010 Shelf will expire in July 2013, at which time we expect to file a replacement universal shelf registration statement. Consolidated Debt We had $16.18 billion of principal amounts outstanding under consolidated debt agreements at December 31, 2012. The following table presents contractually scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2012 for the next five years, and in total thereafter (dollars in millions): Scheduled Maturities of Debt Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 After 2017 Commercial Paper Notes $ 346.6 $ 346.6 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- Senior Notes 14,300.0 1,200.0 1,150.0 1,300.0 750.0 800.0 9,100.0 Junior Subordinated Notes 1,532.7 -- -- -- -- -- 1,532.7 Total $ 16,179.3 $ 1,546.6 $ 1,150.0 $ 1,300.0 $ 750.0 $ 800.0 $ 10,632.7 We expect to refinance the current maturities of our consolidated debt obligations at or prior to their maturity. Commercial Paper Notes. In August 2012, EPO established a commercial paper program under which it may issue (and have outstanding at any time) up to $2.0 billion in the aggregate of short-term commercial paper notes. As of December 31, 2012, a total of $346.6 million of notes were outstanding under this program. These notes matured in January 2013. The fixed interest rates for these notes ranged from 0.30% to 0.50%. Proceeds generated from the issuance of our commercial paper notes are used for general company purposes. We intend to maintain a minimum available borrowing capacity under EPO's existing $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility equal to any amount outstanding under commercial paper notes as a back-stop to the program. All commercial paper notes issued under the program are senior unsecured obligations of EPO that are unconditionally guaranteed by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Senior Notes. In February 2012, EPO issued $750.0 million in principal amount of 30-year unsecured Senior Notes EE at 99.542% of their principal amount. Senior Notes EE have a fixed interest rate of 4.85% and mature on August 15, 2042. Net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes EE were used to repay amounts due upon the maturity of $490.5 million principal amount of EPO Senior Notes S due February 2012 and $9.5 million principal amount of TEPPCO Senior Notes due February 2012 and for general company purposes. In August 2012, EPO issued $650.0 million in principal amount of 3-year unsecured Senior Notes FF at 99.941% of their principal amount and $1.1 billion in principal amount of 30-year unsecured Senior Notes GG at 99.470% of their principal amount. Senior Notes FF have a fixed interest rate of 1.25% and mature on August 13, 2015, and Senior Notes GG have a fixed interest rate of 4.45% and mature on February 15, 2043. Net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes FF and GG were used to temporarily reduce borrowings under EPO's $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and for general company purposes. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has unconditionally guaranteed Senior Notes EE, FF and GG on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis. These senior notes rank equal with EPO's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and are senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of EPO. These 88 Table of Contents senior notes are subject to make-whole redemption rights and were issued under indentures containing certain covenants, which generally restrict EPO's ability (with certain exceptions) to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. EPO utilized the 2010 Shelf to issue its Senior Notes EE in February 2012 and Senior Notes FF and GG in August 2012. For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Issuance of Common Units The following table summarizes the issuance of Enterprise common units during the years indicated in connection with its underwritten equity offerings, ""at-the-market"" program, and quarterly DRIP and employee unit purchase plan (""EUPP"") (dollars in millions, number of units issued as shown): Number of Common Units Issued Net Proceeds Received Year Ended December 31, 2010: (1) Common units issued in connection with underwritten offerings 37,950,000 $ 1,346.7 Common units issued in connection with the DRIP and EUPP 8,378,053 273.8 Total 46,328,053 $ 1,620.5 Year Ended December 31, 2011: Common units issued in connection with underwritten offerings 10,350,000 $ 448.5 Common units issued in connection with the DRIP and EUPP 2,337,904 94.4 Total 12,687,904 $ 542.9 Year Ended December 31, 2012: Common units issued in connection with underwritten offerings 9,200,000 $ 473.3 Common units issued in connection with the at-the-market program (2) 3,978,545 203.8 Common units issued in connection with the DRIP and EUPP 2,814,660 139.7 Total 15,993,205 $ 816.8 (1) Of the 46,328,053 common units issued during 2010, 33,103,053 were issued prior to the Holdings Merger. As a result, net cash proceeds from these pre-Holdings Merger common unit issuances are a component of cash contributions from noncontrolling interests as presented on our Statements of Cash Flows. Net cash proceeds from these pre-Holdings Merger issuances were approximately $1.1 billion. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the basis of presentation of our consolidated financial statements for 2010 in connection with the Holdings Merger. (2) The sale of common units under the at-the-market program was initiated during the third quarter of 2012. In September 2012, we utilized the 2010 Shelf to issue 9,200,000 common units (including an over-allotment of 1,200,000 common units) to the public at an offering price of $53.07 per unit, which generated total net cash proceeds of $473.3 million. In May 2012, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with certain broker-dealers pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to $1.0 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings. Pursuant to this ""at-the-market"" program, we may sell common units under the agreement from time to time by means of ordinary brokers' transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement. A registration statement covering the issuance and sale of common units pursuant to this agreement was filed with the SEC in March 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we issued 3,978,545 common units under this program for an aggregate price of $205.4 million, resulting in total net cash proceeds of $203.8 million. Proceeds from these sales were used for general company purposes, including funding capital expenditures. In January 2013, affiliates of privately-held EPCO, which own our general partner and approximately 37.2% of our limited partner interests, expressed their willingness to purchase at least $100 million of our common units from us during 2013 principally through our DRIP. The investment amount for each of the first, second, third 89 Table of Contents and fourth quarters of 2013 is expected to be at least $25 million per quarter. The first reinvestment of approximately $25 million occurred in connection with our February 2013 distribution payment. Using the 2010 Shelf, we issued 9,200,000 common units (including an over-allotment of 1,200,000 common units) in February 2013 to the public at an offering price of $54.56 per unit. This equity offering generated net cash proceeds of $486.6 million, which were used for general company purposes. For additional information regarding our registration statements, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this annual report. Credit Ratings As of March 1, 2013, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO's long-term senior unsecured debt securities were: BBB+ from Standard and Poor's; Baa2 from Moody's; and BBB from Fitch Ratings, and the credit ratings of EPO's short-term senior unsecured debt securities were: A-2 from Standard and Poor's, P-2 from Moody's and F-2 from Fitch Ratings. EPO's credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. The ratings from Fitch Ratings were not solicited. Designated Units Issued in Connection with Holdings Merger In connection with the Holdings Merger, a privately held affiliate of EPCO agreed to temporarily waive the regular quarterly cash distributions it would otherwise receive from us with respect to a certain number of our common units it owns (the ""Designated Units""). The temporary distribution waiver remains in effect for five years following the closing date of the Holdings Merger, which was completed in November 2010. Distributions paid to partners during calendar years 2011 and 2012 excluded 30,610,600 and 26,130,000 Designated Units, respectively. For the remaining term of the waiver agreement, the number of Designated Units outstanding is as follows for distributions paid or to be paid, if any, during the following calendar years: 23,700,000 during 2013; 22,560,000 during 2014; and 17,690,000 during 2015. The number of our distribution-bearing units will increase as the number of Designated Units decreases. For example, the number of our distribution-bearing units increased by 2,430,000 beginning with the February 2013 distribution and will increase in subsequent years as the number of Designated Units declines as scheduled in the waiver agreement. Conversion of Class B Units to Common Units Expected in 2013 In connection with the merger of TEPPCO Partners, L.P. with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries in October 2009 (the ""TEPPCO Merger""), a privately held affiliate of EPCO exchanged a portion of its TEPPCO units (based on a 1.24 exchange ratio) for 4,520,431 of our Class B units in lieu of receiving common units. The Class B units will automatically convert into the same number of common units on the date immediately following the payment date for the sixteenth regular quarterly distribution following the closing date of the TEPPCO Merger. We expect this conversion will occur during the third quarter of 2013. Until the conversion occurs, the Class B units are not entitled to receive regular quarterly cash distributions; however, the Class B units are entitled to vote together with the common units as a single class on partnership matters and, except for the payment of distributions prior to conversion, have the same rights and privileges as our common units. Liquidation of Investment in Energy Transfer Equity At December 31, 2011, we owned 29,303,514 common units of Energy Transfer Equity. On January 18, 2012, we sold 22,762,636 of these common units in a private transaction, which generated cash proceeds of $825.1 million. As a result of the January 18 transaction, our ownership interest in Energy Transfer Equity was reduced below 3%, and we discontinued using the equity method to account for this investment and began accounting for it as an investment in available-for-sale equity securities. The remaining 6,540,878 units were sold systematically through April 27, 2012 and generated additional total cash proceeds of $270.2 million. In the aggregate, the 90 Table of Contents liquidation of this investment during 2012 resulted in $68.8 million of gains that are presented as a component of other income. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (dollars in millions). For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 2,890.9 $ 3,330.5 $ 2,300.0 Cash used in investing activities 3,018.8 2,777.6 3,251.6 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 124.2 (598.6 ) 961.1 Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. As a result, these cash flows are exposed to certain risks. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry. We provide products and services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemicals. The products that we process, sell, transport or store are principally used as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating; as feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing; and in the production of motor gasoline. Reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers, whether because of a decline in general economic conditions, reduced demand for the end products made with our products, or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons, could have a negative impact on our earnings and operating cash flows. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts: Comparison of 2012 with 2011 Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $439.6 million year-to-year. A $442.5 million year-to-year increase in cash attributable to overall higher partnership income (after adjusting our $339.7 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows) was more than offset by a $363.6 million year-to-year increase in cash used for inventories and a $407.3 million year-to-year decrease in cash flow generally attributable to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to operations. In addition, distributions from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $39.7 million year-to-year primarily due to an $80.6 million decrease in cash distributions from Energy Transfer Equity partially offset by a $39.7 million increase in distributions from Seaway. For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see ""Results of Operations"" within this Item 7. We liquidated our remaining investment in Energy Transfer Equity in April 2012. Investing Activities. The $241.2 million year-to-year increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to increased investments in unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by reduced capital expenditures and higher proceeds from asset sales. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates increased $579.5 million year-to-year primarily due to capital expenditures incurred in connection with modifications to and expansion of the Seaway Pipeline, construction of the Texas Express Pipeline, and those involving the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline. Capital spending for consolidated property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs, decreased $244.1 million year-to-year. Proceeds from the disposal of assets increased $145.0 million year-to-year primarily due to the liquidation of our remaining investment in Energy Transfer Equity in 2012. 91 Table of Contents Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $124.2 million during 2012 compared to cash used in financing activities of $598.6 million during 2011. The $722.8 million change in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to the following: § Net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements increased $738.4 million year-to-year. EPO issued $2.5 billion and repaid $1.0 billion in principal amount of senior notes during 2012, compared to the issuance of $2.75 billion and repayment of $450.0 million in principal amount of senior notes during 2011. In addition, net repayments under our consolidated revolving bank credit facilities and term loans decreased $1.14 billion year-to-year. For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. § Cash outflows related to the monetization of interest rate derivative instruments increased $124.6 million year-to-year. During 2012, we settled a number of forward starting swaps and fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps resulting in a combined net cash outflow of $147.8 million in connection with the issuance of senior notes. Likewise in 2011, we settled a number of forward starting swaps and treasury locks resulting in a net cash outflow of $23.2 million in connection with the issuance of senior notes. For information regarding our interest rate hedging activities, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. § Cash distributions paid to limited partners increased $204.3 million year-to-year primarily due to a higher number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the associated quarterly distribution rates. § Net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units increased $273.9 million year-to-year. In total, we issued an aggregate 15,993,205 common units during 2012 in connection with underwritten offerings and our DRIP, EUPP and at-the-market program. This compares to 12,687,904 common units we issued during 2011 in connection with underwritten offerings and our DRIP and EUPP. For additional information regarding our consolidated partners equity amounts, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Comparison of 2011 with 2010 Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.03 billion year-to-year primarily due a $609.4 million year-to-year increase in cash attributable to overall higher partnership income (after adjusting our $704.6 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows) and a $573.3 million year-to-year decrease in cash used for inventories. Cash flow generally attributable to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements decreased $116.0 million year-to-year. Investing Activities. The $474.0 million year-to-year decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following: § Cash used for business combinations decreased $1.31 billion year-to-year, primarily due to the acquisition of the State Line and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems for approximately $1.2 billion in May 2010. § Proceeds from the disposal of assets increased $947.9 million year-to-year primarily due to the sale of a portion of our investment in Energy Transfer Equity for $375.2 million and the sale of certain natural gas storage facilities for $547.8 million during 2011. § Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs, increased $1.84 billion year-to-year primarily due to our Eagle Ford Shale and Haynesville Shale growth capital projects. Financing Activities. As noted under ""Basis of Financial Statement Presentation"" within this Item 7, the financial statements of Enterprise prior to the Holdings Merger were those of Holdings. As presented on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows, cash distributions paid to partners during 2010 represent payments to the 92 Table of Contents former unitholders of Holdings whereas cash distributions paid to partners during 2011 represent payments to the unitholders of Enterprise. Also, cash distributions paid to noncontrolling interests by Holdings during 2010 primarily represent cash distributions paid to the unitholders of Enterprise (other than Holdings). Cash contributions from noncontrolling interests during 2010 primarily represent proceeds from Enterprise's equity offerings (other than purchases by Holdings). Cash used in financing activities was $598.6 million during 2011 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $961.1 million during 2010. The $1.56 billion decrease in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to the following: § Net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements decreased $191.7 million year-to-year. EPO issued $2.75 billion of new senior notes and repaid $450.0 million in senior notes during 2011 compared to the issuance of $2.0 billion in senior notes and repayment of $500.0 million in senior notes and $54.0 million of other long-term debt during 2010. In addition, net repayments under consolidated revolving credit facilities and term loans increased approximately $988.3 million year-to-year. § Cash distributions to partners and noncontrolling interests were a combined $2.04 billion during 2011 compared to $1.78 billion during 2010. The increase in cash distributions is primarily due to increases in the number of Enterprise's distribution-bearing common units outstanding (including common units issued in connection with the Holdings Merger and Duncan Merger) and in its quarterly distribution rates. § On a combined basis, cash contributions from noncontrolling interests and net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units decreased $1.07 billion year-to-year. Substantially all of the cash contributions from noncontrolling interests during 2010 relate to net cash proceeds generated from the issuance of common units by Enterprise prior to the completion of the Holdings Merger. In total, Enterprise issued 12,687,904 common units and 46,328,053 common units during 2011 and 2010, respectively, in connection with underwritten offerings and its DRIP and EUPP. Capital Spending An important part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are positioned to continue to expand our system of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production resulting from development activities in the Rocky Mountains, Midcontinent, Northeast and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, including the Niobrara, Barnett, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Marcellus and Utica Shale plays and deepwater Gulf of Mexico producing regions. Although our current focus is on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. In past years, major oil and gas companies have sold non-strategic assets in the midstream energy sector in which we operate. We believe this trend will continue and we expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestitures. See ""Significant Recent Developments"" within this Item 7 for information regarding our current and proposed major capital projects, including construction of our ATEX Express long-haul ethane pipeline, world-scale PDH facility, SEKCO Oil Pipeline, the expansion of the Seaway Pipeline and multiple projects in the Eagle Ford Shale. 93 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our capital spending for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net: (1) Growth capital projects (2) $ 3,232.7 $ 3,552.3 $ 1,766.2 Sustaining capital projects (3) 365.8 290.3 235.9 Capital spending for business combinations -- -- 1,313.9 Investments in unconsolidated affiliates 609.5 30.0 8.0 Other investing activities 43.1 22.4 -- Total capital spending $ 4,251.1 $ 3,895.0 $ 3,324.0 (1) On certain of our capital projects, third parties are obligated to reimburse us for all or a portion of project expenditures. The majority of such arrangements are associated with projects related to pipeline construction and production well tie-ins. Contributions in aid of construction costs were $23.4 million, $24.9 million and $38.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table are presented net of related contributions in aid of construction costs. (2) Growth capital projects either result in additional revenue streams from existing assets or expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to and major renewals of existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we spent $3.8 billion on growth capital projects, of which $1.5 billion was for Eagle Ford Shale projects and $644 million was for Mont Belvieu projects. Based on information currently available, we estimate our consolidated capital spending for 2013 will approximate $4.4 billion, which includes estimated expenditures of $4.0 billion for growth capital projects and $350 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Of our total expected growth capital spending for 2013, approximately 60% relates to projects involving our interstate NGL and crude oil pipelines, including construction of our ATEX Express ethane pipeline, expansion of the Rocky Mountain segment of our Mid-America Pipeline System, our share of the costs to construct the Texas Express and Front Range NGL pipelines, and our share of the costs to modify and expand the Seaway Pipeline. In addition, 10% of our total expected growth capital spending for 2013 relates to Eagle Ford Shale projects (e.g., completion of our Yoakum natural gas processing plant and expansions of our NGL and crude oil pipeline assets that serve this important supply basin) and another 10% involves the expansion of our NGL fractionation complex at Mont Belvieu. The remainder of our growth capital spending for 2013 involves a variety of projects that we expect will either result in additional revenue streams from existing assets or expand our asset base through the construction of new assets that will generate additional revenue streams. Our forecast of consolidated capital expenditures for 2013 is based on our announced strategic operating and growth plans, which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, issuance of additional debt and equity securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital spending due to factors beyond our control, such as weather related issues, changes in supplier prices or adverse economic conditions. Furthermore, our forecast of capital spending may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include the addition of costs associated with unforeseen acquisition opportunities. Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a principal factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we currently intend to make the forecast capital expenditures noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital markets. At December 31, 2012, we had approximately $1.75 billion in purchase commitments outstanding that relate to our capital spending for property, plant and equipment. These commitments primarily relate to construction projects in Texas, including those in the Eagle Ford Shale and at our Mont Belvieu facility. 94 Table of Contents Pipeline Integrity Costs Our pipelines are subject to safety programs administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation (""DOT""). This federal agency has issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines (e.g., NGL, crude oil, refined products and petrochemical pipelines) and natural gas pipelines. In general, these regulations require companies to assess the condition of their pipelines in certain high consequence areas (as defined by the regulation) and to perform any necessary repairs. The following table summarizes our pipeline integrity costs, including those attributable to DOT regulations, for the periods presented (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Expensed $ 67.2 $ 64.7 $ 39.4 Capitalized 79.4 52.6 40.4 Total $ 146.6 $ 117.3 $ 79.8 We expect the cost of our pipeline integrity program, irrespective of whether such costs are capitalized or expensed, to approximate $118.0 million in 2013. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following describes the estimation risk currently underlying our most significant financial statement items: Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset's cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Our estimate of depreciation expense incorporates management assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected salvage values, or (iv) significant changes in the forecast life of proved reserves of applicable resource basins, if any. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $24.85 billion and $22.19 billion, respectively. We recorded $900.5 million, $776.6 million and $745.7 million in depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil or refined products. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated salvage values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an 95 Table of Contents impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset's estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes. An equity method investment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible permanent loss in value of the investment (i.e., other than a temporary decline). Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee's industry. The carrying value of an equity method investment is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of discounted estimated cash flows expected to be derived from the investment. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment's underlying assets. A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges of $63.4 million, $27.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. We did not record any non-cash impairment charges related to our equity method investments in 2012, 2011 or 2010. Amortization Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Qualifying Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential identifiable intangible assets include items such as intellectual property, customer contracts and relationships, and non-compete agreements. The method used to value each intangible asset will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value we assigned to information about customers and the ability to have regular contact with them as a result of business combinations and assets purchases. These relationships may arise from formal contractual arrangements or through routine contact by sales or service representatives. The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits of the associated oil and natural gas resource basins from which the customers produce are estimated to be depleted. Our estimate of the useful life of each resource basin is predicated on a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. Our contract-based intangible assets represent rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement and the Jonah natural gas transportation contracts. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated useful life (or term), which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of useful life are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a fractionation facility, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights, and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such agreements. If our assumptions regarding the estimated useful life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset's unamortized cost is not recoverable due to impairment, we would be required to reduce the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. 96 Table of Contents At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was $1.57 billion and $1.66 billion, respectively. We recorded $125.7 million, $147.0 million and $137.6 million in amortization expense associated with our intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is subject to annual impairment testing at the end of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is probable that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Goodwill impairment testing involves determining the fair value of the associated reporting unit. These fair value amounts are based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the businesses that make up the reporting unit. Such assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the businesses contained within the reporting unit, which rely on management's estimates of operating margins, throughput volumes and similar factors; (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of a reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a charge to operating costs and expenses is required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its implied fair value. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value (i.e., by at least 10%). At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying value of our goodwill was $2.09 billion. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2012, 2011 or 2010. For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Revenue Recognition Policies and Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses In general, we recognize revenue from customers when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the buyer's price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. We record revenue when sales contracts are settled (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed). For additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. We record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts as required by our established policy. Our use of estimates for certain revenues and expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of our use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for a specific period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. If the assumptions underlying our revenue and expense estimates prove to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. We review our estimates based on currently available information. Recent Accounting Developments In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued an accounting standard update enhancing the disclosure of financial instruments and derivative instruments that have been offset on the 97 Table of Contents balance sheet or are subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement, regardless of whether they offset on the balance sheet. The objective of this enhanced disclosure is to facilitate the comparison of balance sheets between entities that prepare their financial statements using GAAP versus those entities that use International Financial Reporting Standards. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2013 and will apply its requirements beginning with quarterly report on Form 10-Q for March 31, 2013. The adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard update enhancing the disclosures of comprehensive income to improve the transparency of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings. We adopted this guidance upon issuance and will apply its requirements beginning with our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ending March 31, 2013. The adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Other Items Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. Our non-GAAP financial measure of total segment gross operating margin should not be considered an alternative to GAAP operating income. Our non-GAAP gross operating margin by business segment and in total is as follows for the periods presented (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 NGL Pipelines & Services $ 2,468.5 $ 2,184.2 $ 1,732.6 Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 775.5 675.3 527.2 Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services 387.7 234.0 113.7 Offshore Pipeline & Services 173.0 228.2 297.8 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services 579.9 535.2 584.5 Other Investments (1) 2.4 14.8 (2.8 ) Total segment gross operating margin $ 4,387.0 $ 3,871.7 $ 3,253.0 (1) Represents the equity earnings we recorded from our previously held investment in Energy Transfer Equity. Our reporting for this segment ceased on January 18, 2012 when we stopped using the equity method to account for this investment. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding the liquidation of our investment in Energy Transfer Equity. The following table presents a reconciliation of total segment gross operating margin to GAAP operating income and further to income before income taxes for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Total segment gross operating margin $ 4,387.0 $ 3,871.7 $ 3,253.0 Adjustments to reconcile total segment gross operating margin to operating income: Amounts included in operating costs and expenses: Depreciation, amortization and accretion (1,061.7 ) (958.7 ) (936.3 ) Non-cash asset impairment charges (63.4 ) (27.8 ) (8.4 ) Operating lease expenses paid by EPCO -- (0.3 ) (0.7 ) Gains attributable to disposal of assets 17.6 156.0 44.4 General and administrative costs (170.3 ) (181.8 ) (204.8 ) Operating income 3,109.2 2,859.1 2,147.2 Other expense, net (698.4 ) (743.6 ) (737.4 ) Income before income taxes $ 2,410.8 $ 2,115.5 $ 1,409.8 98 Table of Contents For additional information regarding gross operating margin, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2012 (dollars in millions): Payment or Settlement due by Period Less than 1-3 4-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1) $ 16,179.3 $ 1,546.6 $ 2,450.0 $ 1,550.0 $ 10,632.7 Estimated cash payments for interest (2) $ 17,072.7 $ 840.4 $ 1,471.4 $ 1,350.4 $ 13,410.5 Operating lease obligations (3) $ 363.0 $ 51.3 $ 86.9 $ 70.8 $ 154.0 Purchase obligations: (4) Product purchase commitments: Estimated payment obligations: Natural gas $ 4,027.2 $ 911.8 $ 1,400.6 $ 952.9 $ 761.9 NGLs $ 1,704.8 $ 1,136.3 $ 568.5 $ -- $ -- Crude oil $ 386.1 $ 386.1 $ -- $ -- $ -- Petrochemicals and refined products $ 2,121.8 $ 1,519.7 $ 485.1 $ 117.0 $ -- Other $ 127.7 $ 83.9 $ 14.8 $ 13.2 $ 15.8 Underlying major volume commitments: Natural gas (in TBtus) 1,442 321 497 348 276 NGLs (in MMBbls) 44 27 17 -- -- Crude oil (in MMBbls) 5 5 -- -- -- Petrochemicals and refined products (in MMBbls) 29 20 7 2 -- Service payment commitments (5) $ 745.5 $ 114.5 $ 195.9 $ 178.0 $ 257.1 Capital expenditure commitments (6) $ 1,754.0 $ 1,754.0 $ -- $ -- $ -- Other long-term liabilities (7) $ 205.0 $ -- $ 39.3 $ 13.2 $ 152.5 Total $ 44,687.1 $ 8,344.6 $ 6,712.5 $ 4,245.5 $ 25,384.5 (1) Represents contractually scheduled future maturities of our consolidated debt principal obligations. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2012, the scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable fixed or variable interest rates paid during 2012. With respect to our variable-rate debt obligations, we applied the weighted-average interest rate paid during 2012 to determine the estimated cash payments. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for the weighted-average variable interest rate charged in 2012 under our revolving credit facility. In addition, our estimate of cash payments for interest gives effect to interest rate swap agreements that were in place at December 31, 2012. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding these derivative instruments. Our estimated cash payments for interest are significantly influenced by the long-term maturities of our junior subordinated notes (due August 2066 through January 2068). Our estimated cash payments for interest with respect to each junior subordinated note are based on the current fixed interest rate for each note applied to the entire remaining term through the respective maturity date. (3) Primarily represents leases of underground salt dome caverns for the storage of natural gas and NGLs, office space with affiliates of EPCO and land held pursuant to right-of-way agreements. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services as of December 31, 2012. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2012 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Primarily represents our unconditional payment obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts. (6) Represents unconditional payment obligations for services to be rendered or products to be delivered in connection with our capital spending program, including our share of the capital spending of our unconsolidated affiliates. (7) As reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012, other long-term liabilities primarily represent the noncurrent portion of asset retirement obligations, deferred revenues and accrued obligations for pipeline transportation deficiency fees and interest rate derivative instruments. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 99 Table of Contents Off-Balance Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Related Party Transactions For information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Regulation For information regarding the impact of federal, state or local regulatory measures on our business, see ""Regulation"" under Part I, Item 1 and 2 of this annual report. Insurance Matters We participate as a named insured in EPCO's insurance program, which provides us with property damage, business interruption and other insurance coverage, the scope and amounts of which we believe are customary and prudent for the nature and extent of our operations. While we believe EPCO maintains adequate insurance coverage on our behalf, insurance may not fully cover every type of damage, interruption or other loss that might occur. If we were to incur a significant loss for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there may be timing differences between amounts we accrue related to property damage expense, amounts we are required to pay in connection with a loss and amounts we subsequently receive from insurance carriers as reimbursements. Any event that materially interrupts the revenues generated by our consolidated operations, or other losses that require us to make material expenditures not reimbursed by insurance, could reduce our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders and, accordingly, adversely affect the market price of our common units. Involuntary conversions result from the loss of an asset because of some unforeseen event (e.g., destruction due to fire). Some of these events are insurable, thus resulting in a property damage insurance recovery. Amounts we receive from insurance carriers are net of any deductibles related to the covered event. EPCO renewed its annual insurance programs during the second quarter of 2012. Under terms of the renewed policies, EPCO's deductibles now range from $5.0 million to $60.0 million depending on the nature of the loss (windstorm or non-windstorm) and the assets involved (onshore or offshore). We received $30.0 million and $20.0 million of nonrefundable insurance proceeds during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, attributable to property damage claims we filed in connection with a February 2011 NGL release and fire at the West Storage location of our Mont Belvieu, Texas underground storage facility. We remain in negotiation with our insurance carriers regarding the overall claim, which is currently projected to be up to $150.0 million. Operating income includes $30.0 million and $4.7 million of gains related to these insurance recoveries during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. To the extent that additional non-refundable insurance proceeds related to this incident are received, we expect to record gains equal to such proceeds. For additional information regarding insurance matters, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 100 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps, options and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding and the discount rates used to determine the present values. The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming: § the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk; § the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and § the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period. We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. If changes in market conditions or exposures warrant, the nature and volume of derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposures being managed. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. Interest Rate Hedging Activities We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain consolidated debt agreements. This strategy is a component in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. The composition of our derivative instrument portfolios may change from period-to-period depending on our hedging requirements. As presented in the tabular data below, each portfolio's estimated fair value at a given date is based on a number of factors, including the number and types of derivatives outstanding at that date, the notional value of the swaps and associated interest rates. Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps exchange the stated interest rate paid on a notional amount of existing debt for the fixed or floating interest rate stipulated in the derivative instrument.

Forward-starting interest rate swaps Forward starting swaps perform a similar function as traditional interest rate swaps except that they are associated with interest rates underlying anticipated future issuances of debt. The following table summarizes our portfolio of forward starting swaps at December 31, 2012 (dollars in millions): Hedged Transaction Number and Type of Derivatives Outstanding Notional Amount Expected Termination Date Average Rate Locked Accounting Treatment Future debt offering 16 forward starting swaps $ 1,000.0 3/2013 3.7 % Cash flow hedge The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our forward starting swap portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Forward Starting Swap Portfolio Aggregate Fair Value at Resulting Classification December 31, December 31, January 31, Scenario 2011 2012 2013 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Liability $ (290.7 ) $ (175.4 ) $ (153.9 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Liability (251.8 ) (157.5 ) (134.2 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Liability (330.6 ) (193.7 ) (173.9 ) The decrease in fair value of our forward starting swap portfolio since December 31, 2011 is primarily due to the settlement, in connection with the issuance of senior notes, of 17 forward starting swaps having an aggregate notional value of $850.0 million, resulting in cash losses totaling $185.5 million. Although we incurred cash losses upon settlement of our forward starting, we benefited from the exceptionally low interest rate environment during these periods relative to the interest rates in effect at the time we entered into the swaps. The fair value of the remaining forward starting swaps was a liability of $175.4 million at December 31, 2012 and $153.9 million at January 31, 2013. 102 Table of Contents Commodity Hedging Activities The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps, basis swaps and options contracts. The following table summarizes our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2012 (volume measures as noted): Volume (1) Accounting Derivative Purpose Current (2) Long-Term (2) Treatment Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Octane enhancement: Forecasted purchases of NGLs (MMBbls) 1.3 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of octane enhancement products (MMBbls) 2.8 0.1 Cash flow hedge Natural gas marketing: Forecasted sales of natural gas (Bcf) 3.2 n/a Cash flow hedge Natural gas storage inventory management activities (Bcf) 16.2 n/a Fair value hedge NGL marketing: Forecasted purchases of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 2.6 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 5.5 n/a Cash flow hedge Refined products marketing: Forecasted purchases of refined products (MMBbls) 0.8 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of refined products (MMBbls) 1.3 n/a Cash flow hedge Refined products inventory management activities (MMBbls) 0.1 n/a Fair value hedge Crude oil marketing: Forecasted purchases of crude oil (MMBbls) 3.1 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of crude oil (MMBbls) 6.2 n/a Cash flow hedge Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas risk management activities (Bcf) (3,4) 138.6 24.7 Mark-to-market Refined products risk management activities (MMBbls) (4) 0.8 n/a Mark-to-market Crude oil risk management activities (MMBbls) (4) 3.9 n/a Mark-to-market (1) Volume for derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflects the total amount of volumes hedged whereas volume for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflects the absolute value of derivative notional volumes. (2) The maximum term for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is January 2014, October 2013 and October 2015, respectively. (3) Current volumes include 39.3 Bcf of physical derivative instruments that are predominantly priced at an index plus a premium or minus a discount related to location differences. (4) Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with transportation, processing and storage assets. As of February 1, 2013, our predominant commodity hedging strategies were (i) hedging anticipated future contracted sales of NGLs, refined products and crude oil associated with volumes held in inventory and (ii) hedging the fair value of natural gas and refined products in inventory. We did not have any hedges in place with respect to gross margins associated with our future natural gas processing activities. The following information summarizes these hedging strategies: § The objective of our NGL, refined products and crude oil sales hedging program is to hedge the margins of anticipated future sales of inventory by locking in sales prices through the use of forward physical sales contracts and commodity derivative instruments. § The objective of our natural gas and refined products inventory hedging program is to hedge the fair value of natural gas and refined products currently held in inventory by locking in the sales price of the inventory through the use of commodity derivative instruments. § The objective of our natural gas processing strategy is to hedge an amount of gross margin associated with our natural gas processing activities. No such hedges were in place as of February 1, 2013. Management continues to evaluate market conditions to determine the appropriate timing, if at all, of implementing this strategy during 2013. When in use, this strategy uses physical and financial instruments to lock in the purchase prices of natural gas consumed as plant thermal reduction (""PTR"") and the sales prices of the related NGL products. This program would consist of (i) the forward sale of a portion of our expected 103 Table of Contents equity NGL production at fixed prices for a selected period of time (e.g. through December 31, 2013), which would be achieved through the use of forward physical sales contracts and commodity derivative instruments and (ii) the purchase of commodity derivative instruments having a notional amount based on the volume of natural gas expected to be consumed as PTR in the production of such equity NGL production. Certain basis swaps, basis spread options and other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are used to manage market risks associated with anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas necessary to optimize our owned and contractually committed transportation and storage capacity. There is some uncertainty involved in the timing of these transactions often due to the development of more favorable profit opportunities or when spreads are insufficient to cover variable costs thus reducing the likelihood that the transactions will occur as originally forecasted. As a result of this timing uncertainty, these derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting even though they are effective at managing the risk exposures of these assets. The earnings volatility caused by fluctuations in non-cash, mark-to-market earnings cannot be predicted and the impact to earnings could be material.

Overview of Business We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") under the ticker symbol ""EPD."" We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids (""NGLs"") related businesses of EPCO and are now a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the U.S., Canada and Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. Our midstream energy operations currently include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and import and export terminals (including liquefied petroleum gas or ""LPG""); crude oil gathering, transportation, storage and terminals; offshore production platforms; petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage and terminals, and related services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems and in the Gulf of Mexico. Our assets include approximately 51,300 miles of onshore and offshore pipelines; 225 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, petrochemicals, refined products and crude oil; and 14 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity. In addition, our asset portfolio includes 24 natural gas processing plants, 22 NGL and propylene fractionators, six offshore hub platforms located in the Gulf of Mexico, a butane isomerization complex, NGL import and LPG export terminals, a refined products export terminal and octane enhancement and high-purity isobutylene production facilities. On October 1, 2014, we announced our acquisition of the general partner and certain limited partner interests of Oiltanking Partners, L.P. (""Oiltanking""). See ""Significant Recent Developments"" within this Part II, Item 7 for information regarding this business combination. We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (""ASA"") or by other service providers. We have five reportable business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services; (ii) Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services; (iii) Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services; (iv) Offshore Pipelines & Services; and (v) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. For information regarding our business segments see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Significant Recent Developments Acquisition of Oiltanking Partners, L.P. On October 1, 2014, we acquired Oiltanking GP and the related incentive distribution rights, 15,899,802 common units and 38,899,802 subordinated units of Oiltanking from OTA. We paid total consideration of approximately $4.4 billion to OTA comprised of $2.21 billion in cash and 54,807,352 Enterprise common units for these ownership interests and rights. We also paid $228.3 million to assume the outstanding loans, including related accrued interest, owed by Oiltanking or its subsidiaries to OTA. Collectively, these transactions are referred to as ""Step 1"" of the Oiltanking acquisition. We funded the cash consideration for the Step 1 transactions using borrowings under our new $1.5 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement, proceeds from the sale of short-term notes under our commercial paper program and cash on hand. 71 Table of Contents Oiltanking owns marine terminals located on the Houston Ship Channel and at the Port of Beaumont with a total of 12 ship and barge docks and approximately 26 MMBbls of crude oil and petroleum products storage capacity. Oiltanking's marine terminal on the Houston Ship Channel is connected by pipeline to our Mont Belvieu, Texas complex and is integral to our growing LPG export, crude oil storage and octane enhancement and propylene businesses. Our Enterprise Crude Houston (""ECHO"") facility is also connected to Oiltanking's system. We have had a strategic relationship and enjoyed mutual growth with Oiltanking and its predecessors since 1983. The combination of our legacy midstream assets and Oiltanking's access to waterborne markets and crude oil and petroleum products storage assets extends and broadens our midstream energy services business. We believe this combination benefits our producing and consuming customers by enhancing their respective access to supplies, domestic and international markets, and storage. Following Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition, but not part of Step 2 of the acquisition, on November 17, 2014, the 38,899,802 Oiltanking subordinated units held by Enterprise automatically converted into an equal number of Oiltanking common units pursuant to the terms of the Oiltanking partnership agreement. Following this conversion, Enterprise owned 54,799,604 Oiltanking common units, or approximately 65.9% of Oiltanking's outstanding common units. As a second step of the Oiltanking acquisition (separately negotiated by the conflicts committee of Oiltanking's general partner on behalf of Oiltanking), we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""merger agreement"") with Oiltanking on November 11, 2014 that provided for the following: § the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Enterprise with and into Oiltanking, with Oiltanking surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Enterprise (the ""Oiltanking Merger""); and § all outstanding common units of Oiltanking at the effective time of the merger held by Oiltanking's public unitholders (which consist of Oiltanking unitholders other than Enterprise and its subsidiaries) to be cancelled and converted into Enterprise common units based on an exchange ratio of 1.30 Enterprise common units for each Oiltanking common unit. In accordance with the merger agreement and Oiltanking's partnership agreement, the merger was submitted to a vote of Oiltanking's common unitholders, with the required majority of unitholders (including Enterprise's ownership interests representing approximately 65.9% of Oiltanking's outstanding common units) voting to approve the merger on February 13, 2015. Upon approval of the merger, a total of 36,827,557 Enterprise common units were issued to Oiltanking's former public unitholders. After taking into account the aggregate value of consideration issued and paid in the Oiltanking acquisition, our total cost to acquire Oiltanking was approximately $5.9 billion. In connection with Step 1 of the transaction, we entered into a Liquidity Option Agreement with OTA and Marquard & Bahls (""M&B""), an affiliate of OTA. Pursuant to the Liquidity Option Agreement, we granted M&B the option (the ""Liquidity Option"") to sell to Enterprise 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OTA (the ""Option Securities"") at any time within a 90-day period commencing on February 1, 2020. At that time, OTA's only significant asset would be the Enterprise common units it received in Step 1, to the extent that such common units are not sold by M&B prior to the Liquidity Option exercise date. If this put option is exercised, the aggregate consideration to be paid by us for the Option Securities would equal 100% of the then-current fair market value of the OTA-owned Enterprise common units at the closing of the transactions contemplated under the Liquidity Option Agreement. The fair market value would be determined by multiplying the number of Enterprise common units owned by OTA at the time of exercise by the volume-weighted sales price per unit of Enterprise common units as reported by the NYSE (or other national securities exchange, as applicable) for the ten (10) consecutive trading days preceding the exercise. The consideration paid may be in the form of newly issued Enterprise common units, cash or any mix thereof, as determined solely by us. The Liquidity Option Agreement contains indemnification by M&B for certain specified liabilities of OTA following the closing of any exercise of the Liquidity Option, and certain conditions to closing. If a defined ""Trigger Event"" occurs, the Liquidity Option may be exercised earlier within a 135-day period following notice of such event. The aggregate consideration to be paid by us for the Option Securities in connection 72 Table of Contents with an exercise of the option due to a Trigger Event will be solely cash, determined in the same manner as the price otherwise payable upon the exercise of the Liquidity Option in the absence of a Trigger Event. See ""Recent Issuance of Unregistered Securities"" under Part II, Item 5 for information regarding a registration rights agreement we entered into in connection with the 54,807,352 common units issued as consideration in Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition. OTA is wholly owned by an affiliate of Oiltanking GmbH, an independent storage provider for crude oil, refined products, liquid chemicals and gases headquartered in Hamburg, Germany. Dr. F. Christian Flach, managing director of Oiltanking GmbH and former chairman of the board of Oiltanking, was named as a director of our general partner in connection with our acquisition of Oiltanking. For additional information regarding Dr. Flach, see Part III, Item 10 of this annual report. As a result of our acquisition of Oiltanking GP, we began consolidating the financial statements of Oiltanking and its general partner on October 1, 2014. This business combination was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires us to allocate the cost of a business combination to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the transaction date. For information regarding our accounting for this business combination, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. On February 23, 2015, we received a Civil Investigative Demand and a related Subpoena Duces Tecum from the Federal Trade Commission requesting specified information relating to the Oiltanking acquisition. We are in the process of complying with the requests and are cooperating with the investigation. Based on the limited information that Enterprise has at this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of the investigation. Expansion of Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System In November 2014, we, along with Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (""Plains"") announced an expansion of our Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System in South Texas. The expansion project entails the construction of a new 55-mile crude oil gathering system that will connect Karnes County and Live Oak County production areas in Texas to the joint venture's Three Rivers, Texas terminal. The joint venture will also construct an additional 70-mile, 20-inch pipeline from Three Rivers to Corpus Christi, Texas as well as expand storage and pumping capacity at Three Rivers. When combined with the expansion project announced in September 2013, this project effectively loops the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System from Gardendale, Texas to Corpus Christi and increases the system's capacity to transport light and medium grades of crude oil to over 600 MBPD. These expansions are supported by a long-term production commitment and are expected to be placed into service in the third quarter of 2015. Plains and Enterprise will also construct a new deep water terminal on the Corpus Christi ship channel to support the expected increase in crude oil volumes to be shipped via pipeline to the region. The dock is being designed to handle a variety of ocean-going vessels and is planned to be in service by 2017. Plans to Construct Additional Midstream Infrastructure to Serve the Delaware Basin In September 2014, we announced plans to construct a new cryogenic natural gas processing plant in Eddy County, New Mexico and associated natural gas and NGL pipeline infrastructure to facilitate growing production of NGL-rich natural gas in the Delaware Basin, a prolific production area in West Texas and southern New Mexico. These assets are expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2016. The South Eddy natural gas processing plant is expected to have an initial capacity of 200 MMcf/d of natural gas, with the potential for future expansions. Upon completion, this will bring our total natural gas processing plant capacity in the Delaware Basin to 400 MMcf/d. To supply the new South Eddy plant, we plan to construct approximately 80 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines to complement our existing 1,500 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines located in the Delaware Basin. We also expect to build a 75-mile, 12-inch diameter NGL pipeline to transport NGLs from the South Eddy plant to our Hobbs NGL fractionation and storage facility located in Gaines County, Texas. As a result of multiple pipeline 73 Table of Contents connections at our Hobbs facility, shippers will have access to our NGL fractionation and storage complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Additionally, we plan to deliver residue gas from the South Eddy plant through new interconnections with existing third party pipelines. Initial Stage of Aegis Ethane Pipeline Completed In September 2014, we announced that the first segment, or 60 miles, of our Aegis Ethane Pipeline was complete and ready to commence ethane deliveries between our Mont Belvieu storage complex and Beaumont, Texas. The 270-mile Aegis Ethane Pipeline (or ""Aegis"") represents a key component of our planned ethane header system stretching from Corpus Christi, Texas to the Mississippi River in Louisiana. After taking into account existing South Texas midstream infrastructure and completion of the first segment of Aegis, this 500-mile ethane header system is now in service from Corpus Christi to Beaumont. The remainder of Aegis will be completed in two phases. The next segment between Beaumont and Lake Charles, Louisiana is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2015. The final segment from Lake Charles to the Mississippi River is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. Plans to Build Ninth NGL Fractionator at Our Mont Belvieu, Texas Complex In September 2014, we announced plans to build a ninth NGL fractionator adjacent to our complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas. If constructed, the ninth fractionator is expected to have a capacity of 85 MBPD. We have secured the required permits and emission credits for the ninth and a possible, similarly-sized tenth NGL fractionator at Mont Belvieu. We are evaluating the timing of these projects in light of current business conditions. SEKCO Oil Pipeline Completed The SEKCO Oil Pipeline was completed in July 2014, with crude oil shipments starting in January 2015 when the Lucius oil and gas field commenced operations. The SEKCO Oil Pipeline is owned by Southeast Keathley Canyon Pipeline Company, L.L.C., which is owned 50% by us and 50% by Genesis Energy, L.P. The SEKCO Oil Pipeline is a 149-mile crude oil gathering pipeline serving producers in the Lucius oil and gas field located in the southern Keathley Canyon area of the deepwater central Gulf of Mexico. The new pipeline connects the third party-owned Lucius-truss spar floating production platform to an existing junction platform at South Marsh Island 205, which is part of our Poseidon Oil Pipeline System. We serve as operator of the SEKCO Oil Pipeline, which has a capacity of 115 MBPD. Seaway Crude Oil Pipeline Loop Completed In June 2014, Seaway Crude Pipeline Company LLC (""Seaway"") completed a pipeline looping project involving its Longhaul System. This expansion project included the construction of an additional 512-mile, 30-inch pipeline that transports crude oil south from the Cushing hub to Seaway's Jones Creek terminal. With the looping project complete, the aggregate transportation capacity of the Longhaul System is approximately 850 MBPD, depending on the type and mix of crude oil being transported and other variables. Crude oil deliveries using the new pipeline (referred to as the ""Seaway Pipeline looping project"") commenced in December 2014. Seaway's Jones Creek terminal is connected to our ECHO crude oil storage facility located in Houston, Texas by a 65-mile, 36-inch pipeline. Construction of a 100-mile, 30-inch pipeline from ECHO to Beaumont/Port Arthur, Texas, was also completed in July 2014. These new pipeline construction projects complement ongoing expansion activities at ECHO, which include the completion of three new storage tanks during the second quarter of 2014. Marine Terminal Begins Exporting Refined Products In May 2014, we began loading cargoes of refined products for export on our reactivated marine terminal in Beaumont, Texas, and within six months the facility was sold out. Located on the Neches River, the terminal can load at rates up to 15,000 barrels per hour. The facility includes a dock with a 40-foot draft that can accommodate Panamax size vessels that have a capacity of up to 400,000 barrels. The terminal has access to more than 12.0 MMBbls of refined products storage and receives products from eight refineries, representing approximately 3.3 74 Table of Contents MMBPD of capacity, as well as the Colonial Pipeline. The costs for improvements and modifications required to resume operations at the terminal, which included channel dredging, new pipeline construction, and the installation of new loading arms and vapor recovery systems, are supported by long-term customer commitments. Ongoing expansion of the Beaumont refined products terminal, also supported by long-term customer commitments, includes significant additional on-site storage and ancillary equipment for gasoline blending operations. With its strategic location and enhanced capabilities, the Beaumont marine terminal provides optionality for customers, allowing them to capture added value from the evolving fundamentals of the domestic and international refined products markets. Plans to Construct Ethane Export Facility on Houston Ship Channel In April 2014, we announced plans to construct a fully refrigerated ethane export facility on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The new facility, which is located on the Houston Ship Channel, is expected to have an aggregate loading rate of approximately 10,000 barrels per hour and is supported by long-term contracts. We expect the ethane export facility to begin operations in the third quarter of 2016. Our ethane export facility will provide new markets for domestically-produced ethane, and will assist U.S. producers in increasing their associated production of natural gas and crude oil. We estimate that U.S. ethane production capacity currently exceeds U.S. demand by 300 MBPD and could exceed demand by up to 700 MBPD by 2020, after considering the estimated incremental demand from new ethylene facilities that have been announced. The ethane export facility will be integrated with our Mont Belvieu complex. Our Mont Belvieu complex receives NGL supplies from several major producing basins across the U.S., including the Marcellus and Utica Shales via our recently completed Appalachia-to-Texas Express (""ATEX"") ethane pipeline. We believe that our integrated NGL system offers supply assurance and diversification for the ethane export facility. Front Range Pipeline Begins Operations Our Front Range Pipeline commenced operations in February 2014. This 435-mile pipeline transports NGLs originating from the Denver-Julesburg production basin in Weld County, Colorado to Skellytown, Texas in Carson County. With connections to our Mid-America Pipeline System and Texas Express Pipeline, the Front Range Pipeline provides producers in the Denver-Julesburg basin with access to the Gulf Coast, which is the largest NGL market in the U.S. Initial throughput capacity for the Front Range Pipeline is 150 MBPD, which could be expanded to approximately 230 MBPD with certain system modifications. The Front Range Pipeline is owned by Front Range Pipeline LLC, which is a joint venture among us and affiliates of DCP Midstream Partners LP and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. We operate the Front Range Pipeline and own a one-third member interest in Front Range Pipeline LLC. ATEX Pipeline Begins Operations Our ATEX pipeline, which commenced operations in January 2014, transports ethane primarily southbound from NGL fractionation plants located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to our Mont Belvieu storage complex. The ethane extracted by these fractionation facilities originates from the Marcellus and Utica Shale production areas. In addition to newly constructed pipeline segments, significant portions of the ATEX pipeline consist of segments that were formerly used in refined products transportation service by our TE Products Pipeline. Initial throughput capacity for the ATEX pipeline is 125 MBPD, which could be expanded to approximately 265 MBPD with certain system modifications. ATEX terminates at our Mont Belvieu storage facility, which includes an extensive pipeline distribution system. With the addition of our Aegis Ethane Pipeline, we will, through our Mont Belvieu facilities, link Marcellus and Utica Shale-produced ethane to existing ethylene production facilities along the U.S. Gulf Coast and provide supply security to support construction of new third party ethylene plants currently planned in Texas and Louisiana. 75 Table of Contents Expansion of Houston Ship Channel LPG Export Terminal We provide customers with LPG export services at our marine terminal located on the Houston Ship Channel. This terminal has the capability to load cargoes of fully refrigerated, low-ethane propane and/or butane onto multiple tanker vessels simultaneously. In March 2013, we completed an expansion project at this terminal that increased its loading capability from 4.0 MMBbls per month to 7.5 MMBbls per month. Our LPG export services continue to benefit from increased NGL supplies produced from domestic shale plays such as the Eagle Ford Shale and strong international demand for propane as a feedstock in ethylene plant operations and for power generation and heating purposes. In September 2013, we announced an expansion project at this LPG export terminal that is expected to increase its ability to load cargoes from 7.5 MMBbls per month to approximately 9.0 MMBbls per month. This expansion project is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015. In January 2014, we announced a further expansion of this LPG export terminal that is expected to increase its ability to load cargoes from approximately 9.0 MMBbls per month to in excess of 16.0 MMBbls per month. Once this expansion project is completed, we expect our maximum loading capacity at this export terminal will be approximately 27,000 barrels per hour. The expanded LPG export terminal is expected to be in service by the end of 2015 and is supported by long-term LPG export agreements. Mid-America Pipeline System's Rocky Mountain Expansion Project Begins Operations In January 2014, we announced the completion of an expansion project involving the Rocky Mountain pipeline of our Mid-America Pipeline System. This expansion project involved looping 265 miles of the Rocky Mountain pipeline, as well as related pump station modifications, which increased transportation capacity on the pipeline from approximately 275 MBPD to 350 MBPD. This expansion project was built to accommodate growing natural gas and NGL production from major supply basins in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. Commercial and Liquidity Outlook for 2015 Commercial Outlook for 2015 We provide midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Factors that can affect the demand for our products and services include domestic and international economic conditions, the market price and demand for energy, the cost to develop natural gas and crude oil reserves in the U.S., state and federal regulation, and the cost and availability of capital to energy companies to invest in upstream exploration and production activities. As a result of significant advances in non-conventional drilling and production technology, North American reserves and production of hydrocarbons from shale developments have increased substantially. The rapid increase in U.S. hydrocarbon supplies has led to a reduction in imports of crude oil, NGLs, refined products and natural gas into the U.S. Conversely, this trend has also resulted in significant increases in hydrocarbon exports from the U.S., particularly of refined products and LPGs, and contributed to price volatility in the price of natural gas and NGLs, especially of ethane. In the summer and fall of 2014, oil economists, including those at the International Energy Agency, began to express concerns about a growing global excess of crude oil and refined products in light of a weaker global economic outlook (especially for Europe and China) and in the face of surging supplies from the U.S. as well as production growth from Iraq, Libya, Iran and certain African countries. In the fall of 2014, the market began to see signals of growing crude oil inventories coupled with unusual monthly discounts from OPEC nations to certain markets in order to retain their market share. On November 27, 2014, OPEC met for a regularly scheduled meeting and could not agree to cut their crude oil production in order to stabilize global oil prices. In addition to not cutting production, as part of the November meeting, Saudi Arabia indicated that it believed that market forces, rather than OPEC's self-imposed quotas, should determine global oil prices. As a result of no production cuts from OPEC and the strong communication from Saudi Arabia, oil prices rapidly deteriorated, falling quickly from approximately $75 per barrel to $45 per barrel by the end of January 2015. 76 Table of Contents The collapse in crude oil prices is impacting market dynamics for hydrocarbons around the world, resulting in uncertainty in supply and demand fundamentals for crude oil, refined products, NGLs, natural gas and other energy-intensive products including petrochemicals. While it is impossible to predict exactly how lower energy commodity prices will impact us in 2015, we expect that an extended period of significantly lower crude oil and NGL prices will slow drilling activity in the regions we serve, which ultimately could reduce the overall supply of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs available to our facilities. While all domestic production basins are expected to be impacted in 2015, we expect the largest reductions in drilling activity will be in domestic supply basins located farthest from the U.S. Gulf Coast. Although the exact impact of drilling and well completions is uncertain, we currently believe that producers will remain focused on the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin regions because of their favorable returns on capital and relative close proximity to Gulf Coast markets, which increases their net operating cash flows compared to other more distant producing regions. It is too early to predict how drilling programs in other plays farther from the Gulf Coast will be impacted, but we expect that many basins that have lower returns on capital due to higher transportation costs will likely experience a significant reduction in drilling activity until crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices improve. Many producers have indicated that they expect to negotiate reductions in their drilling and completion costs to help mitigate some of the impact from energy commodity falling prices. Nevertheless, many producers are indicating that they expect their production to continue to increase in 2015 compared to 2014 as they work through significant completion backlogs and drilling/contractual commitments and rely on financial hedges to help support their near-term cash flow needs. Once these backlogs and commitments are satisfied and any financial hedges settle, producers are generally uncertain about their post-2015 drilling and production plans in light of the current commodity price environment. Lower energy commodity prices for an extended period of time could lead to significant and prolonged reductions in drilling activity that would eventually result in lower production volumes and could negatively impact our gross operating margins relative to natural gas processing, pipeline operations and NGL fractionation, and could also adversely affect regional price spreads that could lower results from our marketing activities. In addition, lower energy commodity prices over an extended period of time could contribute to a decrease in our capital spending for new assets or expansion opportunities for existing assets. Certain producers have already announced significant reductions in their capital budgets and production plans for 2015, and others have said that they are in the process of revising their 2015 capital budgets in light of the decline in crude oil prices. Furthermore, producers that have published capital spending and production estimates for 2015 have, in general, noted that they are subject to change as the current situation develops. In contrast to the negative impacts on energy producers, lower energy costs could lead to an increase in energy consumption and an increase in investments in energy intensive industries (e.g., steel manufacturing and industrial chemicals) as lower energy costs reduce the variable costs of such industries and improve investment returns of some projects. An increase in demand for crude oil or NGLs from these types of industries, along with other positive consumer-driven demand responses to the lower prices, may help to balance crude oil supply and demand fundamentals by the end of 2015. Regardless of such market dynamics, almost all of the assets we have under construction or have recently completed, whether supply or end-use oriented, are backed by significant long-term fee-based commitments from shippers and/or end-use customers. In addition, many of our recent pipeline projects are backed by contractual volume commitments over the next several years (e.g., shipper commitments on our ATEX, Texas Express and Front Range pipelines), thus providing support to the cash flows generated by these assets. For additional information regarding our recent significant projects, see ""Significant Recent Developments"" within this Part II, Item 7. Natural gas has been trading at a significant discount to crude oil for the last several years due to changes in supply and demand fundamentals and, in spite of the recent downturn in crude oil prices, natural gas continues to trade at a significant discount relative to historical norms. For example, on an energy-equivalent basis, natural gas prices for 2015 are forecast to be 30% to 36% of the price of crude oil (based on prices quoted in futures markets in January 2015). For 2014 and 2013, natural gas was priced at 27% and 22% of crude oil on an energy-equivalent basis, respectively. In addition, ethane prices have decreased over time in terms of price per gallon and as a percentage relative to the price of crude oil on an energy-equivalent basis. The decline in ethane prices is attributable to excess domestic supply. For example, the average price of ethane in 2012 was $0.40 per gallon (or 37% of the relative price of crude oil on an energy-equivalent basis). The average price of ethane continued to decline in 2013, 77 Table of Contents decreasing to $0.26 per gallon (or 23% of the relative price of crude oil on an energy-equivalent basis) and averaged $0.27 per gallon (or 25% of the relative price of crude oil on an energy-equivalent basis) in 2014. At the end of January 2015, ethane was priced at $0.18 per gallon (or 36% of the relative price of crude oil on an energy-equivalent basis). As a result of these natural gas and ethane price trends, producers have significantly decreased their drilling activity in onshore areas where natural gas production is considered ""dry"" or ""lean"" (i.e., the amount of NGLs produced in connection with the natural gas production is relatively small) and have focused more on NGL-rich natural gas and crude oil developments over the last several years. A similar trend is also occurring in the Gulf of Mexico, with producers investing capital to develop new sources of crude oil production rather than areas where natural gas production is prevalent. In general, the focus on crude oil and NGL-rich supply basins by producers has contributed to significant increases in domestic production of these hydrocarbons. The excess supply and inventories have led to lower prices for these energy commodities and contributed to a global focus on exports of U.S. hydrocarbons, to the extent such exports are permitted by U.S. governmental authorities. U.S. LPG exports continue to increase as a result of ample supplies, increased export capacity and competitive prices as compared to international markets. Overall, U.S. propane waterborne exports increased from approximately 153 MBPD in 2012 to 288 MBPD in 2013 and to 403 MBPD in 2014. Markets in Central and South America have been the major source of new demand for U.S. LPG exports; however, volumes are also being transported to Northwest Europe and Far East Asia. LPG exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Central and South America are expected to increase in the future. Similarly, greater volumes of Gulf Coast-sourced LPGs are expected to reach Asian markets after the anticipated Panama Canal expansion is completed (currently forecast for early 2016). This expansion project is expected to make LPG exports from the Gulf Coast to Asia more economical for shippers, allowing Asian importers to further diversify their sources of LPGs beyond their traditional Middle East suppliers. In 2014, U.S. ethane exports were generally limited to petrochemical customers in Canada that could receive volumes by pipeline. Due to the renewed focus on hydrocarbon exports, we are actively growing our ability to provide services and products to Gulf Coast exporters. We are currently the largest supplier of propane to such exporters, and are nearly doubling the LPG export capacity at our Houston Ship Channel terminal over the next 18 months. In April 2014, we commenced construction of a large-scale marine ethane export facility, which will be located at Morgan's Point on the Houston Ship Channel. Our ethane export dock will be strategically linked to our Mont Belvieu storage, fractionation and pipeline assets. The construction and operation of the ethane export dock is supported by long-term commitments for approximately 80% of the facility's projected capacity and several customers have expressed interest in the remaining capacity and possible expansions. In May 2014, we began loading cargoes of refined products for export on our reactivated marine terminal in Beaumont, Texas. We are also expanding this terminal with additional on-site storage and ancillary equipment for gasoline blending operations. Reactivation of the terminal, as well as its expansion, was supported by long-term customer commitments. With its strategic location and enhanced capabilities, the Beaumont Refined Products Export Terminal provides optionality for exporters, allowing them to capture added value from the evolving fundamentals of the domestic and international refined products markets. In October 2014, we completed Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition (see ""Significant Recent Developments"" within this Part II, Item 7). In February 2015, the Oiltanking Merger was completed. The combination of our legacy midstream assets and Oiltanking's access to waterborne markets and crude oil and petroleum products storage assets extends and broadens our midstream energy services business. We believe this combination benefits our producing and consuming customers by enhancing their respective access to supplies, domestic and international markets, and storage. In recent years, natural gas and NGLs developed a significant feedstock price advantage over more costly crude oil derivatives (such as naphtha). We expect this trend to continue based on energy prices quoted on futures markets in January 2015 and due to: (i) ongoing production from domestic shale resource plays and efforts by producers to lower associated drilling costs; (ii) anticipated increases in demand for crude oil by China, India and other developing economies; and (iii) geopolitical risks in many areas of the world that are major exporters of crude oil, which may cause unexpected crude oil price increases. In addition, this trend is supported in the near term by a 78 Table of Contents lack of meaningful infrastructure to export natural gas and ethane supplies from the U.S., which results in an oversupply and lower market values for both energy commodities. As a result of the feedstock price advantage currently held by natural gas and NGLs, energy consumers in the industrial manufacturing and power generation sectors are continuing to adjust their feedstock and asset portfolios to consume increasing amounts of these commodities in their operations. In addition, we believe the feedstock price advantage of domestically-produced NGLs has led to a long-term fundamental change in feedstock selection by the U.S. petrochemical industry, which is the largest consumer of domestic NGLs. Since NGLs typically trade at a significant discount to crude oil, using NGLs as a feedstock generally provides a substantial cost advantage for U.S. petrochemical companies when compared to using naphtha, whose price is closely linked to international crude prices. From 2009 through 2014, ethane and propane have generally been the most profitable feedstocks in the production of ethylene. In order to capitalize on this cost advantage, U.S. petrochemical companies have maximized their consumption of domestic NGLs, particularly ethane, in the production of ethylene. Many of these companies have also announced plans to invest billions of dollars to construct NGL feedstock-oriented, world-scale ethylene plants on the Gulf Coast. For example: § CP Chemical announced in December 2011 that it expects to build a 1.5 million metric tons per year ethylene plant in Cedar Bayou, Texas by 2017; § Formosa Plastics announced in March 2012 that it expects to build an 800 thousand metric tons per year ethylene plant along the U.S. Gulf Coast by 2016/2017; § Dow Chemical announced in April 2012 that it expects to build a 1.5 million metric tons per year ethylene plant along the U.S. Gulf Coast by 2017; § Sasol announced in October 2014 that they had reached final approval to build a 1.5 million metric ton per year ethylene plant in Lake Charles Louisiana; and § numerous other petrochemical companies have announced significant expansions and or conversions to ethane for at existing facilities. Almost all of these ethylene plants and the ethylene industry's major expansions are in close proximity to our existing or planned assets, including our Aegis Ethane Pipeline. Based on industry publications, domestic production of ethylene in 2014 was estimated to be 145 million pounds per day compared to 148 million pounds per day in 2013. Ethane is the most widely used feedstock by the U.S. petrochemical industry in the production of ethylene. As a result, ethane consumption by domestic petrochemical companies has, at times, been in excess of 1.1 MMBPD. We believe the U.S. ethylene industry could consume approximately 200 MBPD of additional ethane feedstocks over the next few years through modifications, debottlenecking and expansions at existing facilities. In addition, we believe that announced new petrochemical plant construction projects, including those noted in the preceding paragraph, could consume well over 500 MBPD of additional ethane feedstocks when completed. However, for almost all of 2014, ethane production was in excess of the ethylene industry's ability to consume ethane, resulting in significant volumes of ethane not being extracted from the natural gas stream by producers and natural gas processors in an effort to balance ethane supply to demand. In the absence of additional near-term demand growth or a significant drop in production, we expect ethane to remain oversupplied. This could lower the value of our equity NGL production and reduce the volumes that would otherwise be handled by our downstream NGL fractionators and pipelines. Drilling activity in shale plays with predominantly dry natural gas production or natural gas production with a lower NGL content (e.g., the Haynesville/Bossier, Barnett, Fayetteville, Piceance and Jonah/Pinedale shales) are expected to remain well below peak levels. As a result, we expect that natural gas volumes on pipelines that serve these supply basins, including our Jonah, Piceance Basin, San Juan and Haynesville gathering systems, may decline further in 2015 when compared to 2014. Although these supply basins are currently experiencing production declines, we believe that these areas have substantial, undeveloped natural gas reserves with some of the lowest development and production costs in the U.S. Furthermore, we believe that as U.S. supply and demand for natural gas and ethane becomes more balanced through exports of these commodities and, as a result, natural gas 79 Table of Contents and ethane prices stabilize and increase, these supply basins could experience an increase in drilling activity to support, and potentially increase, their future production levels. With respect to the Gulf of Mexico, we expect that transportation volumes on our offshore crude oil pipelines will continue to increase in the near term as significant deepwater prospects begin production. For example, our SEKCO Oil Pipeline, which serves the Lucius field located in the southern Keathley Canyon area of the deepwater central Gulf of Mexico, commenced operations during the first quarter of 2015. Conversely, we expect that throughput volumes on our offshore Gulf of Mexico natural gas pipelines will continue to decline in 2015 due to producers focusing more of their near-term resources to exploit offshore crude oil developments and onshore NGL-rich natural gas and crude oil producing areas; however, increases in natural gas production associated with oil production are expected to temper the overall decline in Gulf of Mexico natural gas production. Development of hydrocarbon reserves in the Gulf of Mexico is capital intensive and projects typically have long lead times. At this time, we are uncertain what, if any, effect the current environment of lower hydrocarbon prices will have on producers' intermediate plans to explore and develop reserves in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of crude oil pipeline infrastructure expansions, including the Seaway Pipeline looping project we placed into service in 2014, producers have greater access to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. This is evident in a significant narrowing of the differential in 2014 between Light Louisiana Sweet (""LLS"") and West Texas Intermediate (""WTI""), which saw the premium of LLS compared to WTI (based on their average indicative price spread) narrow from $9.35 per barrel in 2013 to $3.61 per barrel in 2014 and $1.56 per barrel at the end of January 2015. The narrowing of the premium was a direct result of over 1.2 MMBPD of new pipeline capacity being placed into service between the Cushing hub and the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2014. With approximately 8.5 MMBPD of refining capacity along the Gulf Coast, refiners now have access to a wide array of crude types from which to choose, and will vary their crude input stream by employing a mix of domestic production with waterborne imports in order to optimize their operations and profitability. As a result of increasing domestic supplies, the U.S. Gulf Coast has seen crude oil imports fall from 3.7 MMBPD in 2013 to 3.4 MMBPD in 2014, while refinery crude runs on the Gulf Coast increased from 8.1 MMBPD in 2013 to 8.3 MMBPD in 2014. Many domestic refineries are modifying and expanding their facilities in order to process more North American crude oil and are also increasing their refined product exports in order to capture market share in emerging economies, which typically have insufficient refining capacity to satisfy their growing demand. We believe that this increased reliance on domestically-produced crudes will continue in 2015, with refiners further reducing their imports of waterborne crudes (particularly ""light sweet"" crudes). This trend should have a beneficial impact on our crude oil pipeline and storage assets and our refined product export facilities in 2015; however, this outlook may be compromised if there is a prolonged reduction in domestic crude oil drilling and production, or if overseas crude markets become discounted compared to the U.S. Gulf Coast for an extended period. Liquidity Outlook for 2015 At December 31, 2014, we had $4.17 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $74.4 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $4.09 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO's revolving credit facilities. Throughout 2014, the corporate debt and equity capital markets were accessible to us, along with adequate credit availability from banks. Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. We have $2.05 billion of senior notes maturing in 2015 through the first quarter of 2016. We expect to refinance these senior note obligations at or prior to their maturity. The U.S. government is expected to continue to run substantial annual budget deficits in the coming years that will require a corresponding issuance of debt by the U.S. Treasury. The interest rate on U.S. Treasury debt has a direct impact on the cost of our debt. At this time, we are uncertain what impact the expected large issuances of U.S. Treasury debt and the prevailing economic and capital market conditions during these future periods will have on the cost and availability of capital, and we have not executed any interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our expected future debt issuances in connection with the refinancing of debt. We continue to monitor and evaluate the condition of the capital markets and our interest rate risk with respect to refinancing these maturities and funding our capital spending program. 80 Table of Contents For information regarding our capital spending program, including projected 2015 spending levels, see ""Capital Spending"" within this Part II, Item 7.

(4) Crude oil prices are based on commercial index prices for WTI as measured on the New York Mercantile Exchange (""NYMEX"") and for LLS as reported by Platts. Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices. Energy commodity prices fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including supply and demand imbalances and geopolitical tensions. The following is a discussion of changes in key commodity prices affecting our results of operations: § The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs (based on prices for such products at Mont Belvieu, Texas, which is the primary industry hub for domestic NGL production) was $0.97 per gallon for 2014 compared to $1.02 per gallon for 2013 – a 5% year-to-year decrease. With the collapse in crude oil prices in late 2014, the weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs for the fourth quarter of 2014 82 Table of Contents was $0.74 per gallon. NGL prices are expected to follow crude oil prices in 2015, with some measure of recovery expected by the end of 2015. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, ethane volumes account for approximately 35% of NGLs produced from natural gas processing activities. As a result of producers allocating more of their capital budgets to developing NGL-rich shale plays and their success in extracting such resources, ethane production has increased more rapidly than the ethylene industry's current capability to consume the increase in supplies. As a result of this trend, ethane prices declined to an average of $0.26 per gallon in 2013 from an average of $0.40 per gallon in 2012. Ethane prices in 2014 averaged $0.27 per gallon as ethane production growth was tempered by ethane rejection at natural gas processing plants; however, average ethane prices decreased to $0.21 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2014 mirroring the general decline in energy prices. § The market price of natural gas (as measured at the Henry Hub in Louisiana) averaged $4.43 per MMBtu for 2014 compared to $3.65 per MMBtu during 2013 – a 21% year-to-year increase. The increase in prices is generally due to higher natural gas demand for power generation and as a heating fuel. § The market price of WTI crude oil (as measured on the NYMEX) averaged $93.01 per barrel for 2014 compared to $97.97 per barrel for 2013. Although average WTI prices declined only 5% year-to-year, they (along with other crude oil price benchmarks) declined sharply in the fourth quarter of 2014 to an average of $73.15 per barrel (hitting a low in December 2014 of $53.27 per barrel). In January 2015, WTI crude oil prices averaged $47.33 per barrel. See ""Commercial Outlook for 2015"" within this Part II, Item 7 for a discussion of the recent decline in global crude oil prices and its potential impact on our operations. A decrease in our consolidated marketing revenues due to lower energy commodity sales prices may not result in a decrease in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also be lower due to comparable decreases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same correlation would be true in the case of higher energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs. We attempt to mitigate any commodity price exposure through our hedging activities as well as through converting keepwhole and similar contracts to fee-based arrangements. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities. Consolidated Income Statement Highlights The following information highlights significant changes in our comparative income statement amounts and the primary drivers of such changes. Comparison of 2014 with 2013 Revenues. Revenues for 2014 increased $224.2 million when compared to revenues for 2013. Revenues from the marketing of natural gas increased $609.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $534.7 million increase. Revenues from the marketing of refined products increased a net $435.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $502.5 million increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $66.8 million decrease. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil decreased a net $584.5 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $4.59 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $4.01 billion increase. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs decreased $455.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $254.8 million decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $201.1 million decrease. Collectively, revenues from the marketing of octane additives and high purity isobutylene (""HPIB"") decreased $434.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales volumes, which in turn were attributable to lower production volumes caused by unscheduled plant maintenance outages. 83 Table of Contents Revenues from midstream services increased $648.0 million year-to-year primarily due to the ongoing expansion of our operations. Recently completed assets such as the ATEX pipeline and the Rocky Mountain expansion of our Mid-America Pipeline System as well as certain assets in the Eagle Ford Shale and at our Mont Belvieu complex contributed approximately $400 million of this increase. Also, our consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 include $57.5 million from Oiltanking's operations. On October 1, 2014, we acquired a controlling financial interest in Oiltanking; therefore, we began consolidating the financial results of Oiltanking on this date. For additional information regarding the Oiltanking acquisition, see ""Significant Recent Developments"" within this Part II, Item 7. Operating costs and expenses. Total operating costs and expenses for 2014 decreased $18.2 million when compared to 2013. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of natural gas increased $343.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher purchase prices, which accounted for a $283.8 million increase. Cost of sales associated with our marketing of refined products increased a net $400.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher purchase prices, which accounted for a $469.5 million increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $69.1 million decrease. Cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil decreased a net $405.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase costs, which accounted for a $4.25 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $3.84 billion increase. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs decreased $383.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $255.3 million decrease, and lower purchase costs, which accounted for an additional $128.4 million decrease. Collectively, the cost of sales associated with our marketing of octane additives and HPIB decreased $261.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase costs, which accounted for a $160.9 million decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $100.8 million decrease. Other operating costs and expenses increased $231.4 million year-to-year. The primary driver of this increase is the ongoing expansion of our operations, including that associated with recently completed assets being placed into service (e.g., our ATEX pipeline and expansion of the Rocky Mountain segment of our Mid-America Pipeline System). We estimate that asset expansions accounted for approximately $125.0 million of the $231.4 million increase in expense. In addition, the year-to-year increase includes $18.0 million of expense we recorded in 2014 in connection with a producer settlement involving our San Juan Gathering System and a $16.6 million benefit we recognized in 2013, which represents a negative variance year-to-year, attributable to reductions in a provision for certain pipeline capacity obligations. Other operating costs and expenses for 2014 also include $14.8 million of expenses attributable to Oiltanking's operations in the fourth quarter of 2014. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses in operating costs and expenses increased $133.8 million in 2014 when compared to 2013 primarily due to recently constructed assets being placed into service. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2014 includes $25.0 million attributable to Oiltanking for the fourth quarter of 2014. We recorded net gains within operating costs and expenses of $102.1 million attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries in 2014 compared to $83.4 million in 2013. We recognized $95.0 million of gains attributable to the receipt of nonrefundable cash insurance proceeds related to our West Storage claims in 2014 compared to $15.0 million of such gains in 2013. These proceeds were attributable to property damage claims we filed in connection with the February 2011 NGL release and fire at the West Storage location of our Mont Belvieu, Texas underground storage facility. In March 2013, we sold the Stratton Ridge-to-Mont Belvieu segment of the Seminole Pipeline, along with a related storage cavern, and recognized a $52.5 million gain on the sale. General and administrative costs. General and administrative costs for 2014 increased $26.2 million when compared to 2013 primarily due to higher employee compensation costs, which accounted for $17.3 million of the increase, transaction costs of $3.8 million associated with Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition, and $4.7 million of expense for the settlement of litigation. Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates increased $92.2 million in 2014 when compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to increased earnings from our investments in crude oil pipeline joint ventures. 84 Table of Contents Interest expense. Interest expense for 2014 increased $118.5 million when compared to 2013. The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 969.1 $ 911.7 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization 9.4 3.3 Interest cost capitalized in connection with construction projects (1) (77.9 ) (133.0 ) Other (2) 20.4 20.5 Interest expense $ 921.0 $ 802.5 (1) We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) ratably over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate from period-to-period based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital spending levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. (2) Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest charged on debt principal outstanding increased a net $57.4 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2014, which accounted for a $97.9 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates in 2014, which accounted for a $40.5 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2014 was $18.96 billion compared to $17.14 billion for 2013. Our debt principal balances have increased over time primarily due to the partial debt financing of our capital spending program. Capitalized interest decreased $55.1 million year-to-year primarily due to assets being placed into service. For a discussion of our consolidated debt obligations and capital spending program, see ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" within this Part II, Item 7. Income taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $34.4 million in 2014 when compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to changes in our accruals for state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (or ""Texas Margin Tax""). For additional information regarding our income taxes, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $35.9 million in 2014 primarily due to increased earnings from the underlying joint ventures and the inclusion of noncontrolling interests in Oiltanking effective October 1, 2014. Comparison of 2013 with 2012 Revenues. Revenues for 2013 increased $5.14 billion when compared to revenues for 2012. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil increased $2.83 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $2.28 billion increase, and sales prices, which accounted for an additional $543.8 million increase. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs increased a net $1.7 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $3.64 billion increase, partially offset by lower sales prices, which accounted for a $1.94 billion decrease. Revenues from the marketing of natural gas and petrochemical products increased a net $392.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $1.1 billion increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $708.3 million decrease. Revenues from the marketing of refined products decreased a net $106.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $697.7 million decrease, which was partially offset by the impact of higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $590.9 million increase. Revenues from midstream asset services increased $347.2 million year-to-year primarily due to the timing of newly constructed assets being placed into service during these years, particularly those assets associated with the Eagle Ford Shale and at our Mont Belvieu complex. Operating costs and expenses. Total operating costs and expenses for 2013 increased $4.87 billion when compared to 2012 primarily due to a $4.75 billion increase in cost of sales. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil increased $2.59 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted 85 Table of Contents for a $2.15 billion increase, and purchase prices, which accounted for an additional $440.1 million increase. Cost of sales associated with the marketing of NGLs increased a net $1.95 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $3.36 billion increase, partially offset by lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $1.41 billion decrease. Cost of sales associated with our marketing of natural gas and petrochemical products increased a net $377.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher purchase prices, which accounted for a $1.02 billion increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $643.4 million decrease. Cost of sales associated with the marketing of refined products decreased a net $105.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $733.9 million decrease, which was partially offset by the impact of higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $628.8 million increase. Other operating costs and expenses increased a net $65.5 million year-to-year, which includes a $188.8 million increase primarily due to the addition of operating costs of newly constructed assets and higher overall maintenance costs, partially offset by a $123.3 million reduction in operating costs due to the sale of certain trucking and distribution assets in January and April 2013. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses in operating costs and expenses increased $87.2 million for 2013 when compared to 2012 primarily due to the timing of newly constructed assets being placed into service during these periods. We recorded net gains within operating costs and expenses of $83.4 million attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries in 2013 compared to $17.6 million in 2012. In March 2013, we sold the Stratton Ridge-to-Mont Belvieu segment of the Seminole Pipeline, along with a related storage cavern, and recognized a $52.5 million gain on the sale. Also, we recognized $15.0 million of gains in 2013 attributable to the receipt of nonrefundable cash insurance proceeds for claims resulting from the 2011 NGL release and fire at our West Storage location. We recognized $30.0 million of such gains in 2012. Operating costs and expenses include $92.6 million and $63.4 million of non-cash asset impairment charges in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our non-cash asset impairment charges for 2013 primarily relate to the abandonment of certain segments of crude oil and natural gas pipelines in Texas, Oklahoma and the Gulf of Mexico, certain refined products terminal assets in Texas, an NGL storage cavern in Arizona and an NGL fractionator and storage complex in Ohio. Our asset impairment charges for 2012 primarily relate to the abandonment of certain segments of crude oil and natural gas pipelines in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. General and administrative costs. General and administrative costs for 2013 increased $18.0 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to higher employee compensation expenses. Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2013 increased $103.0 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to higher earnings from our investments in crude oil pipeline joint ventures. Interest expense. Interest expense for 2013 increased $30.7 million when compared to 2012. The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 911.7 $ 879.7 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization 3.3 (12.6 ) Interest cost capitalized in connection with construction projects (133.0 ) (116.8 ) Other 20.5 21.5 Interest expense $ 802.5 $ 771.8 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding increased a net $32.0 million for 2013 when compared to 2012 generally due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2013, which accounted for $94.5 million of the increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates in 2013, which accounted for a $62.5 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2013 was $17.14 billion compared to $15.3 86 Table of Contents billion for 2012. As noted previously, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital spending program. Other income. Other non-operating income for 2012 includes $68.8 million of aggregate gains attributable to the liquidation of our investment in Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (""Energy Transfer Equity""). At January 1, 2012, we owned 29,303,514 common units of Energy Transfer Equity representing 13.1% of its limited partner interests. On January 18, 2012, we sold 22,762,636 of these common units in a private transaction, which generated a gain on the sale of $27.5 million. As a result of the January 18, 2012 transaction, our ownership interest in Energy Transfer Equity was reduced below 3%, and we discontinued using the equity method to account for this investment and began accounting for it as an investment in available-for-sale equity securities. Following the January 18, 2012 transaction, we sold the remaining 6,540,878 Energy Transfer Equity common units through April 27, 2012, which generated gains totaling $41.3 million. All activities included in our former sixth reportable business segment, Other Investments, ceased on January 18, 2012, which was the date we discontinued using the equity method to account for our investment in Energy Transfer Equity. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our business segments. Income taxes. Provision for income taxes was $57.5 million in 2013, which primarily reflects our state tax obligations under the Texas Margin Tax. However, we recognized an overall income tax benefit of $17.2 million for 2012, which was primarily due to a $45.3 million federal income tax benefit related to the conversion of certain of our subsidiaries to limited liability companies during the first quarter of 2012, partially offset by amounts recorded in connection with the Texas Margin Tax. For additional information regarding our provision for income taxes, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Business Segment Highlights We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. The following table presents gross operating margin by segment for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 NGL Pipelines & Services $ 2,877.7 $ 2,514.4 $ 2,468.5 Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 803.3 789.0 775.5 Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services 762.5 742.7 387.7 Offshore Pipeline & Services 162.0 146.1 173.0 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services 681.0 625.9 579.9 Other (1) -- -- 2.4 Total $ 5,286.5 $ 4,818.1 $ 4,387.0 (1) Represents the equity earnings we recorded from our previously held investment in Energy Transfer Equity. Our reporting for this segment ceased on January 18, 2012 when we stopped using the equity method to account for this investment. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding the liquidation of our investment in Energy Transfer Equity. For additional information regarding our use of this non-GAAP financial measure, see ""Other Items – Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" within this Part II, Item 7. We include equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin and operating income. The following information highlights significant changes in our year-to-year segment results (i.e., gross operating margin amounts) and the primary drivers of such changes. The selected volume statistics presented in the tabular information for each segment are reported on a net basis, taking into account our ownership interests in certain joint ventures, and reflect the periods in which we owned an interest in such operations. These statistics reflect volumes for newly constructed assets from the dates such assets were placed into service. 87 Table of Contents NGL Pipelines & Services. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Segment gross operating margin: Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities $ 1,162.0 $ 1,165.4 $ 1,443.0 NGL pipelines and related storage 1,145.7 900.0 740.7 NGL fractionation 570.0 449.0 284.8 Total $ 2,877.7 $ 2,514.4 $ 2,468.5 Selected volumetric data: NGL transportation volumes (MBPD) 2,892 2,787 2,472 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 824 726 659 Equity NGL production (MBPD) (1) 116 126 101 Fee-based natural gas processing (MMcf/d) (2) 4,786 4,612 4,382 (1) The increase in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to equity NGL volumes produced at our Yoakum facility in South Texas. (2) Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our gas plants. The increase in fee-based processing volumes in 2013 from 2012 is primarily due to (i) the start-up of our Yoakum gas plant in May 2012 and (ii) changes in processing agreements whereby producers are electing to process more of their natural gas on a fee basis in order to retain NGLs extracted from their natural gas streams, which, in turn, also lowers our equity NGL production. Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities Comparison of 2014 with 2013. Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2014 decreased $3.4 million when compared to 2013. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities for 2014 decreased a net $28.4 million when compared to 2013 primarily due to lower sales margins, which accounted for a $52.9 million decrease, partially offset by a $23.4 million increase due to higher sales volumes, especially for fully-refrigerated, low-ethane propane volumes at our Houston Ship Channel LPG export dock. LPG exports continue to benefit from increased NGL supplies produced from domestic shale plays such as the Eagle Ford Shale and international demand for propane as a feedstock in ethylene plant operations and for power generation and heating purposes. Gross operating margin from our Pioneer natural gas processing plant increased a net $35.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher equity NGL production volumes of 6 MBPD, which accounted for a $42.4 million increase, partially offset by lower processing margins, which accounted for a $12.6 million decrease. Gross operating margin from our South Texas natural gas processing plants increased a net $49.9 million year-to-year primarily due to (i) higher processing fees, which accounted for a $24.8 million increase, (ii) higher fee-based processing volumes of 162 MMcf/d, which accounted for a $13.4 million increase and (iii) higher processing margins, which accounted for a $25.2 million increase. Equity NGL production volumes at our South Texas natural gas processing plants decreased 9 MBPD year-to-year, which resulted in a $14.5 million decrease in gross operating margin. Gross operating margin from our Meeker natural gas processing plant decreased a net $38.0 million year-to-year primarily due to (i) lower processing margins, which accounted for a $19.8 million decrease, (ii) lower equity NGL production volumes of 15 MBPD, which accounted for a $21.9 million decrease, (iii) lower fee based processing volumes of 160 MMcf/d, which accounted for a $9.9 million decrease, partially offset by (iii) higher processing fees, which accounted for a $12.3 million increase. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants in southern Louisiana decreased a net $14.3 million year-to-year primarily due (i) to lower processing margins, which accounted for a $23.6 million decrease, and (ii) lower processing fees, which accounted for a $6.9 million decrease, partially offset by (iii) higher equity NGL production of 7 MBPD, which accounted for an $18.4 million increase. Gross operating margin from our Chaco gas plant decreased $12.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower processing margins, which accounted for a $5.7 million decrease, and higher operating expenses of $8.4 million associated with plant maintenance projects. 88 Table of Contents Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2013 decreased $277.6 million when compared to 2012. Gross operating margin from our Meeker natural gas processing plant in Colorado decreased $182.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower processing margins in 2013. Gross operating margin from our Pioneer natural gas processing plant in Wyoming decreased $81.3 million year-to-year primarily due to the effects of ethane rejection and general production declines, both of which lowered equity NGL production volumes at this facility during 2013 when compared to 2012. Gross operating margin from our South Texas natural gas processing plants increased a net $15.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher volumes, which accounted for a $54.3 million increase, and higher processing fees, which resulted in a $28.6 million increase, partially offset by lower processing margins, which accounted for a $65.3 million decrease. Results from our South Texas natural gas processing plants benefited from the start-up of our Yoakum, Texas gas plant. The first phase (or ""train"") of this plant commenced operations in May 2012. We placed the second and third trains at the Yoakum plant in service in August 2012 and March 2013, respectively. Gross operating margin from our remaining natural gas processing plants decreased a combined $40.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower processing margins in 2013. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities for 2013 increased a net $44.3 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $131.0 million increase, partially offset by lower sales margins, which accounted for an $87.0 million decrease. Comparability between 2013 and 2012 gross operating margin amounts was also impacted by a $20.0 million gain related to proceeds received in a vendor settlement and a $13.7 million gain attributable to changes in a provision for certain gas plant capacity obligations, both of which were recorded in 2012. NGL pipelines and related storage Comparison of 2014 with 2013. Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and related storage assets for 2014 increased $245.7 million when compared to 2013. Our ATEX pipeline, which commenced operations in January 2014, contributed $135.6 million of gross operating margin in 2014 and 53 MBPD of transportation volumes. ATEX transports ethane primarily southbound from NGL fractionation plants located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to our Mont Belvieu storage complex. The ethane extracted by these fractionation facilities originates from the Marcellus and Utica Shale production areas. Gross operating margin for ATEX for 2014 includes $55.2 million of transportation revenues associated with shipper make-up rights that are deferred under GAAP and not reflected in our consolidated revenues. For additional information regarding the inclusion of deferred revenues in gross operating margin, see ""Other Items – Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures – Gross Operating Margin"" within this Part II, Item 7. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related NGL terminals increased a net $50.5 million year-to-year. The increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to a $103.9 million increase in transportation revenues attributable to the Rocky Mountain pipeline expansion and higher system-wide tariffs, partially offset by a $27.2 million increase in operating costs (e.g., higher fuel and maintenance costs) and a $26.2 million decrease in revenues attributable to a 47 MBPD decline in transportation volumes. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System increased $18.0 million year-to-year primarily due to a 35 MBPD increase in transportation volumes primarily associated with Eagle Ford Shale production. Collectively, gross operating margin from our investments in the Front Range Pipeline, Texas Express Pipeline and Texas Express Gathering System increased $23.9 million year-to-year. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin from these investments includes $7.4 million of transportation revenues associated with shipper make-up rights that are deferred under GAAP and not reflected in our consolidated equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Net to our interest, aggregate transportation volumes on these three pipeline systems were 60 MBPD in 2014. The Front Range Pipeline, which commenced operations in February 2014, transports mixed NGLs from natural gas processing plants located in the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Colorado to an interconnect with our Texas Express Pipeline and Mid-America Pipeline System at Skellytown, Texas. The Texas Express Pipeline extends from Skellytown, Texas to our NGL fractionation and storage complex at Mont Belvieu, Texas. The Texas Express Gathering System is comprised of two NGL gathering systems that deliver volumes to the Texas Express 89 Table of Contents Pipeline. The Texas Express Pipeline and Texas Express Gathering System both commenced operations in November 2013. Gross operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2014 includes $19.3 million from Oiltanking attributable to fees it charges Enterprise for use of Oiltanking's Houston Ship Channel docks and related infrastructure to load and unload NGLs. Enterprise's Houston Ship Channel LPG export and NGL import marine terminal are located on land owned by Oiltanking at its Jacintoport facility. Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and related storage assets for 2013 increased $159.3 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to strong results from our South Texas and Houston region NGL assets and the Dixie Pipeline. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System increased $66.6 million year-to-year primarily due to a 126 MBPD increase in transportation volumes associated with Eagle Ford Shale production. Gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel LPG export terminal and related Channel Pipeline increased a combined $50.0 million year-to-year primarily due to increased volumes. In March 2013, we completed an expansion project at this terminal that increased its loading capability for fully refrigerated, low-ethane propane from 4.0 MMBbls per month to 7.5 MMBbls per month. Loading volumes at our Houston Ship Channel LPG export terminal increased 99 MBPD year-to-year and volumes transported on the related Channel Pipeline increased 108 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Dixie Pipeline and related NGL terminals increased $18.2 million year-to-year primarily due to a 27 MBPD increase in transportation volumes for 2013, which accounted for $10.7 million of the increase after taking into account associated operating costs, and higher transportation and other fees, which accounted for $7.5 million of the increase. Transportation volumes on the Dixie Pipeline were negatively impacted during 2012 due to downtime associated with pipeline integrity projects and warmer than normal winter weather. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related NGL terminals increased a net $7.2 million year-to-year. A $43.2 million increase in revenues associated with higher system-wide tariffs and other fees, combined with a $4.3 million decrease in operating costs primarily due to pipeline gains during 2013, was partially offset by a $40.3 million decrease in gross operating margin attributable to lower transportation volumes. Transportation volumes for our Mid-America Pipeline System and Seminole Pipeline decreased a combined 75 MBPD year-to-year primarily due to lower NGL production from Rocky Mountain natural gas processing plants caused by ethane rejection and reduced demand for NGL transportation services between Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas. NGL fractionation Comparison of 2014 with 2013. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2014 increased $121.0 million when compared to 2013 primarily due to higher fractionation volumes and fees at our Mont Belvieu complex. NGL fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex increased 108 MBPD year-to-year (net to our ownership interest), which resulted in a $113.2 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin after taking into account associated operating costs. Higher average fractionation and other fees at our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators accounted for an additional $22.8 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin. Our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators continue to benefit from increased mixed NGL volumes sourced from domestic shale plays such as the Eagle Ford and other producing regions such as the Rocky Mountains. Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2013 increased $164.2 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to higher fractionation fees and volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex. Higher average fractionation and other fees during 2013 attributable to our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators accounted for an $82.4 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin. Also, NGL fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex increased 97 MBPD year-to-year (net to our ownership interest), which resulted in a $61.1 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin after taking into account associated operating costs. NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex increased 170 MBPD year-to-year as a result of placing our seventh and eighth NGL fractionation units into service in the third and fourth quarters of 2013, respectively. 90 Table of Contents Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services.

Gross operating margin from our onshore crude oil pipelines and services segment for 2014 increased $19.8 million when compared to 2013. Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related activities decreased $161.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins attributable to decreases in regional price spreads for crude oil. For example, the average indicative price spread between LLS and WTI crude oil was $9.37 per barrel in 2013 compared to $3.74 per barrel in 2014. Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System and West Texas System increased a combined $77.6 million year-to-year primarily due to a combined 58 MBPD increase in transportation volumes. Equity earnings from our investment in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System, which commenced operations in the second quarter of 2013, increased $28.2 million year-to-year on a 52 MBPD increase in transportation volumes (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our investment in the Seaway Pipeline increased $30.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average tariffs and other fees in 2014, including $9.0 million of capacity fees associated with the commencement of operations on the Seaway Loop in December 2014. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin from this investment includes $16.7 million of transportation revenues associated with shipper make-up rights that are deferred under GAAP and not reflected in our consolidated equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Seaway's transportation volumes decreased a net 18 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest), with a 42 MBPD decrease in short-haul volumes on the Texas City System partially offset by a 25 MBPD increase on the Freeport System. Gross operating margin from our ECHO storage terminal increased $17.9 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in net measurement gains of $8.9 million in 2014 when compared to 2013 and higher storage volumes, which accounted for an $8.6 million increase. Gross operating margin from crude oil and related operations at Oiltanking's Houston Ship Channel terminal was $35.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our onshore crude oil pipelines and services business for 2013 increased $355.0 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to higher volumes on our crude oil pipeline systems and improved results from our crude oil marketing activities. Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System increased $192.3 million year-to-year primarily due to a 107 MBPD increase in volumes on the Eagle Ford Expansion pipeline. Gross operating margin from our investments in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System and Seaway Pipeline increased a combined $110.6 million year-to-year primarily due to an aggregate 193 MBPD increase in transportation volumes (net to our interest) on these pipelines. We placed the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System into service in July 2013. Results for Seaway benefited from the completion of pump station additions and modifications at its Cushing origin in January 2013. Lastly, gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related activities increased $30.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes. 92 Table of Contents Offshore Pipelines & Services.

Due to the high cost of third party windstorm insurance coverage for our offshore Gulf of Mexico assets, we have self-insured these operations since June 2012. As a result, insurance expense for this segment in 2013 decreased $6.5 million when compared to 2012. For a discussion of insurance-related matters, see ""Other Items – Insurance Matters"" within this Part II, Item 7. 93 Table of Contents Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Petrochemical & Refined Products Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Segment gross operating margin: Propylene fractionation and related activities $ 227.4 $ 134.7 $ 193.1 Butane isomerization and related operations 75.3 99.2 95.8 Octane enhancement and related plant operations 122.4 154.7 100.9 Refined products pipelines and related activities 186.7 164.6 89.9 Marine transportation and other 69.2 72.7 100.2 Total $ 681.0 $ 625.9 $ 579.9 Selected volumetric data: Propylene fractionation volumes (MBPD) 75 74 72 Butane isomerization volumes (MBPD) 93 94 95 Standalone DIB processing volumes (MBPD) 82 67 46 Octane additive and related plant production volumes (MBPD) 17 20 16 Transportation volumes, primarily refined products and petrochemicals (MBPD) 802 702 689 Propylene fractionation and related activities Comparison of 2014 with 2013. Gross operating margin from our propylene fractionation and related activities increased $92.7 million for 2014 when compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to (i) higher propylene sales margins, which accounted for a $55.0 million increase, (ii) higher propylene sales volumes, which accounted for an $8.8 million increase, (iii) an $11.4 million increase in propylene fractionation fee revenues and (iv) lower operating expenses of $13.1 million at our Mont Belvieu propylene fractionators primarily due to rescheduling of certain maintenance activities to the second quarter of 2015. Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our propylene fractionation and related activities for 2013 decreased $58.4 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to lower propylene sales margins in 2013, which accounted for a $62.7 million decrease, partially offset by higher transportation fees on North Dean Pipeline, which accounted for a $6.2 million increase. Butane isomerization and deisobutanizer operations Comparison of 2014 with 2013. Gross operating margin from our butane isomerization and deisobutanizer (""DIB"") operations decreased an aggregate $23.9 million for 2014 when compared to 2013. The year-to-year decrease is primarily due to higher maintenance costs incurred during 2014, which accounted for a $14.4 million decrease, and lower by-product sales revenues primarily due to lower commodity prices, which accounted for an $11.5 million decrease. Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from these operations increased an aggregate $3.4 million for 2013 when compared to 2012 primarily due to the addition of a new standalone DIB unit at our Mont Belvieu facility in March 2013, which accounted for $5.6 million of gross operating margin for the year and 27 MBPD of additional processing volumes. Octane enhancement and HPIB plant operations Comparison of 2014 with 2013. Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement facility and high purity isobutylene (""HPIB"") plant decreased a net $32.3 million for 2014 when compared to 2013. The year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is primarily due to an extended period of unscheduled maintenance at the octane enhancement facility during the first quarter of 2014 and reduced operating rates for the remainder of 2014. Production volumes at our octane enhancement facility averaged 15 MBPD in 2014 compared to 18 MBPD in 2013. 94 Table of Contents Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement and HPIB plant operations increased a combined $53.8 million for 2013 when compared to 2012. Our octane enhancement facility experienced extended periods of downtime for maintenance during 2012, which negatively impacted the facility's operating results for that year. The $53.8 million increase in gross operating margin for 2013 is primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $40.0 million increase, and higher sales margins, which accounted for a $29.0 million increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for a $16.8 million decrease. Refined products pipelines and related activities Comparison of 2014 with 2013. Gross operating margin from our refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2014 increased $22.1 million when compared to 2013. Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline and related refined products terminals increased $6.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower pipeline integrity and other maintenance expenses of $13.1 million and higher transportation tariffs and other fees of $12.2 million, partially offset by a $16.6 million benefit recorded in 2013 related to reductions in a provision for future pipeline capacity obligations on a third party pipeline. Overall, transportation volumes for the TE Products Pipeline increased a net 48 MBPD year-to-year primarily due to higher intrastate shipments of petrochemicals and refined products in southeast Texas, which accounted for a combined 64 MBPD increase, partially offset by lower interstate transportation volumes for refined products and NGLs of 16 MBPD. Interstate components of the TE Products Pipeline were removed from service during 2013 and repurposed to accommodate the southbound delivery of ethane on our ATEX pipeline, which commenced operations in January 2014. Equity earnings from our investment in Centennial Pipeline LLC (""Centennial"") increased $9.3 million year-to-year primarily due to Centennial's recognition in 2014 of previously deferred revenues. Gross operating margin from our refined products marketing activities decreased $10.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins. In May 2014, we commenced loading operations at our Beaumont Refined Products Export Terminal, which is located on the Neches River in Southeast Texas and can load cargoes of refined products at rates up to 15,000 barrels per hour. Gross operating margin from this export terminal was $8.9 million for 2014. Gross operating margin from our Beaumont West Terminal was $7.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2013 increased $74.7 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to improved results from our TE Products Pipeline and refined products terminals and related marketing activities. Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline increased a net $24.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation fees, which accounted for a $52.3 million increase, partially offset by a $28.0 million decrease in gross operating margin attributable to lower refined products interstate transportation volumes. The higher transportation fees year-to-year include a $24.3 million benefit recognized in connection with the settlement of a rate case with certain shippers during the second quarter of 2013. Gross operating margin from our refined products terminals increased $27.8 million year-to-year primarily due to a $16.6 million benefit attributable to reductions in a provision for future pipeline capacity obligations recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Results from our refined products marketing activities increased $21.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales margins, which accounted for a $15.7 million increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $6.1 million increase. Marine transportation and other Comparison of 2014 with 2013. Gross operating margin from our marine transportation and other segment services for 2014 decreased $3.5 million when compared to 2013 primarily due to higher operating expenses. Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our marine transportation and other segment services for 2013 decreased $27.5 million when compared to 2012. Results attributable to our marine transportation business for 2012 included a $24.0 million gain recorded in connection with a legal settlement. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2014, we had $4.17 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $74.4 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $4.09 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO's revolving credit 95 Table of Contents facilities. Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. We expect to issue additional equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital spending. We have a universal shelf registration statement (the ""2013 Shelf"") on file with the SEC. The 2013 Shelf allows Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and EPO (on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. We also have a registration statement on file with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $1.25 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings. Pursuant to this ""at-the-market"" program, we may sell common units under an equity distribution agreement between Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and certain broker-dealers from time-to-time by means of ordinary brokers' transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement. After taking into account the aggregate sale price of common units sold under our at-the-market program through February 1, 2015, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under this program up to an aggregate sales price of $1.17 billion. Consolidated Debt The following table presents scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2014 for the years indicated (dollars in millions): Scheduled Maturities of Debt Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Commercial Paper $ 906.5 $ 906.5 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- Senior Notes 18,950.0 1,300.0 750.0 800.0 350.0 1,500.0 14,250.0 Junior Subordinated Notes 1,532.7 -- -- -- -- -- 1,532.7 Total $ 21,389.2 $ 2,206.5 $ 750.0 $ 800.0 $ 350.0 $ 1,500.0 $ 15,782.7 We expect to refinance the current maturities of our consolidated debt obligations at or prior to their maturity. The following information describes significant transactions that affected our consolidated debt obligations during the year ended December 31, 2014: Senior Notes Transactions. In February 2014, EPO issued $850 million in principal amount of 3.90% senior notes due February 2024 (""Senior Notes JJ"") and $1.15 billion in principal amount of 5.10% senior notes due February 2045 (""Senior Notes KK""). Net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes JJ and KK were used to repay debt, including amounts then outstanding under EPO's commercial paper program (which EPO used to repay $500 million in principal amount of Senior Notes O that matured in January 2014), and for general company purposes. In October 2014, EPO issued $800 million in principal amount of 2.55% senior notes due October 2019 (""Senior Notes LL""), $1.15 billion in principal amount of 3.75% senior notes due February 2025 (""Senior Notes MM"") and $400 million in principal amount of 4.95% senior notes due October 2054 (""Senior Notes NN""). EPO also issued an additional $400 million in principal amount of its 4.85% Senior Notes II due March 2044. Net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes were used as follows: (i) to repay debt principal amounts outstanding under EPO's $1.5 Billion 364-Day Credit Agreement (as discussed below) and commercial paper program (both of which were used to partially fund the cash consideration paid in Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition (see ""Significant Recent Developments"" within this Part II, Item 7)), (ii) to repay $650 million in principal amount of Senior Notes G that matured in October 2014, and (iii) for general company purposes. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has unconditionally guaranteed these senior notes on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis. These senior notes rank equal with EPO's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and are senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of EPO. These senior notes are subject to make-whole redemption rights and were issued under indentures containing certain covenants, which generally restrict EPO's ability (with certain exceptions) to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. 96 Table of Contents $1.5 Billion 364-Day Credit Agreement. In September 2014, EPO entered into a new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement (the ""$1.5 Billion 364-Day Credit Agreement""). Under the terms of the $1.5 Billion 364-Day Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $1.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $200 million to $1.7 billion at EPO's election) at a variable interest rate for a term of 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. On October 1, 2014, we borrowed $1.5 billion under this agreement to partially fund the cash consideration paid under Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition (see Note 10). As noted previously, this amount was subsequently repaid using proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in October 2014. To the extent that principal amounts are outstanding, EPO's obligations under the $1.5 Billion 364-Day Credit Agreement are not secured by any collateral; however, they are guaranteed by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Any amounts borrowed under the $1.5 Billion 364-Day Credit Agreement mature on September 29, 2015, although EPO may, between 15 and 60 days prior to the maturity date, elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as non-revolving term loans for a period of one additional year, payable on September 29, 2016. The $1.5 Billion 364-Day Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants (affirmative and negative) and events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity date of any amounts borrowed under the $1.5 Billion 364-Day Credit Agreement. The $1.5 Billion 364-Day Credit Agreement also restricts EPO's ability to pay cash distributions to its parent, Enterprise Products Partners L.P., if a default or an event of default (as defined in the $1.5 Billion 364-Day Credit Agreement) has occurred and is continuing at the time such distribution is scheduled to be paid or would result therefrom. Issuance of Common Units The following table summarizes the issuance of Enterprise common units during the years indicated in connection with underwritten equity offerings, the at-the-market program, and quarterly DRIP and employee unit purchase plan (""EUPP"") (dollars in millions, number of units issued as shown): Number of Common Units Issued Net Cash Proceeds Received Year Ended December 31, 2012: Common units issued in connection with underwritten offering 18,400,000 $ 473.3 Common units issued in connection with at-the-market program (1) 7,957,090 203.8 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 5,629,320 139.7 Total 31,986,410 $ 816.8 Year Ended December 31, 2013: Common units issued in connection with underwritten offerings 36,800,000 $ 1,039.6 Common units issued in connection with at-the-market program 15,249,378 456.3 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 10,308,254 296.1 Total 62,357,632 $ 1,792.0 Year Ended December 31, 2014: Common units issued in connection with at-the-market program 1,590,334 $ 57.7 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 9,754,227 331.1 Total 11,344,561 $ 388.8 (1) The sale of common units under the at-the-market program was initiated during the third quarter of 2012. On October 1, 2014, in order to fund the equity consideration paid in Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition, we issued 54,807,352 common units to OTA. Pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement, we granted OTA registration rights with respect to these common units. On February 13, 2015, we issued an additional 36,827,557 common units to the public unitholders of Oiltanking as a result of completing the Oiltanking Merger. See ""Significant Recent Developments"" within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information regarding the acquisition of Oiltanking. 97 Table of Contents The following information describes significant transactions that affected our partners' equity accounts during the year ended December 31, 2014: At-the-market program. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we issued 1,590,334 common units under this program for aggregate gross proceeds of $58.3 million. After taking into account applicable costs, these transactions resulted in net cash proceeds of $57.7 million. DRIP and EUPP. We also have registration statements on file with the SEC collectively authorizing the issuance of up to 140,000,000 of our common units in connection with our DRIP. The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional new common units. We issued a total of 9,480,407 common units under our DRIP during 2014, which generated net cash proceeds of $321.3 million. Affiliates of privately held EPCO reinvested $100.0 million under the DRIP in 2014, resulting in the issuance of 2,946,241 common units (this amount being a component of the total common units issued under the DRIP in 2014). After taking into account the number of common units issued under the DRIP through December 31, 2014, we have the capacity to issue an additional 27,481,349 common units under this plan. In addition to the DRIP, we have registration statements on file with the SEC authorizing the issuance of up to 8,000,000 of our common units in connection with our EUPP. We issued 273,820 common units under our EUPP during 2014, which generated net cash proceeds of $9.8 million. After taking into account the number of common units issued under the EUPP through December 31, 2014, we may issue an additional 7,153,068 common units under this plan. Use of proceeds. The net cash proceeds we received from the issuance of common units during 2014 were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under EPO's commercial paper program and for general company purposes. For additional information regarding our issuance of common units and related registration statements, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Two-for-One Split of Limited Partner Units In July 2014, we announced that our general partner approved a two-for-one split of our common units. The common unit split was completed on August 21, 2014 by distributing one additional common unit for each common unit outstanding (to holders of record as of the close of business on August 14, 2014). All per unit amounts and number of Enterprise units outstanding in this annual report are presented on a post-split basis. Credit Ratings As of March 2, 2015, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO's long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO's short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor's and P-2 from Moody's. Fitch Ratings issued non-solicited ratings of BBB+ and F-2 for EPO's long-term senior unsecured debt securities and short-term senior unsecured debt securities, respectively. EPO's credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. Designated Units Issued in Connection with Holdings Merger In November 2010, we completed the merger of Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries (the ""Holdings Merger""). In connection with the Holdings Merger, a privately held affiliate of EPCO agreed to temporarily waive the regular quarterly cash distributions it would otherwise receive from us with 98 Table of Contents respect to a certain number of our common units it owns (the ""Designated Units""). Distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2014 excluded 45,120,000 Designated Units. Distributions to be paid, if any, during the year ended December 31, 2015 will exclude 35,380,000 Designated Units, respectively. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 4,162.2 $ 3,865.5 $ 2,890.9 Cash used in investing activities $ 5,797.9 $ 4,257.5 $ 3,018.8 Cash provided by financing activities $ 1,653.2 $ 432.8 $ 124.2 Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. As a result, these cash flows are exposed to certain risks. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry. We provide products and services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals. The products that we process, sell, transport or store are principally used as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating; as feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing; by crude oil refineries; and in the production of motor gasoline. Reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers, whether because of a decline in general economic conditions, reduced demand for the end products made with our products, or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons, could have a negative impact on our earnings and operating cash flows. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts: Comparison of 2014 with 2013 Operating Activities. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $296.7 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: § a $183.8 million increase in cash attributable to higher partnership income in 2014 compared to 2013 (after adjusting our $226.4 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); and § a $123.5 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to increased earnings from our investments in crude oil and NGL pipeline joint ventures (e.g., our Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System, Texas Express Pipeline, Seaway Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline). For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see ""Results of Operations"" within this Part II, Item 7. Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $1.54 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to: § a net $2.42 billion cash outflow in October 2014 in connection with Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition (see ""Significant Recent Developments – Acquisition of Oiltanking Partners, L.P."" under this Part II, Item 7); and 99 Table of Contents § an aggregate $135.3 million year-to-year decrease in cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries (see Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries); partially offset by § a $518.2 million year-to-year decrease in capital expenditures for consolidated property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs (see ""Capital Spending"" within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information regarding our capital spending program); § a $371.7 million year-to-year decrease in cash contributions to our unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to the completion of construction of the Texas Express Pipeline, SEKCO Oil Pipeline, Front Range Pipeline and Seaway Pipeline looping project, partially offset by increased investments in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System; and § a $126.9 million year-to-year change in restricted cash requirements. Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $1.22 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to: § a $2.85 billion year-to-year increase in net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements. EPO issued $4.75 billion and repaid $1.15 billion in principal amount of senior notes in 2014, compared to the issuance of $2.25 billion and repayment of $1.2 billion in principal amount of senior notes in 2013. In addition, net cash inflows attributable to the issuance of short-term notes under EPO's commercial paper program and net borrowings under EPO's revolving credit facilities increased an aggregate of $303.4 million year-to-year; and § a $196.4 million year-to-year change related to the monetization of interest rate derivative instruments. A $27.6 million gain was recorded in 2014 compared to a $168.8 million loss in 2013; partially offset by § a $1.4 billion year-to-year decrease in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units. We issued an aggregate 11,344,561 common units in connection with our DRIP, EUPP and at-the-market program in 2014, which generated $388.8 million of net cash proceeds. This compares to an aggregate 62,357,632 common units we issued in connection with an underwritten offering and our DRIP, EUPP and at-the-market program in 2013, which collectively generated $1.79 billion of net cash proceeds; § a $237.8 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners in 2014 when compared to 2013. The increase in cash distributions is due to increases in both the number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the quarterly cash distribution rates per unit; and § a $111.4 million year-to-year decrease in cash contributions from noncontrolling interests primarily due to contributions we received during 2013 related to a joint venture involving NGL fractionators at our complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Comparison of 2013 with 2012 Operating Activities. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $974.6 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: § a $354.8 million increase in cash attributable to higher partnership income in 2013 compared to 2012 (after adjusting our $179.1 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); § a $484.9 million year-to-year increase in cash attributable to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to operations; and 100 Table of Contents § a $134.9 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates for 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to improved results from our investments in crude oil pipeline joint ventures. Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $1.24 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to: § an aggregate $918.2 million year-to-year decrease in cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries. Proceeds for 2012 included the $1.1 billion we received in connection with sales of common units of Energy Transfer Equity; and § a $484.6 million year-to-year increase in cash contributions to our unconsolidated affiliates for 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to expansion capital expenditures for the Seaway Pipeline, Texas Express Pipeline, Front Range Pipeline and Eagle Ford Pipeline joint ventures; partially offset by § a $216.3 million year-to-year decrease in capital expenditures for consolidated property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs. Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $308.6 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to: § a $975.2 million year-to-year increase in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units in 2013 when compared to 2012. We issued an aggregate of 62,357,632 common units in connection with two underwritten offerings, our at-the-market program and DRIP and EUPP during 2013, which collectively generated $1.79 billion of net cash proceeds. This compares to an aggregate 31,986,410 common units we issued in connection with an underwritten offering, our at-the-market program and DRIP and EUPP during 2012, which collectively generated $816.8 million of net cash proceeds; § a $108.8 million year-to-year increase in cash contributions from noncontrolling interests primarily due to contributions we received during 2013 related to a joint venture involving NGL fractionators at our complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas; partially offset by § a $514.5 million year-to-year decrease in net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements. EPO issued $2.25 billion and repaid $1.2 billion in principal amount of senior notes during 2013, compared to the issuance of $2.5 billion and repayment of $1.0 billion in principal amount of senior notes during 2012. In addition, net cash inflows attributable to the issuance of short-term notes under EPO's commercial paper program were $127.2 million for 2013 compared to $346.4 million for 2012. Lastly, net repayments under EPO's $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility were $150.0 million for 2012; and § a $221.7 million increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners in 2013 when compared to 2012 due to increases in both the number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the quarterly cash distribution rates per unit. 101 Table of Contents Cash Distributions to Limited Partners Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business including, for example, those for capital expenditures, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, commitments and contingencies and other significant amounts. The retention of cash by the partnership allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets. Based on the level of available cash, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board of Directors of Enterprise GP, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Unlike most master limited partnerships, our general partner has a non-economic ownership interest in us and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from us based on incentive distribution rights or other equity interests. We measure available cash by reference to distributable cash flow. The following table summarizes our calculation of distributable cash flow for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Net income attributable to limited partners (1) $ 2,787.4 $ 2,596.9 $ 2,419.9 Adjustments to GAAP net income attributable to limited partners to derive non-GAAP distributable cash flow: Add depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 1,360.5 1,217.6 1,104.9 Add asset impairment charges 34.0 92.6 63.4 Subtract net gains attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries (102.1 ) (83.3 ) (86.4 ) Add cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries (2) 145.3 280.6 1,198.8 Add cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates (3) 375.1 251.6 116.7 Subtract equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates (3) (259.5 ) (167.3 ) (64.3 ) Subtract sustaining capital expenditures (4) (369.0 ) (291.7 ) (366.2 ) Add gains or subtract losses from monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges (5) 27.6 (168.8 ) (147.8 ) Add deferred income tax expense or subtract benefit, as applicable 6.1 37.9 (66.2 ) Other, net 73.2 (15.7 ) (39.5 ) Distributable cash flow $ 4,078.6 $ 3,750.4 $ 4,133.3 Total cash distributions paid to limited partners with respect to period $ 2,707.6 $ 2,461.9 $ 2,225.8 Cumulative quarterly cash distributions per unit declared by Enterprise GP with respect to period (6) $ 1.4500 $ 1.3700 $ 1.2863 Total distributable cash flow retained by partnership with respect to period (7) $ 1,371.0 $ 1,288.5 $ 1,907.5 Distribution coverage ratio (8) 1.51x 1.52x 1.86x (1) For a discussion of significant changes in our comparative income statement amounts underlying net income attributable to limited partners, along with the primary drivers of such changes, see ""Consolidated Income Statements Highlights"" within this Part II, Item 7.

(6) See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to the periods presented. (7) At the sole discretion of Enterprise GP, cash retained by the partnership with respect to each of these years was primarily reinvested in our growth capital spending program, which substantially reduced our reliance on the equity and debt capital markets to fund such major expenditures. (8) Distribution coverage ratio determined by dividing distributable cash flow by total cash distributions paid to limited partners and in connection with distribution equivalent rights with respect to the period. 102 Table of Contents For additional information regarding non-GAAP distributable cash flow, see ""Other Items – Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" within this Part II, Item 7. Our use of distributable cash flow for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure. Capital Spending An important part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are positioned to continue to expand our system of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production resulting from development activities in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, Northeast and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, including the Niobrara, Barnett, Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville, Marcellus and Utica Shale plays and deepwater Gulf of Mexico production fields. Although our focus in recent years has been on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, asset acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. In light of current business conditions, we expect that these opportunities will increase. We placed approximately $4.1 billion of major capital projects into service during 2014. These projects included the ATEX, Rocky Mountain expansion of our Mid-America Pipeline System, Front Range Pipeline and Seaway Pipeline looping project. We expect to complete construction and begin commercial operations of growth capital projects costing approximately $2.6 billion in 2015. These projects include various product handling projects (e.g., natural gasoline treating and degassing) at our Mont Belvieu complex. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $1.3 billion in purchase commitments outstanding that relate to our capital spending for property, plant and equipment. These commitments primarily relate to construction projects in Texas. The following table summarizes our capital spending for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Step 1 of Oiltanking acquisition (1) Cash, net of $21.5 million at Oiltanking $ 2,416.8 Equity instruments (54,807,352 common units of Enterprise) 2,171.5 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net: (2) Growth capital projects (3) 2,502.8 $ 3,088.0 $ 3,232.7 Sustaining capital projects (4) 361.2 294.2 365.8 Investments in unconsolidated affiliates 722.4 1,094.1 609.5 Other investing activities 5.8 1.0 43.1 Total capital spending $ 8,180.5 $ 4,477.3 $ 4,251.1 (1) For a description of the acquisition of Oiltanking, see ""Significant Recent Developments"" within this Part II, Item 7. (2) On certain of our capital projects, third parties are obligated to reimburse us for all or a portion of project expenditures. The majority of such arrangements are associated with pipeline construction projects and production well tie-ins. Contributions in aid of construction costs were $28.9 million, $26.0 million and $23.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented net of related contributions in aid of construction costs. (3) Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. (4) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. Fluctuations in our capital spending for growth capital projects and investments in unconsolidated affiliates are explained in large part by increases or decreases in spending on our major growth capital projects. Fluctuations in our capital spending for sustaining capital projects are explained in large part by the timing and cost of pipeline integrity and similar projects. Our most significant growth capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 103 Table of Contents 2014 involved projects at our Mont Belvieu complex, to expand joint venture crude oil pipelines, for the ATEX and Aegis ethane pipelines and for our LPG, ethane and refined products export terminals. Comparison of 2014 with 2013. On October 1, 2014, we acquired the general partner and related incentive distribution rights, 15,899,802 common units and 38,899,802 subordinated units of Oiltanking from OTA. We paid total consideration of approximately $4.4 billion to OTA comprised of $2.21 billion in cash and 54,807,352 Enterprise common units for these ownership interests and rights. We also paid $228.3 million to acquire from OTA outstanding loans payable by Oiltanking or its subsidiaries. Collectively, these transactions are referred to as ""Step 1"" of the Oiltanking acquisition. Oiltanking owns marine terminals located on the Houston Ship Channel and at the Port of Beaumont with a total of 12 ship and barge docks and approximately 26 MMBbls of crude oil and petroleum products storage capacity. Oiltanking's marine terminal on the Houston Ship Channel is connected by pipeline to our Mont Belvieu, Texas complex and is integral to our growing LPG export, crude oil storage and octane enhancement and propylene businesses. Our ECHO facility is also connected to Oiltanking's system. For additional information regarding the acquisition of Oiltanking, see ""Significant Recent Developments"" within this Part II, Item 7. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment in 2014 decreased $518.2 million when compared to 2013 primarily due to lower growth capital expenditures of $585.2 million year-to-year, which was partially offset by an increase in sustaining capital expenditures of $67.0 million year-to-year, largely attributable to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity and similar projects. Capital spending for growth projects in the Eagle Ford Shale and at our Mont Belvieu complex decreased a combined $408.3 million year-to-year. Since 2010, expansion of midstream infrastructure in the Eagle Ford Shale region has been a key strategic focus for us. We constructed new NGL, natural gas and crude oil pipelines and the Yoakum natural gas processing plant to facilitate production growth from Eagle Ford Shale producers. Our build-out in this supply basin was substantially complete in 2013. Likewise, we completed and placed into service the seventh and eight NGL fractionators at our Mont Belvieu complex in September 2013 and November 2013, respectively. Growth capital spending for our ATEX and Aegis ethane pipelines decreased a net $554.1 million year-to-year. Our ATEX pipeline was placed into service in January 2014. Construction on the initial phase of Aegis was completed in September 2014 with full operations expected to commence by the end of 2015. Growth capital spending for our LPG, ethane and refined products export facilities increased $324.1 million year-to-year. The announced expansions of our LPG export terminal located on the Houston Ship Channel are expected to increase its ability to load cargoes from 7.5 MMBbls per month to approximately 16.0 MMBbls per month and are expected to be completed in two phases by the end of 2015. In April 2014, we announced plans to construct a fully refrigerated ethane export facility located on the Houston Ship Channel, which we expect to begin operations in the third quarter of 2016. In May 2014, we began loading cargoes of refined products for export at our reactivated marine terminal located in Beaumont, Texas. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates during 2014 decreased $371.7 million when compared to 2013. Our spending on the expansion and construction of joint venture crude oil pipelines decreased a net $106.9 million. Spending related to our construction of the Texas Express Pipeline, Texas Express Gathering System and Front Range Pipeline decreased a combined $262.7 million year-to-year. Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Capital spending on growth capital projects for 2013 decreased $144.7 million when compared to 2012. Our spending on growth capital projects in the Eagle Ford Shale region decreased $1.01 billion, partially offset by a combined $801.4 million year-to-year increase in spending on the ATEX and Aegis ethane pipelines and the Rocky Mountain expansion of our Mid-America Pipeline System. Since 2010, expansion of midstream infrastructure in the Eagle Ford Shale region has been a key strategic focus for us. We constructed new NGL, natural gas and crude oil pipelines and the Yoakum natural gas processing plant to facilitate production growth from Eagle Ford Shale producers. As noted above, the construction of midstream infrastructure in the Eagle Ford Shale region has been a key strategic focus for us since 2010, with the build-out of such assets being substantially completed during 2013. 104 Table of Contents A majority of the capital expenditures for ATEX and the Rocky Mountain expansion of our Mid-America Pipeline System were incurred during 2013 (prior to placing these new pipeline assets into service in January 2014). Capital spending on sustaining capital projects for 2013 decreased $71.6 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to a year-to-year decrease in pipeline integrity work and similar projects associated with our Texas Intrastate System and Mid-America Pipeline System. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates for 2013 increased $484.6 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to the expansion of the Seaway Pipeline and construction of the Texas Express Pipeline, Texas Express Gathering System and Front Range Pipeline. Capital Spending Outlook We currently expect our total capital spending for 2015 to approximate $3.9 billion, which includes $380 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our forecast of capital spending for 2015 is based on our announced strategic operating and growth plans (through the filing date of this annual report), which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities. We may revise our forecast of capital spending due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather related issues and changes in supplier prices. Furthermore, our forecast of capital spending may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include the addition of costs in connection with unforeseen acquisition opportunities. Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a significant factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we currently expect to make the forecast capital expenditures noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following describes the estimation risk currently underlying our most significant financial statement items: Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset's cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Our estimate of depreciation expense incorporates management assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected residual values, or (iv) significant changes in the forecast life of proved reserves of applicable resource basins, if any. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $29.88 billion and $26.95 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.11 billion, $1.01 billion and $900.5 million of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 105 Table of Contents Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil or refined products. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated residual values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset's estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes. An equity method investment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible permanent loss in value of the investment (i.e., other than a temporary decline). Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee's industry. When evidence of a loss in value has occurred, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment's underlying assets. A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $34.0 million, $92.6 million and $63.4 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. During 2013, we recorded a $4.8 million non-cash impairment charge related to our equity investment in Neptune. There were no impairment charges in 2014 or 2012 related to our equity method investments. For additional information regarding our equity method investments, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Amortization Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. The method used to value such assets depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns it is expected to generate. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to certain relationships acquired in connection with business combinations and asset purchases whereby (i) we acquired information about or access to customers and now have the ability to provide services to them and (ii) the customers now have the ability to make direct contact with us. Customer relationships may arise from contractual arrangements (such as service contracts) and through means other than contracts, such as through regular contact by sales or service representatives. The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization periods for certain of our customer relationship intangible assets are limited by the estimated finite 106 Table of Contents economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basins. In this context, our estimate of the useful life of each resource basin is predicated on a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. Contract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement and the Jonah natural gas transportation contracts. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a fractionation facility, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements. If our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset's unamortized cost is not recoverable due to impairment, we would be required to reduce the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value through the recording of a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was $2.84 billion and $1.46 billion, respectively. The carrying value of this portfolio increased $1.49 billion in connection with the customer relationship and contract-based intangible assets we acquired in connection with the acquisition of Oiltanking. We recorded $110.6 million, $105.6 million and $125.7 million of amortization expense attributable to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is subject to annual impairment testing at the end of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is probable that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Goodwill impairment testing involves determining the fair value of the associated reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the businesses that make up the reporting unit. Such assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the associated businesses, which, in turn, rely on management's estimates of operating margins, throughput volumes and similar inputs; (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond discrete forecast periods; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of a reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a non-cash charge to operating costs and expenses is required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying value of our goodwill was $4.2 billion and $2.08 billion, respectively. In October 2014, we recorded $2.12 billion of goodwill in connection with Step 1 of our acquisition of Oiltanking. In addition, we recorded an indefinite-life intangible asset valued at $1.46 billion in connection with the acquisition of Oiltanking's incentive distribution rights. The incentive distribution rights represented contractual rights to the incentive cash distributions to be paid by Oiltanking to its general partner. Immediately after completion of the Oiltanking Merger in February 2015, the incentive distribution rights were cancelled in exchange for limited partner interests in Oiltanking, and the carrying value of this intangible asset was reclassified to goodwill. While the incentive distribution rights were outstanding, this intangible asset was not subject to amortization, but was subject to periodic testing for recoverability in a manner similar to goodwill. We attribute the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Oiltanking to our ability to leverage the acquired business with our existing asset base to create future business opportunities. These opportunities include the marketing of NGLs, crude oil and condensate, and refined products. 107 Table of Contents We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2014, 2013 or 2012. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment test at December 31, 2014, each reporting unit's fair value was substantially in excess of its carrying value (i.e., by at least 10%). For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Revenue Recognition Policies and Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses In general, we recognize revenue from customers when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the buyer's price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. We record revenue when sales contracts are settled (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed). We record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts as required by our established policy. For additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Our use of estimates for certain revenues and expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of our use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for a specific period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. If the assumptions underlying our revenue and expense estimates prove to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. We review our estimates based on currently available information. Other Items Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Gross operating margin. We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by our executive management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. For additional information regarding gross operating margin, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 108 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of non-GAAP total segment gross operating margin to GAAP operating income for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Total segment gross operating margin $ 5,286.5 $ 4,818.1 $ 4,387.0 Adjustments to reconcile total segment gross operating margin to operating income: Subtract depreciation, amortization and accretion expense amounts not reflected in gross operating margin (1,282.7 ) (1,148.9 ) (1,061.7 ) Subtract impairment charges not reflected in gross operating margin (34.0 ) (92.6 ) (63.4 ) Add net gains attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries not reflected in gross operating margin 102.1 83.4 17.6 Subtract non-refundable deferred revenues attributable to shipper make-up rights on major new pipeline projects reflected in gross operating margin (84.6 ) (4.4 ) -- Add subsequent recognition of deferred revenues attributable to make-up rights 2.9 -- -- Subtract general and administrative costs not reflected in gross operating margin (214.5 ) (188.3 ) (170.3 ) Operating income $ 3,775.7 $ 3,467.3 $ 3,109.2 Deferred revenues attributable to shipper make-up rights. The results of operations from our liquids pipelines are primarily dependent upon the volumes transported and the associated fees we charge for such transportation services. Typically, pipeline transportation revenue is recognized when volumes are transported and delivered. However, under certain pipeline transportation agreements, customers are required to ship a minimum volume over an agreed-upon period. These arrangements typically entail the shipper paying a transportation fee based on a minimum volume commitment, with a provision that allows the shipper to make-up any volume shortfalls over the agreed-upon period (referred to as shipper ""make-up rights""). Revenue attributable to shipper make-up rights is initially deferred and subsequently recognized at the earlier of when the deficiency volume is shipped, when the shipper's ability to meet the minimum volume commitment has expired (typically a one year contractual period), or when the pipeline is otherwise released from its transportation service performance obligation. However, management includes deferred transportation revenues relating to the ""make-up rights"" of committed shippers when reviewing the financial results of certain major new pipeline projects such as ATEX. From an internal (and segment) reporting standpoint, management considers the transportation fees paid by committed shippers on major new pipeline projects, including any non-refundable revenues that may be deferred under GAAP related to make-up rights, to be important in assessing the financial performance of these pipeline assets. Since management includes these deferred revenues in non-GAAP gross operating margin, these amounts are deducted in determining GAAP-based operating income. Our consolidated revenues do not reflect any deferred revenues until the conditions for recognizing such revenues are met in accordance with GAAP. Several of our major new liquids pipeline projects experienced periods in 2013 and 2014 where shippers were unable to meet their contractual minimum volume commitments. In general, we expect that these types of shortfalls will continue in 2015 due to the current business environment, with the recognition of revenue associated with past deferrals associated with make-up rights partially or entirely offsetting any new make-up right deferrals. 109 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the deferred revenue amounts attributable to shipper make-up rights included in gross operating margin for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 NGL Pipelines & Services: Texas Express Pipeline (1,2) $ 3.2 $ 1.3 Front Range Pipeline (1,2) 5.5 -- ATEX (3) 55.2 -- Aegis Ethane Pipeline 0.9 -- Total segment gross operating margin 64.8 1.3 Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services: Seaway Pipeline (1,4) 19.8 3.1 Total segment gross operating margin 19.8 3.1 Total amount included in overall gross operating margin $ 84.6 $ 4.4 (1) Amounts presented represent our ownership share in these unconsolidated affiliates as follows: Texas Express Pipeline, 35%; Front Range Pipeline, 33.3%; and Seaway Pipeline, 50%. (2) Shippers on the Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline have experienced periods where transportation volumes have been less than committed volumes due to ethane rejection in the supply basins served by these pipelines. (3) Shipper transportation volumes on ATEX have been negatively impacted by changes in producer drilling programs, including the timing of new production well start-ups in the Marcellus and Utica Shale developments. (4) Shippers on Seaway's Longhaul System have experienced periods where transportation volumes have been less than committed volumes due to lower regional crude oil price spreads between the Cushing hub and Gulf Coast destination markets. In general, as price spreads decrease, there is less incentive to ship crude oil to the Gulf Coast. The primary reason for the lower spreads is a narrowing of the price differential between WTI and Brent prices. Distributable cash flow. Our management compares the distributable cash flow we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. Distributable cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly cash distributions. Distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net cash flows provided by operating activities. The following table presents a reconciliation of non-GAAP distributable cash flow to GAAP net cash flows provided by operating activities for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Distributable cash flow $ 4,078.6 $ 3,750.4 $ 4,133.3 Adjustments to reconcile distributable cash flow to net cash flows provided by operating activities: Add sustaining capital expenditures reflected in distributable cash flow 369.0 291.7 366.2 Subtract cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries reflected in distributable cash flow (145.3 ) (280.6 ) (1,198.8 ) Add losses or subtract gains from monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges (27.6 ) 168.8 147.8 Net effect of changes in operating accounts not reflected in distributable cash flow (108.2 ) (97.6 ) (582.5 ) Other, net (4.3 ) 32.8 24.9 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 4,162.2 $ 3,865.5 $ 2,890.9 110 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2014 (dollars in millions): Payment or Settlement due by Period Less than 1-3 4-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1) $ 21,389.2 $ 2,206.5 $ 1,550.0 $ 1,850.0 $ 15,782.7 Estimated cash payments for interest (2) $ 21,303.9 $ 1,005.6 $ 1,921.6 $ 1,746.4 $ 16,630.3 Operating lease obligations (3) $ 542.7 $ 60.5 $ 118.4 $ 91.2 $ 272.6 Purchase obligations: (4) Product purchase commitments: Estimated payment obligations: Natural gas $ 2,139.7 $ 637.5 $ 834.6 $ 490.6 $ 177.0 NGLs $ 487.0 $ 391.1 $ 52.7 $ 43.2 $ -- Crude oil $ 2,425.2 $ 2,279.1 $ 74.7 $ 71.4 $ -- Petrochemicals and refined products $ 1,499.3 $ 956.7 $ 542.6 $ -- $ -- Other $ 71.8 $ 38.1 $ 16.1 $ 8.4 $ 9.2 Underlying major volume commitments: Natural gas (in TBtus) 879 255 347 210 67 NGLs (in MMBbls) 30 17 7 6 -- Crude oil (in MMBbls) 41 38 2 1 -- Petrochemicals and refined products (in MMBbls) 23 15 8 -- -- Service payment commitments (5) $ 850.8 $ 200.6 $ 336.3 $ 152.8 $ 161.1 Capital expenditure commitments (6) $ 1,299.8 $ 1,299.8 $ -- $ -- $ -- Other long-term liabilities (7) $ 310.8 $ -- $ 10.7 $ 8.7 $ 291.4 Total $ 52,320.2 $ 9,075.5 $ 5,457.7 $ 4,462.7 $ 33,324.3 (1) Represents scheduled future maturities of our consolidated debt principal obligations. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2014, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable fixed or variable interest rates paid during 2014. With respect to our variable-rate debt obligations, we applied the weighted-average interest rate paid during 2014 to determine the estimated cash payments. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for the weighted-average variable interest rate charged in 2014 under our revolving credit facility. Our estimated cash payments for interest are significantly influenced by the long-term maturities of our junior subordinated notes (due August 2066 through January 2068). Our estimated cash payments for interest with respect to each junior subordinated note are based on the current fixed interest rate for each note applied to the entire remaining term through the respective maturity date. (3) Primarily represents leases of underground salt dome caverns for the storage of natural gas and NGLs, office space with affiliates of EPCO and land held pursuant to right-of-way agreements. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services as of December 31, 2014. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2014 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Primarily represents our unconditional payment obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts. (6) Represents unconditional payment obligations for services to be rendered or products to be delivered in connection with our capital spending program, including our share of the capital spending of our unconsolidated affiliates. (7) As reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014, Other long-term liabilities primarily represent the Liquidity Option Agreement and the noncurrent portion of asset retirement obligations and deferred revenues. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Related Party Transactions For information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 111 Table of Contents Insurance Matters We participate as a named insured in EPCO's insurance program, which provides us with property damage, business interruption and other insurance coverage, the scope and amounts of which we believe are customary and prudent for the nature and extent of our operations. While we believe EPCO maintains adequate insurance coverage on our behalf, insurance may not fully cover every type of damage, interruption or other loss that might occur. If we were to incur a significant loss for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there may be timing differences between amounts we accrue related to property damage expense, amounts we are required to pay in connection with a loss, and amounts we subsequently receive from insurance carriers as reimbursements. Any event that materially interrupts the revenues generated by our consolidated operations, or other losses that require us to make material expenditures not reimbursed by insurance, could reduce our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders and, accordingly, adversely affect the market price of our common units. Involuntary conversions result from the loss of an asset because of some unforeseen event (e.g., destruction due to fire). Some of these events are insurable, thus resulting in a property damage insurance recovery. Amounts we receive from insurance carriers are net of any deductibles related to the covered event. EPCO's deductibles currently range from $5.0 million to $60.0 million depending on the nature of the loss (windstorm or non-windstorm) and the assets involved (onshore or offshore). We received $95.0 million, $15.0 million and $30.0 million of nonrefundable insurance proceeds during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, attributable to property damage claims we filed in connection with a February 2011 NGL release and fire at the West Storage location of our Mont Belvieu, Texas underground storage facility. Operating income for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 includes $95.0 million, $15.0 million and $30.0 million of gains, respectively, related to these insurance recoveries. The amounts we received during the first quarter of 2014 represent the final payments on this property damage claim. Due to the high cost of windstorm insurance coverage for our offshore Gulf of Mexico assets, we elected to self-insure these assets during the annual policy period extending from June 2013 to June 2014. We continue to self-insure these assets for the current annual policy period, which extends from June 2014 to June 2015. For additional information regarding insurance matters, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Regulation For information regarding the impact of federal, state or local regulatory measures on our business, see ""Regulatory Matters"" included under Part I, Item 1 and 2 of this annual report. Recent Accounting Developments In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board finished their joint project to converge U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards in the area of revenue recognition. The resulting accounting standards update eliminates the transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replaces it with a principles based approach for determining revenue recognition. The core principle in the new guidance is that a company should recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive for those goods or services. In order to apply this core principle, companies will apply the following five steps in determining the amount of revenues to recognize: § identify the contract; 112 Table of Contents § identify the performance obligations in the contract; § determine the transaction price; § allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and § recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Each of these steps involves judgment and an analysis of the contract's terms and conditions. We are continuing to evaluate this recently issued accounting guidance; therefore, we are currently not in a position to estimate its impact on our consolidated financial statements. The effective date of the new standard is January 1, 2017. At present, we expect to adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective method. This modified approach allows us to apply the new standard to (i) all new contracts after the effective date and (ii) all existing contracts as of the effective date through a cumulative adjustment to equity. Consolidated revenues for periods prior to the effective date would not be retrospectively adjusted. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps, options and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding and the discount rates used to determine the present values. The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming: § the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk; § the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and § the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period. We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. Accordingly, the nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. 113 Table of Contents Commodity Hedging Activities The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps, basis swaps and option contracts. The following table summarizes our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2014 (volume measures as noted): Volume (1) Accounting Derivative Purpose Current (2) Long-Term (2) Treatment Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas processing: Forecasted sales of NGLs (MMBbls) (3) 0.9 n/a Cash flow hedge Natural gas marketing: Forecasted sales of natural gas (Bcf) 1.0 n/a Cash flow hedge Natural gas storage inventory management activities (Bcf) 8.6 n/a Fair value hedge NGL marketing: Forecasted purchases of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 9.9 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 10.2 n/a Cash flow hedge Refined products marketing: Forecasted purchases of refined products (MMBbls) 1.2 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of refined products (MMBbls) 1.8 n/a Cash flow hedge Refined products inventory management activities (MMBbls) 0.2 n/a Fair value hedge Crude oil marketing: Forecasted purchases of crude oil (MMBbls) 5.8 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of crude oil (MMBbls) 6.9 n/a Cash flow hedge Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas risk management activities (Bcf) (4,5) 81.4 11.8 Mark-to-market Crude oil risk management activities (MMBbls) (5) 4.2 n/a Mark-to-market (1) Volume for derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflects the total amount of volumes hedged whereas volume for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflects the absolute value of derivative notional volumes. (2) The maximum term for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is December 2015, October 2015 and March 2018, respectively. (3) Forecasted sales of NGL volumes under natural gas processing exclude 0.1 MMBbls of additional hedges executed under contracts that have been designated as normal sales agreements. (4) Current volumes include and 35.2 Bcf of physical derivative instruments that are predominantly priced at a marked-based index plus a premium or minus a discount related to location differences. (5) Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with transportation, processing and storage assets. Our predominant commodity hedging strategies in 2014 and continuing into early 2015 consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities and (ii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory. The objective of our hedging program involving anticipated future commodity purchases and sales is to hedge the margins of certain transportation, storage and blending, processing and fractionation activities by locking in purchases and sales prices through the use of forward contracts and derivative instruments. The objective of our hedging program for inventory is to hedge the fair value of commodity products currently held in inventory by locking in the sales price of the inventory through the use of forward contracts and derivative instruments. Certain basis swaps, basis spread options and other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are used to manage market risks associated with anticipated purchases and sales of commodity products. There is some uncertainty involved in the timing of these transactions often due to the development of more favorable profit opportunities or when spreads are insufficient to cover variable costs thus reducing the likelihood that the transactions will occur during the periods originally forecasted. In accordance with derivatives accounting guidance, these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting even though they are effective at managing the risk exposures of the underlying assets. Due to volatility in commodity prices, future non-cash, mark-to-market earnings variability cannot be predicted. 114 Table of Contents The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our natural gas marketing portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2013 December 31, 2014 January 31, 2015 Fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ (1.3 ) $ 5.8 $ 1.4 Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (6.7 ) 2.4 (1.0 ) Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 4.1 9.2 3.7 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our NGL marketing, refined products marketing and octane enhancement portfolios at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2013 December 31, 2014 January 31, 2015 Fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ (20.7 ) $ 57.8 $ 23.0 Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (69.8 ) 47.5 13.3 Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 28.5 68.2 32.8 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our crude oil marketing portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2013 December 31, 2014 January 31, 2015 Fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset $ 8.2 $ 15.6 $ 22.2 Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (9.8 ) 6.5 9.3 Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 26.1 24.7 35.0 Product Purchase Commitments We have long and short-term purchase commitments for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. For additional information regarding these commitments, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Interest Rate Hedging Activities We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain debt agreements. This strategy has been a component in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. The composition of our derivative instrument portfolios may change from period-to-period depending on our interest rate hedging requirements. At December 31, 2014 and March 2, 2015, we did not have any interest rate hedging derivative instruments outstanding. In July 2014, six undesignated floating-to-fixed swaps having an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million expired. These swaps were accounted for as mark-to-market instruments with changes in fair value recorded in interest expense. As a result of market conditions in early October 2014, we elected to terminate all of our outstanding interest rate swaps. We terminated 10 fixed-to-floating swaps having an aggregate notional value of $750 million, which resulted in cash gains totaling $17.6 million. In addition, we terminated 16 fixed-to-floating swaps having a total notional value of $800 million entered into in connection with the issuance of Senior Notes LL in October 2014. The early termination of these 16 swaps resulted in cash gains totaling $10.0 million. Since both groups of swaps were accounted for as fair value hedges, the aggregate $27.6 million of gains will be carried as a component of long-term debt and be amortized into earnings (as a decrease in interest expense) using the effective interest method over the remaining life of the associated debt obligations. The $17.6 million gain will be amortized through 115 Table of Contents January 2016 and the $10.0 million gain will be amortized through October 2019.",2023-12-30 21:17:08.508197

Overview of Business We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") under the ticker symbol ""EPD."" We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids (""NGLs"") related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Our midstream energy operations currently include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and import and export terminals (including liquefied petroleum gas or ""LPG""); crude oil gathering, transportation, storage and terminals; petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage and terminals, and related services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems and in the Gulf of Mexico. Our assets currently include approximately 49,000 miles of pipelines; 250 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products; and 14 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity. We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (""ASA"") or by other service providers. Our historical operations are reported under five business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, (iv) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services and (v) Offshore Pipelines & Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. On July 24, 2015, we completed the sale of our Offshore Business, which primarily consisted of our Offshore Pipelines & Services segment. Our consolidated financial statements reflect ownership of the Offshore Business through July 24, 2015. Each of our remaining business segments benefits from the supporting role of our related marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted accounting principle (""non-GAAP"") financial measure, for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. 64 Table of Contents Significant Recent Developments Enterprise Management to Recommend 5.2% Distribution Growth for 2016 In January 2016, our management announced plans to recommend to the Board of Enterprise GP cash distributions totaling $1.61 per unit with respect to 2016, which, if approved by the Board, would represent a 5.2% increase compared to a total of $1.53 per unit of distributions declared with respect to calendar year 2015. The recommended quarterly cash distributions for 2016 would be as follows (with respect to each quarter presented): $0.395, first quarter; $0.400, second quarter; $0.405, third quarter; and $0.410, fourth quarter. Historically, it has been our practice to not provide guidance with respect to distribution growth; however, due to recent actions by some of our midstream peers to reduce or freeze their dividends/distributions, we believe it is important to provide our investors with visibility into management's planned recommendations for our distribution growth for 2016 based on current expectations. Enterprise Among First Companies to Export U.S. Crude Oil In December 2015, the U.S. government lifted its 40-year ban on exports of domestically produced crude oil. As a result of this recent change in law, we provided pipeline and marine terminal services at our Houston Ship Channel facility in January 2016 to load an export cargo of 600 thousand barrels of domestic light crude oil. We believe that removal of the crude oil export ban facilitates economic growth and job creation for the United States as well as enhances our national and energy security. This action also provides new markets to domestic producers, especially producers of light crude oil, and the global markets with supply diversification. Completion of Expansion Projects at our Houston Ship Channel LPG Export Terminal In December 2015, we completed the final phase of an expansion project at our Houston Ship Channel LPG Export Terminal that increased its loading capability from 9.0 MMBbls per month to 16.0 MMBbls per month. Our maximum loading capacity at this marine terminal is now approximately 27,500 barrels per hour. The expansion of our Houston Ship Channel LPG Export Terminal is supported by long-term LPG sales agreements with exporters. In November 2015, we announced the execution of additional long-term contracts with customers to export a total of approximately 125 MMBbls of LPG over a seven-year period from this terminal. Including the volume associated with these additional agreements, our Houston Ship Channel facility is now over 90% subscribed, in terms of estimated operating capacity, through 2019. Furthermore, a majority of the terminal's operating capacity is under contract extending into 2022. Completion of Aegis Ethane Pipeline In December 2015, we completed the remaining 162-mile segment of the Aegis Ethane Pipeline (""Aegis"") from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Napoleonville, Louisiana. This new 162-mile segment, along with the 108 miles of Aegis previously placed into service, provides reliable ethane supplies to petrochemical facilities between Mont Belvieu, Texas and the Mississippi River in Louisiana. When combined with our South Texas NGL Pipeline System, Aegis provides shippers with access to an ethane header system stretching approximately 500 miles between Corpus Christi, Texas and the Mississippi River in Louisiana. Aegis is supported by customer commitments in excess of 360 MBPD that ramp up over the next four years. Sale of Offshore Business On July 24, 2015, we completed the sale of our Offshore Business to Genesis, which primarily consisted of our Offshore Pipelines & Services business segment, for approximately $1.53 billion in cash. The Offshore Business served drilling and development regions, including deepwater production fields, in the northern Gulf of Mexico offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama and included approximately 2,350 miles of offshore natural gas and crude oil pipelines and six offshore hub platforms. Our results of operations reflect ownership of the Offshore Business through July 24, 2015. We viewed the Offshore Business as an extension of our midstream energy services network. As such, sale of these assets did not represent a strategic shift in our consolidated operations, and their sale does not have a major effect on our financial results. The sale of this non-strategic business allowed us to redeploy capital to other business opportunities that we believe will generate a higher rate of return for us in the future. Also, proceeds from this sale reduced our need to issue additional equity and debt to support our ongoing capital spending program. 65 Table of Contents For additional information regarding this sale, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Expansion of Propylene Pipeline System In July 2015, we announced a series of projects to convert and expand segments of our petrochemicals pipeline network in order to increase throughput capacity for polymer grade propylene (""PGP"") and enhance system flexibility and reliability. § North Dean pipeline conversion and expansion – The 149-mile pipeline will be converted from refinery grade propylene (""RGP"") service to PGP service. The conversion is scheduled for completion in January 2017. Originating at our Mont Belvieu, Texas complex, the converted pipeline will serve petrochemical facilities as far south as Seadrift, Texas in Calhoun County. Construction of a 33-mile lateral pipeline, new metering stations and additional pumping capacity will accommodate the additional volumes and increase total PGP delivery capacity to more than 150 MBPD. § Lou-Tex propylene pipeline conversion – The 263-mile, bi-directional pipeline, which currently transports chemical grade propylene between Sorrento, Louisiana and Mont Belvieu, Texas will be converted to PGP service. The conversion is scheduled for completion in 2020. § RGP pipeline and rail terminal expansion – Construction of a new 65-mile, 10-inch diameter pipeline, which will transport RGP between Sorrento and Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, is scheduled for completion in early 2017. Rail receipt facilities at Mont Belvieu are also being expanded to give us the capability to unload up to 80 RGP rail cars per day. We currently have six propylene fractionation units at our Mont Belvieu complex. Following completion of the new propane dehydrogenation (""PDH"") plant, we will have the capability to produce 8 billion pounds of PGP annually at our Mont Belvieu complex. In addition, a portion of our salt dome storage capacity in Mont Belvieu is dedicated to PGP service. Acquisition of Eagle Ford Midstream Assets In July 2015, we purchased EFS Midstream from affiliates of Pioneer and Reliance for approximately $2.1 billion. The purchase price will be paid in two installments. The first installment of approximately $1.1 billion was paid at closing on July 8, 2015 and the final installment of approximately $1.0 billion will be paid no later than the first anniversary of the closing date. The effective date of the acquisition was July 1, 2015. The EFS Midstream System provides condensate gathering and processing services as well as gathering, treating and compression services for the associated natural gas. The EFS Midstream System includes approximately 460 miles of gathering pipelines, ten central gathering plants, 119 MBPD of condensate stabilization capacity and 780 MMcf/d of associated natural gas treating capacity. Our primary purpose in acquiring the EFS Midstream System was to secure the underlying production, particularly condensate, for our midstream asset network. Under terms of the associated agreements, Pioneer and Reliance have dedicated certain of their Eagle Ford Shale acreage to us under 20-year, fixed-fee gathering agreements that include minimum volume requirement for the first seven years. Pioneer and Reliance have also entered into related 20-year fee-based agreements with us for natural gas transportation and processing, NGL transportation and fractionation, and for condensate and crude oil transportation services. In connection with the agreements to acquire EFS Midstream, we are obligated to spend up to an aggregate of $270 million on specified midstream gathering assets for Pioneer and Reliance, if requested by these producers, over a ten-year period. If constructed, these new assets would be owned by us and be a component of the EFS Midstream System. For additional information regarding our acquisition of EFS Midstream, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 66 Table of Contents Plans to Construct Crude Oil and Condensate Pipeline from Midland to Sealy, Texas In April 2015, we announced the execution of long-term agreements that support development of a new 24-inch diameter pipeline (the ""Midland-to-Sealy"" pipeline) that would transport increasing volumes of crude oil and condensate from the Permian Basin to markets in southeast Texas. The new pipeline will originate at our Midland, Texas crude oil terminal and extend 416 miles to our Sealy, Texas storage facility. Volumes arriving at Sealy would then be transported to our ECHO terminal using our Rancho II pipeline. Using the ECHO terminal, shippers will have direct access to every refinery in Houston, Texas City, Beaumont and Port Arthur, as well as our dock facilities. The Midland-to-Sealy pipeline is expected to have an initial transportation capacity of 300 MBPD and is expandable up to 450 MBPD. Committed shippers on the pipeline recently requested to extend the construction timeline by up to one year, and we are currently evaluating our ability to accommodate their needs. The pipeline was originally scheduled to commence operations in mid-2017. Plans to Construct Natural Gas Processing Facility in Delaware Basin In April 2015, we formed a joint venture with an affiliate of Occidental Petroleum Corporation to develop a new 150 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing facility that will accommodate growing production of NGL-rich natural gas from the Delaware Basin. The facility is supported by long-term, firm contracts and is expected to begin operations in mid-2016. We serve as construction manager for the project and will serve as operator once the new facility commences operations. The new facility is located in Reeves County, Texas. Formation of Panola Pipeline Joint Venture In February 2015, we formed a joint venture involving our Panola Pipeline with affiliates of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (""Anadarko""), DCP Midstream Partners, LP (""DCP"") and MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. (""MarkWest""). We will continue to serve as operator of the Panola Pipeline and own 55% of the member interests in the joint venture. Affiliates of Anadarko, DCP and MarkWest will own the remaining 45% member interests, with each holding a 15% interest. The Panola Pipeline transports mixed NGLs from points near Carthage, Texas to Mont Belvieu and supports the Haynesville and Cotton Valley oil and gas production areas. In January 2015, we announced an expansion project involving the Panola Pipeline consisting of the installation of 60 miles of new pipeline, as well as pumps and other related equipment designed to increase the system's throughput capacity by 50 MBPD to approximately 100 MBPD. The incremental capacity is expected to be available in the first quarter of 2016. Completion of Oiltanking Acquisition In October 2014, we completed the first step (""Step 1"") of a two-step acquisition of Oiltanking by paying approximately $4.41 billion to OTA for Oiltanking GP, the related IDRs and approximately 65.9% of the limited partner interests of Oiltanking. As a second step (""Step 2"") of the Oiltanking acquisition (separately negotiated by the conflicts committee of Oiltanking GP on behalf of Oiltanking), we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""merger agreement"") with Oiltanking in November 2014 that provided for the following: § the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of ours with and into Oiltanking, with Oiltanking surviving the merger as our wholly owned subsidiary; and § all outstanding common units of Oiltanking at the effective time of the merger held by Oiltanking's public unitholders (which consisted of Oiltanking unitholders other than us and our subsidiaries) to be cancelled and converted into our common units based on an exchange ratio of 1.30 of our common units for each Oiltanking common unit. In accordance with the merger agreement and Oiltanking's partnership agreement, the merger was submitted to a vote of Oiltanking's common unitholders, with the required majority of unitholders (including our ownership interests) voting to approve the merger on February 13, 2015. Upon approval of the merger, a total of 36,827,517 of our common units were issued to Oiltanking's former public unitholders. With the completion of Step 2, total consideration paid by us for Oiltanking was approximately $6.02 billion. 67 Table of Contents On February 23, 2015, we received a Civil Investigative Demand and a related Subpoena Duces Tecum from the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") requesting specified information relating to the Oiltanking acquisition and Enterprise's operations. On April 13, 2015, we received a Civil Investigative Demand issued by the Attorney General of the State of Texas requesting copies of the same information and any correspondence with the FTC. We are in the process of complying with the requests and are cooperating with the investigations. Based on the limited information that we have at this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of the investigations. For additional information regarding the Oiltanking acquisition, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. General Outlook for 2016 Commercial Outlook Supply Side Observations As a result of significant advances in non-conventional drilling and production technology, North American reserves and production of hydrocarbons, primarily from shale resource basins such as the Eagle Ford in South Texas, the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Appalachia Basin in the Northeast U.S., increased substantially in recent years. The increase in U.S. hydrocarbon supplies led to a reduction in imports of crude oil, NGLs, refined products and natural gas into the U.S. Conversely, this trend has resulted in significant increases in hydrocarbon exports from the U.S., particularly of refined products and LPGs. In light of a weaker global economic outlook (especially for Europe and China) and in the face of increasing production from North America and certain countries in the Middle East and Africa, global production and inventories of hydrocarbons (particularly crude oil) began to exceed demand in 2014. In response to the growing supplies, beginning in November 2014, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, opted to defend its market share by maintaining (and in some cases increasing) its crude oil production levels. The result has been a dramatic decline in global crude oil prices from an average of approximately $93 per barrel in 2014 to $49 per barrel in 2015, as measured by the price of West Texas Intermediate (""WTI""). As a result of excess domestic supplies, natural gas prices also experienced a significant year-to-year decline from an average of approximately $4.43 per MMBtu in 2014 to $2.67 per MMBtu in 2015, as measured at Henry Hub. In response to lower energy commodity prices, domestic producers began to reduce their drilling activity in 2015; however, because of the lagging effect of production to drilling activity, average crude oil production for 2015 is estimated to have increased by approximately 700 MBPD when compared to 2014. WTI prices declined further in January 2016, averaging $32 per barrel. In early February 2016, the International Energy Agency (""IEA"") reported that crude oil inventories in developed nations increased counter-seasonally in December 2015 by 7.6 MMBbls to 3 billion barrels, which is approximately 350 MMBbls above average. The IEA recently estimated that global crude oil supplies for the first half of 2016 may exceed demand by approximately 1.5 MMBPD. In reaction to this period of low energy prices and high inventories, the debt ratings agencies Moody's Investor Service (""Moody's"") and Standard & Poor's (""Standard & Poor's) announced downgrades and/or negative credit outlooks for many oil and gas producers, oilfield service companies and midstream companies. In January 2016, Moody's placed 120 energy companies on review for a possible downgrade as Moody's saw substantial risk that crude oil prices may recover much more slowly over the medium term than many companies expect, as well as a risk that prices might fall further. We have not been included in any of these actions and changes in outlooks. 68 Table of Contents Many producers have announced additional reductions in drilling activity in 2016 to preserve their cash flow, financial position and liquidity. At the beginning of February 2016, the U.S. oil and gas rig count as measured by Baker Hughes dropped to 571 rigs, the lowest level since June 1999. Per Baker Hughes, rig counts in substantially all of the major shale and non-conventional basins are either at new near term lows or matching previous lows. While the rate of hydrocarbon production growth has slowed due to low prices, the domestic crude oil and natural gas industry has been able to significantly reduce drilling and completion costs through continued improvements in technology and more efficient processes, including focusing on only the best drilling locations. Most forecasters predict that production of oil and gas in the U.S. could decline in the range of 5% to 10% during 2016, but, in general, we do not expect drastic reductions in overall U.S production levels in 2016 in spite of the low price environment. However, certain regions such as the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Mid-Continent areas may see crude oil and condensate production declines of 10% to 20% in 2016. With respect to natural gas, certain regions such as the Barnett, Fayetteville, Mid-Continent, Haynesville, Rockies and Eagle Ford areas may experience production declines from 5% to 15%. As a result, we expect certain of our assets in the Eagle Ford, Rockies and Haynesville areas to be impacted by lower volumes in 2016. Due to lower global energy prices, indications are that plans for longer lead time, capital intensive projects are being delayed or in many instances cancelled as exploration and production companies shift their focus to shorter lead time and less risky projects. We believe that U.S. shale resource basins favor this low risk, short lead time production profile, and that U.S. shale producers will continue to play an increasing role in both domestic and global markets as markets begin to stabilize because of their cost competitiveness, lower capital commitments before production and flexibility. These attributes lead certain energy experts to believe U.S. shale production is now the world's swing crude oil supply that would influence global crude oil prices at the margin and keep prices range bound. Long-term, we believe that production basins located closest to prime markets such as the U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemical and refining complex (e.g., the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin regions) will continue to be preferred by producers due to more favorable economics as compared to other more distant areas (mostly due to reduced transportation costs). In contrast to the negative impacts on energy producers, lower energy commodity prices have led to an increase in energy consumption by individual consumers, particularly for gasoline, and by energy intensive industries (e.g., steel manufacturing and petrochemicals) as lower energy and feedstock costs reduce the operating costs for such businesses and in some instances make them more globally competitive. We believe that an increase in demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs from these types of industries, along with other positive consumer-driven demand responses to the lower prices, may begin to balance crude oil supply and demand fundamentals by the end of 2016. Regardless of such market dynamics, almost all of the major assets we have under construction or have recently completed, whether supply or demand oriented, are supported by long-term fee-based commitments from producers, shippers and/or end-use customers. For additional information regarding our recent significant projects, see ""Significant Recent Developments"" within this Part II, Item 7. Demand Side Opportunities In recent years, natural gas and NGLs developed a feedstock price advantage over more costly crude oil derivatives (such as naphtha). In general, we expect this trend to continue due to: (i) ongoing production from domestic shale resource plays and efforts by producers to lower associated drilling costs; (ii) anticipated long-term increases in demand for crude oil by developing economies; and (iii) geopolitical risks in many areas of the world that are major exporters of crude oil, which may cause unexpected crude oil price increases. This price advantage lends itself to a variety of demand-side opportunities, including higher demand from the U.S. petrochemical industry and increased exports of various hydrocarbons (e.g., LPG, ethane and crude oil). 69 Table of Contents Energy consumers in the industrial manufacturing and power generation sectors are continuing to adjust their feedstock and asset portfolios to consume increasing amounts of natural gas and NGLs in their operations. We believe the trend in the feedstock price advantage of domestically-produced NGLs and their abundance has led to a long-term fundamental change in feedstock selection by the U.S. petrochemical industry, which is the largest consumer of domestic NGLs. Since NGLs typically trade at a significant discount compared to crude oil, using NGLs as a feedstock generally provides a substantial cost advantage for U.S. petrochemical companies when compared to using naphtha, whose price is closely linked to crude oil prices. In order to capitalize on this cost advantage, U.S. petrochemical companies have maximized their consumption of domestic NGLs. Many of these companies have also announced plans to invest billions of dollars to construct NGL feedstock-oriented, world-scale ethylene plants on the Gulf Coast. For example: § Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. announced in December 2011 that it expects to build a 1.5 million metric tons per year ethylene plant in Cedar Bayou, Texas by 2017; § Formosa Plastics Corp. USA announced in March 2012 that it expects to build an 800 thousand metric tons per year ethylene plant along the U.S. Gulf Coast by 2016/2017; § The Dow Chemical Company announced in April 2012 that it expects to build a 1.5 million metric tons per year ethylene plant along the U.S. Gulf Coast by 2017; § Sasol Ltd. announced in October 2014 that it had reached final approval to build a 1.5 million metric ton per year ethylene and derivatives plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, expected to be completed by 2017; § Axiall Corporation and Lotte Chemical Corporation announced in December 2015 that they have finalized joint-venture arrangements to construct an ethane cracker in Lake Charles, Louisiana with expected completion in early 2019; and § numerous other petrochemical companies have announced significant expansions and or conversions to ethane at existing facilities. Almost all of these ethylene plants and the ethylene industry's major expansions are in close proximity to our existing or planned assets, including our recently completed Aegis Ethane Pipeline. Based on industry publications, domestic production of ethylene in 2015 was estimated to be 155 million pounds per day compared to 146 million pounds per day in 2014. Ethane is the most widely used feedstock by the U.S. petrochemical industry in the production of ethylene. As a result, ethane consumption by domestic petrochemical companies has, at times, been in excess of 1.1 MMBPD. We believe the U.S. ethylene industry could consume approximately 200 MBPD of additional ethane feedstocks over the next few years through modifications, debottlenecking and expansions at existing facilities. In addition, we believe that announced new petrochemical plant construction projects, including those noted in the preceding paragraph, could consume well over 900 MBPD of additional ethane feedstocks when completed. However, ethane production capacity continues to be significantly in excess of the ethylene industry's ability to consume ethane, resulting in significant volumes of ethane not being extracted from the natural gas stream by producers and natural gas processors in an effort to balance ethane supply to demand. In the absence of additional near-term demand growth or a significant drop in production, we expect ethane to remain oversupplied. This oversupply could lower the value of our equity NGL production and reduce the volumes that would otherwise be handled by our downstream NGL fractionators and pipelines. 70 Table of Contents U.S. exports of fully refrigerated LPG continue to increase as a result of ample domestic production, increased export capacity and competitive, transparent pricing when compared to international markets. Overall, U.S. propane waterborne exports increased from approximately 390 MBPD in 2014 to 615 MBPD in 2015. Markets in Central and South America have been the major source of new demand for U.S. LPG exports; however, volumes are also being transported to Northwest Europe and the Far East. LPG exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Central and South America are expected to increase in the future as these economies continue to develop. Furthermore, we expect that increased volumes of Gulf Coast-sourced LPGs will be exported in the coming years to Asian markets due to growth of these economies and completion of the Panama Canal expansion, which is anticipated in 2016. In anticipation of the aforementioned growth in LPG exports, we recently completed the final phase of an expansion project at our Houston Ship Channel LPG Export Terminal that increased its loading rate for LPG (nameplate capacity) to approximately 27,500 barrels per hour. In addition to LPG, we expect that exports of domestically produced ethane will increase in the coming years. We estimate that U.S. ethane production capacity currently exceeds U.S. demand by 500 MBPD to 600 MBPD and could exceed demand by up to 700 MBPD by 2020, after considering the estimated incremental demand from new third party ethylene facilities that have been announced for the Gulf Coast. Our Houston Ship Channel ethane export facility, which we expect to place into service in the third quarter of 2016, will provide producers with access to international markets for domestically-produced ethane, and will assist U.S. producers in increasing (or maintaining) their associated production of natural gas, condensate and crude oil. When completed, our ethane export facility is expected to have an aggregate loading rate (nameplate capacity) of approximately 10,000 barrels per hour and will be integrated with our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation and storage complex. Up to now, U.S. ethane exports were generally limited to petrochemical customers in Canada that could receive volumes by pipeline. We believe that as U.S. supply and demand for natural gas and ethane becomes more balanced through exports and incremental demand from ethylene facilities that natural gas and ethane prices will stabilize and increase. Supply basins with dry natural gas and some of the lowest development costs in the U.S. such as the Haynesville/Bossier, Barnett, Fayetteville, Piceance and Jonah/Pinedale shales could experience an increase in drilling activity to maintain, and potentially increase, their future production levels. The Haynesville resource basin is an excellent example of a dry gas area that could experience substantial increase in drilling activity as liquefied natural gas exports and industrial demand from the U.S. Gulf Coast increase over the next few years. In December 2015, the U.S. government completely lifted its ban on exporting domestically produced crude oil, and we believe that this should be beneficial to the domestic crude oil and natural gas industry in general and to us in particular. Our assets are strategically located on the U.S. Gulf Coast where we could see simultaneous imports and exports of various grades of crude oil as refineries optimize their crude oil input slate, trading companies import and export different grades of crude oil depending on global and regional supply-demand factors, and producers optimize their production depending on market price signals. With significant crude oil export capabilities at Freeport, Texas City, in the Houston Ship Channel and at Beaumont, Texas, lifting of the export ban should have a beneficial impact on our crude oil pipeline, storage and dock assets (without any significant expenditure). However, this outlook could be muted if there is a prolonged reduction in domestic crude oil drilling and production, or if overseas crude markets become significantly discounted compared to the U.S. Gulf Coast for an extended period. Liquidity Outlook Debt and equity prices for the energy sector, including those companies with investment grade credit ratings, has decreased significantly since mid-2014. This has generally impacted both the cost of capital and access to capital. Throughout 2015, the corporate debt and equity capital markets were accessible to us, along with adequate credit availability from banks. At December 31, 2015, we had $4.4 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $4.38 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO's revolving credit facilities and $19.0 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations, access to capital markets and access to bank capital to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. In February 2016, we repaid EPO's $750 million Senior Notes AA using available cash, borrowings under our Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under our commercial paper program. We do not have any other senior note obligations maturing in 2016. Our next maturing series of senior notes (in the aggregate principal amount of $800 million) are due in September 2017. 71 Table of Contents The U.S. government is expected to continue to run substantial annual budget deficits in the coming years that will require a corresponding issuance of debt by the U.S. Treasury. The interest rate on U.S. Treasury debt has a direct impact on the cost of our debt. At this time, we are uncertain what impact the expected large issuances of U.S. Treasury debt and the prevailing economic and capital market conditions during these future periods will have on the cost and availability of capital, and we have not executed any forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our expected future debt issuances in connection with the refinancing of debt. We continue to monitor and evaluate the condition of the capital markets and our interest rate risk with respect to funding our capital spending program and refinancing upcoming maturities.

(3) PGP prices represent average contract pricing for such product as reported by Chemical Market Associates, Inc. (""CMAI""). RGP prices represent weighted-average spot prices for such product as reported by CMAI. (4) Crude oil prices are based on commercial index prices for WTI as measured on the New York Mercantile Exchange (""NYMEX"") and for LLS as reported by Platts. Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices. Energy commodity prices fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including supply and demand imbalances and geopolitical tensions. Crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been depressed since the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to an oversupply of these commodities on world markets. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.49 per gallon in 2015 versus $0.97 per gallon in 2014 and $1.02 per gallon in 2013. A decrease in our consolidated marketing revenues due to lower energy commodity sales prices may not result in a decrease in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also be lower due to comparable decreases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same correlation would be true in the case of higher energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs. We attempt to mitigate any commodity price exposure through our hedging activities as well as through converting keepwhole and similar contracts to fee-based arrangements. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities. 74 Table of Contents Consolidated Income Statement Highlights The following information highlights significant changes in our comparative income statement amounts and the primary drivers of such changes. Comparison of 2015 with 2014 Revenues Total revenues for 2015 decreased $20.92 billion when compared to total revenues for 2014. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil and natural gas decreased $11.52 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $10.43 billion decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $1.09 billion decrease. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs and refined products decreased a net $8.13 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for an $8.81 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $680.8 million increase. Revenues from the marketing of petrochemicals, octane additives and high purity isobutylene (""HPIB"") decreased $1.49 billion year-to-year attributable to lower sales prices. Revenues from midstream services increased a net $249.8 million year-to-year primarily due to the ongoing expansion of our operations. Revenues increased $163.4 million year-to-year due to the timing of our acquisition of Oiltanking. Revenues for 2015 include $117.8 million from assets we acquired in connection with the EFS Midstream acquisition. Revenues decreased $72.6 million year-to-year primarily due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015. The remaining $41.2 million year-to-year increase in revenues is primarily due to recently completed assets such as the ATEX pipeline, portions of Aegis and expanded crude oil storage capacity at our ECHO terminal. Operating costs and expenses Total operating costs and expenses for 2015 decreased $20.55 billion when compared to total operating costs and expenses for 2014. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil and natural gas decreased $11.05 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $10.02 billion decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $1.03 billion decrease. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs and refined products decreased a net $8.13 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for an $8.78 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $651.3 million increase. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of petrochemicals, octane additives and HPIB decreased $1.64 billion year-to-year attributable to lower purchase prices. Other operating costs and expenses decreased a net $92.4 million year-to-year due in part to (i) lower fuel costs, which accounted for a $73.9 million decrease, (ii) a producer settlement involving our San Juan Gathering System in 2014, which accounted for an $18.0 million decrease and (iii) the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015, which primarily accounted for an additional $25.2 million year-to-year decrease. These decreases were partially offset by the addition of $49.3 million in operating costs attributable to the timing of the Oiltanking acquisition and assets we acquired in the EFS Midstream acquisition. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses in operating costs and expenses increased $145.5 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to the Oiltanking and EFS Midstream acquisitions, which collectively accounted for $115.7 million of the year-to-year increase. Accretion expense for 2015 includes $39.5 million recognized for certain asset retirement obligations of our former Offshore Business. For information regarding our asset retirement obligations, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. We recorded net losses within operating costs and expenses of $15.6 million attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries in 2015 compared to net gains of $102.1 million in 2014. In 2015, we recognized a $12.3 million loss attributable to our sale of the Offshore Business. In 2014, we recognized $95.0 million of gains attributable to the receipt of nonrefundable cash insurance proceeds. These proceeds were attributable to property damage claims we filed in connection with the February 2011 NGL release and fire at the West Storage location of our Mont Belvieu, Texas underground storage facility. 75 Table of Contents Operating costs and expenses also include $162.6 million and $34.0 million of non-cash asset impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recorded a $54.8 million non-cash asset impairment charge for 2015 in connection with the sale of our Offshore Business. The remainder of our non-cash asset impairment charges for 2015 primarily relate to natural gas processing assets in southern Louisiana, certain marine vessels and the abandonment of certain crude oil and natural gas pipeline assets in Texas. General and administrative costs General and administrative costs for 2015 decreased $21.9 million when compared to 2014 primarily due to lower employee compensation costs, which accounted for a $14.8 million decrease. In addition, general and administrative costs for 2014 included $3.8 million of transaction costs associated with Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition and $4.7 million of expense for the settlement of litigation associated with our merger in 2010 with Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates increased $114.1 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to increased earnings from our investments in crude oil and NGL pipeline joint ventures. Interest expense Interest expense for 2015 increased $40.8 million when compared to 2014. The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 1,063.4 $ 969.1 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization 15.4 9.4 Interest cost capitalized in connection with construction projects (1) (149.1 ) (77.9 ) Other (2) 32.1 20.4 Total $ 961.8 $ 921.0 (1) We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) ratably over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital spending levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. (2) Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is the primary driver of interest expense, increased a net $94.3 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2015, which accounted for a $157.6 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates in 2015, which accounted for a $63.3 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2015 was $22.24 billion compared to $18.96 billion during 2014. In general, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital spending program. For a discussion of our consolidated debt obligations and capital spending program, see ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" within this Part II, Item 7. Change in fair value of Liquidity Option Agreement Results for 2015 include $25.4 million of expense we recorded to recognize changes in the fair value of the Liquidity Option Agreement. For information regarding the Liquidity Option Agreement, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Income taxes We recognized an overall income tax benefit of $2.5 million for 2015 compared to a provision for income taxes of $23.1 million for 2014. This year-to-year change is primarily due to our accruals for state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (""Texas Margin Tax""). In June 2015, the State of Texas enacted certain changes to the Texas Margin Tax, which lowered the tax rate. 76 Table of Contents Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $8.9 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to the inclusion of noncontrolling interests in Oiltanking from October 1, 2014 to February 13, 2015, which is the date we completed the Oiltanking acquisition. Comparison of 2014 with 2013 Revenues Total revenues for 2014 increased $224.2 million when compared to total revenues for 2013. Revenues from the marketing of natural gas increased $609.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $534.7 million increase. Revenues from the marketing of refined products increased a net $435.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $502.5 million increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $66.8 million decrease. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil decreased a net $584.5 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $4.59 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $4.01 billion increase. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs decreased $455.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $254.8 million decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $201.1 million decrease. Collectively, revenues from the marketing of octane additives and HPIB decreased $434.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales volumes, which in turn were attributable to lower production volumes caused by unscheduled plant maintenance outages. Revenues from midstream services increased $648.0 million year-to-year primarily due to the ongoing expansion of our operations. Recently completed assets such as the ATEX pipeline and the Rocky Mountain expansion of our Mid-America Pipeline System as well as certain assets in the Eagle Ford Shale and at our Mont Belvieu complex contributed approximately $400 million of this increase. Also, our consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 included $57.5 million from Oiltanking's operations. On October 1, 2014, we acquired a controlling financial interest in Oiltanking; therefore, we began consolidating the financial results of Oiltanking on this date. For additional information regarding the Oiltanking acquisition, see ""Significant Recent Developments"" within this Part II, Item 7. Operating costs and expenses Total operating costs and expenses for 2014 decreased $18.2 million when compared to total operating costs and expenses for 2013. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of natural gas increased $343.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher purchase prices, which accounted for a $283.8 million increase. Cost of sales associated with our marketing of refined products increased a net $400.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher purchase prices, which accounted for a $469.5 million increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $69.1 million decrease. Cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil decreased a net $405.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase costs, which accounted for a $4.25 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $3.84 billion increase. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs decreased $383.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $255.3 million decrease, and lower purchase costs, which accounted for an additional $128.4 million decrease. Collectively, the cost of sales associated with our marketing of octane additives and HPIB decreased $261.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase costs, which accounted for a $160.9 million decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $100.8 million decrease. Other operating costs and expenses increased $231.4 million year-to-year. The primary driver of this increase is the ongoing expansion of our operations, including that associated with recently completed assets being placed into service (e.g., our ATEX pipeline and expansion of the Rocky Mountain segment of our Mid-America Pipeline System). We estimate that asset expansions accounted for approximately $125.0 million of the $231.4 million increase in expense. In addition, the year-to-year increase includes $18.0 million of expense we recorded in 2014 in connection with a producer settlement involving our San Juan Gathering System and a $16.6 million benefit we recognized in 2013, which represents a negative variance year-to-year, attributable to reductions in a provision for certain pipeline capacity obligations. Other operating costs and expenses for 2014 also include $14.8 million of expenses attributable to Oiltanking's operations in the fourth quarter of 2014. 77 Table of Contents Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses in operating costs and expenses increased $133.8 million in 2014 when compared to 2013 primarily due to recently constructed assets being placed into service. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2014 also included $25.0 million attributable to Oiltanking for the fourth quarter of 2014. We recorded net gains within operating costs and expenses of $102.1 million attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries in 2014 compared to $83.4 million in 2013. In 2014, we recognized $95.0 million of gains attributable to the receipt of nonrefundable cash insurance proceeds related to our West Storage property damage claims compared to $15.0 million of such gains in 2013. In March 2013, we sold the Stratton Ridge-to-Mont Belvieu segment of the Seminole Pipeline, along with a related storage cavern, and recognized a $52.5 million gain on the sale. General and administrative costs General and administrative costs for 2014 increased $26.2 million when compared to 2013 primarily due to higher employee compensation costs, which accounted for $17.3 million of the increase, transaction costs of $3.8 million associated with Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition, and $4.7 million of expense for the settlement of litigation. Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates increased $92.2 million in 2014 when compared to 2013 primarily due to increased earnings from our investments in crude oil pipeline joint ventures. Interest expense Interest expense for 2014 increased $118.5 million when compared to 2013. The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 969.1 $ 911.7 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization 9.4 3.3 Interest cost capitalized in connection with construction projects (77.9 ) (133.0 ) Other 20.4 20.5 Total $ 921.0 $ 802.5 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding increased a net $57.4 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2014, which accounted for a $97.9 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates in 2014, which accounted for a $40.5 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2014 was $18.96 billion compared to $17.14 billion for 2013. Our debt principal balances have increased over time primarily due to the partial debt financing of our capital spending program. Capitalized interest decreased $55.1 million year-to-year primarily due to assets being placed into service. For a discussion of our consolidated debt obligations and capital spending program, see ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" within this Part II, Item 7. Income taxes Provision for income taxes decreased $34.4 million in 2014 when compared to 2013 primarily due to changes in our accruals for state tax obligations under the Texas Margin Tax. For additional information regarding our income taxes, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $35.9 million in 2014 when compared to 2013 primarily due to increased earnings from the underlying joint ventures and the inclusion of noncontrolling interests in Oiltanking effective October 1, 2014. 78 Table of Contents Business Segment Highlights We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by our executive management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. We include equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin and operating income. The following table presents gross operating margin by segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 NGL Pipelines & Services $ 2,771.6 $ 2,877.7 $ 2,514.4 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services 961.9 762.5 742.7 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 782.6 803.3 789.0 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services 718.5 681.0 625.9 Offshore Pipelines & Services 97.5 162.0 146.1 Total $ 5,332.1 $ 5,286.5 $ 4,818.1 The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. See ""Other Items – Non-GAAP Reconciliations"" within this Part II, Item 7 for reconciliations of gross operating margin to operating income for each period presented. The following information highlights significant changes in our year-to-year segment results (i.e., gross operating margin amounts) and the primary drivers of such changes. The selected volume statistics presented in the tabular information for each segment are reported on a net basis, taking into account our ownership interests in certain joint ventures, and reflect the periods in which we owned an interest in such operations. These statistics reflect volumes for newly constructed assets from the dates such assets were placed into service. NGL Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Segment gross operating margin: Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities $ 895.0 $ 1,162.0 $ 1,165.4 NGL pipelines, storage and terminals 1,380.9 1,145.7 900.0 NGL fractionation 495.7 570.0 449.0 Total $ 2,771.6 $ 2,877.7 $ 2,514.4 Selected volumetric data: NGL pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 2,700 2,634 2,541 NGL marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 302 258 246 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 826 824 726 Equity NGL production (MBPD) (1) 133 116 126 Fee-based natural gas processing (MMcf/d) (2) 4,905 4,786 4,612 (1) Represents the NGL volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities. (2) Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our gas plants. 79 Table of Contents Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities Comparison of 2015 with 2014 Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2015 decreased $267.0 million when compared to 2014. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants decreased $243.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower processing margins. In addition, gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities for 2015 decreased a net $24.0 million when compared to 2014 primarily due to lower sales margins, which accounted for a $167.4 million decrease, partially offset by a $152.0 million increase due to higher sales volumes. During 2015, a higher percentage of volume in the LPG export business was associated with long-term, fee-based marketing contracts rather than spot business, which is typically contracted at higher margins and was prevalent in 2014. Comparison of 2014 with 2013 Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2014 decreased $3.4 million when compared to 2013. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities for 2014 decreased a net $28.4 million when compared to 2013 primarily due to lower sales margins, which accounted for a $52.9 million decrease, partially offset by a $23.4 million increase due to higher sales volumes, especially for fully-refrigerated, low-ethane propane volumes at our Houston Ship Channel LPG export dock. LPG exports continue to benefit from increased NGL supplies produced from domestic shale plays such as the Eagle Ford Shale and international demand for propane as a feedstock in ethylene plant operations and for power generation and heating purposes. Gross operating margin from our Pioneer natural gas processing plant increased a net $35.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher equity NGL production volumes of 6 MBPD, which accounted for a $42.4 million increase, partially offset by lower processing margins, which accounted for a $12.6 million decrease. Gross operating margin from our South Texas natural gas processing plants increased a net $49.9 million year-to-year primarily due to (i) higher processing fees, which accounted for a $24.8 million increase, (ii) higher fee-based processing volumes of 162 MMcf/d, which accounted for a $13.4 million increase and (iii) higher processing margins, which accounted for a $25.2 million increase. Equity NGL production volumes at our South Texas natural gas processing plants decreased 9 MBPD year-to-year, which resulted in a $14.5 million decrease in gross operating margin. Gross operating margin from our Meeker natural gas processing plant decreased a net $38.0 million year-to-year primarily due to (i) lower processing margins, which accounted for a $19.8 million decrease, (ii) lower equity NGL production volumes of 15 MBPD, which accounted for a $21.9 million decrease, (iii) lower fee based processing volumes of 160 MMcf/d, which accounted for a $9.9 million decrease, partially offset by (iv) higher processing fees, which accounted for a $12.3 million increase. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants in southern Louisiana decreased a net $14.3 million year-to-year primarily due (i) to lower processing margins, which accounted for a $23.6 million decrease, and (ii) lower processing fees, which accounted for a $6.9 million decrease, partially offset by (iii) higher equity NGL production of 7 MBPD, which accounted for an $18.4 million increase. Gross operating margin from our Chaco gas plant decreased $12.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower processing margins, which accounted for a $5.7 million decrease, and higher operating expenses of $8.4 million associated with plant maintenance projects. NGL pipelines, storage and terminals Comparison of 2015 with 2014 Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines, storage and terminal assets for 2015 increased $235.2 million when compared to 2014. Gross operating margin from the Chaparral Pipeline, Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related terminals increased $63.2 million in 2015 when compared to 2014. Higher transportation tariffs and other fees, which accounted for a $66.2 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin, and a $41.1 million year-to-year decrease in operating expenses were partially offset by a $44.1 million decrease in gross operating margin attributable to lower transportation volumes. Transportation volumes on these three pipelines for 2015 decreased a combined 76 MBPD due in part to lower recoveries of ethane when compared to 2014. Lower recoveries of ethane at upstream natural gas processing plants served by these pipelines resulted in lower volumes of ethane available for transportation. 80 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our investments in the Front Range Pipeline, Texas Express Pipeline and Texas Express Gathering System for 2015 increased $17.8 million primarily due to a combined 28 MBPD increase in transportation volumes (net to our interest) when compared to 2014. Gross operating margin from our ATEX and Aegis pipelines increased $18.6 million year-to-year primarily due to a combined 37 MBPD increase in transportation volumes. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System increased $26.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes of 39 MBPD. Lastly, gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage assets increased $14.1 million year-to-year as a result of net operational measurement losses during 2014 that did not reoccur in 2015. Gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel marine terminal and related pipeline increased $78.6 million year-to-year primarily due to (i) increased fee revenues of $41.9 million earned in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the timing of our acquisition of Oiltanking and (ii) $36.7 million due to higher year-to-year marine terminal and pipeline transportation volumes of 47 MBPD and 60 MBPD, respectively. The Houston Ship Channel LPG export terminal continues to earn margin sharing and other fees from our NGL marketing group as it did prior to the Oiltanking acquisition in October 2014. Prior to our acquisition of the terminal, these fees were paid to Oiltanking. Following the acquisition, these fees are charged to our NGL marketing group using intercompany agreements and are reflected in gross operating margin; however, the intercompany amounts are eliminated in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to the $41.9 million year-to-year increase, gross operating margin from this terminal for 2015 reflects a full year of these intercompany fees compared to one quarter in 2014. Comparison of 2014 with 2013 Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines, storage and terminal assets for 2014 increased $245.7 million when compared to 2013. ATEX, which commenced operations in January 2014, contributed $135.6 million of gross operating margin in 2014 and 53 MBPD of transportation volumes. ATEX transports ethane primarily southbound from NGL fractionation plants located in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia to our Mont Belvieu storage complex. The ethane extracted by these fractionation facilities originates from the Marcellus and Utica Shale production areas. Gross operating margin for ATEX for 2014 includes $55.2 million of transportation revenues associated with shipper make-up rights that are deferred under GAAP and not reflected in our consolidated revenues. For additional information regarding the inclusion of deferred revenues in gross operating margin, see ""Other Items – Non-GAAP Reconciliations – Gross Operating Margin"" within this Part II, Item 7. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related NGL terminals increased a net $50.5 million year-to-year. The increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to a $103.9 million increase in transportation revenues attributable to the Rocky Mountain pipeline expansion and higher system-wide tariffs, partially offset by a $27.2 million increase in operating costs (e.g., higher fuel and maintenance costs) and a $26.2 million decrease in revenues attributable to a 47 MBPD decline in transportation volumes. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System increased $18.0 million year-to-year primarily due to a 35 MBPD increase in transportation volumes primarily associated with Eagle Ford Shale production. Gross operating margin from our investments in the Front Range Pipeline, Texas Express Pipeline and Texas Express Gathering System increased $23.9 million year-to-year. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin from these investments includes $7.4 million of transportation revenues associated with shipper make-up rights that are deferred under GAAP and not reflected in our consolidated equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Net to our interest, aggregate transportation volumes on these three pipeline systems were 60 MBPD in 2014. Gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel LPG export marine terminal for the fourth quarter of 2014 includes $19.3 million of intercompany fees earned from providing loading and other services to our NGL marketing group. 81 Table of Contents NGL fractionation Comparison of 2015 with 2014 Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2015 decreased $74.3 million when compared to 2014. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators decreased $62.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower product blending and other fee revenues as a result of lower commodity prices in 2015. Gross operating margin from our Norco NGL fractionator in Louisiana decreased a net $6.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower revenues from product blending and percent-of-liquids contracts attributable to lower energy commodity prices, which accounted for a $13.4 million year-to-year decrease, partially offset by an $8.9 million increase due to higher fractionation volumes of 13 MBPD. Gross operating margin from our Hobbs NGL fractionator in Gaines County, Texas decreased $5.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower fractionation volumes of 8 MBPD. Comparison of 2014 with 2013 Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2014 increased $121.0 million when compared to 2013 primarily due to higher fractionation volumes and fees at our Mont Belvieu complex. NGL fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex increased 108 MBPD year-to-year (net to our ownership interest), which resulted in a $113.2 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin after taking into account associated operating costs. Higher average fractionation and other fees at our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators accounted for an additional $22.8 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin. The year-to-year increase in volumes at our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators is primarily due to an increase in the production of mixed NGLs from domestic shale plays such as the Eagle Ford and other producing regions such as the Rocky Mountains. Crude Oil Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Segment gross operating margin $ 961.9 $ 762.5 $ 742.7 Selected volumetric data: Crude oil pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 1,474 1,278 1,175 Crude oil marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 557 691 210 Comparison of 2015 with 2014 Gross operating margin from our Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for 2015 increased $199.4 million when compared to 2014.

Overall, transportation volumes for the TE Products Pipeline increased a net 48 MBPD year-to-year primarily due to higher intrastate shipments of petrochemicals and refined products in southeast Texas, which accounted for a combined 64 MBPD increase, partially offset by lower interstate transportation volumes for refined products and NGLs of 16 MBPD. Interstate components of the TE Products Pipeline were removed from service during 2013 and repurposed to accommodate the southbound delivery of ethane on our ATEX pipeline, which commenced operations in January 2014. Equity earnings from our investment in Centennial Pipeline LLC increased $9.3 million year-to-year primarily due to its recognition in 2014 of previously deferred revenues. Gross operating margin from providing refined products and petrochemical terminaling services in 2014 was $16.3 million, which included $7.4 million attributable to facilities acquired from Oiltanking. Lastly, gross operating margin from our refined products marketing activities decreased $10.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins. Offshore Pipelines & Services On July 24, 2015, we completed the sale of our Offshore Business, which primarily consisted of our Offshore Pipelines & Services segment. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Offshore Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted). For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Segment gross operating margin $ 97.5 $ 162.0 $ 146.1 Selected volumetric data: Natural gas transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 587 627 678 Crude oil transportation volumes (MBPD) 357 330 307 Platform natural gas processing (MMcf/d) 101 145 202 Platform crude oil processing (MBPD) 13 14 16 Amounts presented for the 2015 period are through the closing date of the sale, July 24, 2015. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2015, we had $4.4 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $4.38 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO's revolving credit facilities and $19.0 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. 86 Table of Contents We expect to issue additional equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital spending. We have a universal shelf registration statement (the ""2013 Shelf"") on file with the SEC. The 2013 Shelf allows Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and EPO (each, on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. The 2013 Shelf will expire in June 2016, at which time we expect to file a replacement universal shelf registration statement. We also have a registration statement on file with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $1.92 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings. Pursuant to this at-the-market (""ATM"") equity issuance program, we may sell common units under an equity distribution agreement between Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and certain broker-dealers from time-to-time by means of ordinary brokers' transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement. After taking into account the aggregate sale price of common units sold under our ATM program through January 31, 2016, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under this program up to an aggregate sales price of $1.64 billion. Consolidated Debt The following table presents scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2015 for the years indicated (dollars in millions): Scheduled Maturities of Debt Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Commercial Paper Notes $ 1,114.1 $ 1,114.1 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- Senior Notes 20,150.0 750.0 800.0 1,100.0 1,500.0 1,500.0 14,500.0 Junior Subordinated Notes 1,474.4 -- -- -- -- -- 1,474.4 Total $ 22,738.5 $ 1,864.1 $ 800.0 $ 1,100.0 $ 1,500.0 $ 1,500.0 $ 15,974.4 In February 2016, we repaid EPO's $750 million Senior Notes AA using available cash, borrowings under our Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under our commercial paper program. The following information describes significant transactions that affected our consolidated debt obligations during the year ended December 31, 2015: Issuance of $2.5 Billion of Senior Notes in May 2015 In May 2015, EPO issued $750 million in principal amount of 1.65% senior notes due May 2018 (""Senior Notes OO""), $875 million in principal amount of 3.70% senior notes due February 2026 (""Senior Notes PP"") and $875 million in principal amount of 4.90% senior notes due May 2046 (""Senior Notes QQ"") using the 2013 Shelf. Senior Notes OO, PP and QQ were issued at 99.881%, 99.635% and 99.635% of their principal amounts, respectively. Net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes were used as follows: (i) the repayment of short-term notes outstanding under EPO's commercial paper program, which included amounts we used to repay $250 million in principal amount of Senior Notes I that matured in March 2015, (ii) the repayment of amounts outstanding at the maturity of our $400 million in principal amount of Senior Notes X that matured in June 2015 and (iii) for general company purposes. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has unconditionally guaranteed these senior notes on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis. These senior notes rank equal with EPO's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and are senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of EPO. These senior notes are subject to make-whole redemption rights and were issued under an indenture containing certain covenants, which generally restrict EPO's ability (with certain exceptions) to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. 87 Table of Contents 364-Day Credit Agreement In September 2015, EPO amended its 364-Day Credit Agreement to extend its maturity date to September 2016. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement. Under the terms of the 364-Day Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $1.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $200 million to $1.7 billion at EPO's election, provided certain conditions are met) at a variable interest rate for a term of 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. To the extent that principal amounts are outstanding, EPO's obligations under the 364-Day Credit Agreement are not secured by any collateral; however, they are guaranteed by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. If any amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement are outstanding at maturity, EPO may elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as a non-revolving term loan for a period of one additional year, payable in September 2017. The 364-Day Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants (affirmative and negative) and events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity date of any amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement. The 364-Day Credit Agreement also restricts EPO's ability to pay cash distributions to its parent, Enterprise Products Partners L.P., if a default or an event of default (as defined in the 364-Day Credit Agreement) has occurred and is continuing at the time such distribution is scheduled to be paid or would result therefrom. Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility In September 2015, EPO amended its Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility to increase its borrowing capacity from $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion and extend its maturity date from June 2018 to September 2020. The amended agreement also provides that EPO may increase its borrowing capacity to $4.5 billion by allowing existing lenders under the facility to increase their respective commitments or by adding one or more new lenders to the facility. Borrowings under this revolving credit facility may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general company purposes. As defined by the credit agreement, variable interest rates charged under this revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. In addition, EPO is required to pay a quarterly facility fee on each lender's commitment irrespective of commitment usage. This revolving credit facility allows us to request up to two one-year extensions of the maturity date, subject to lender approval. The Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility contains certain financial and other customary affirmative and negative covenants. The credit agreement also restricts EPO's ability to pay cash distributions to Enterprise Products Partners L.P. if a default or an event of default (as defined in the credit agreement) has occurred and is continuing at the time such distribution is scheduled to be paid. EPO's borrowings under this revolving credit facility are unsecured general obligations that are guaranteed by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and are non-recourse to Enterprise GP. Partial Retirement of Junior Subordinated Notes During 2015 During 2015, EPO repurchased and retired $28.9 million in principal amount of its Junior Subordinated Notes A and $29.4 million in principal amount of its Junior Subordinated Notes C with cash from operations. A $1.6 million gain on the extinguishment of these debt obligations is included in ""Other, net"" on our Statements of Consolidated Operations. 88 Table of Contents Issuance of Common Units The following table summarizes the issuance of common units in connection with our underwritten equity offerings, ATM program, distribution reinvestment plan (""DRIP"") and employee unit purchase plan (""EUPP"") for the periods indicated (dollars in millions, number of units issued as shown): Number of Common Units Issued Net Cash Proceeds Received Year Ended December 31, 2013: Common units issued in connection with underwritten offerings 36,800,000 $ 1,039.6 Common units issued in connection with ATM program 15,249,378 456.3 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 10,308,254 296.1 Total 62,357,632 $ 1,792.0 Year Ended December 31, 2014: Common units issued in connection with ATM program 1,590,334 $ 57.7 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 9,754,227 331.1 Total 11,344,561 $ 388.8 Year Ended December 31, 2015: Common units issued in connection with ATM program 25,520,424 $ 817.4 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 12,793,913 371.2 Total 38,314,337 $ 1,188.6 The following information describes significant transactions that affected our partners' equity accounts during the year ended December 31, 2015: Completion of Oiltanking Acquisition In February 2015, we issued 36,827,517 common units to the former public unitholders of Oiltanking as a result of completing Step 2 of the Oiltanking acquisition. See ""Significant Recent Developments"" within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information regarding the Oiltanking acquisition. ATM Program During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued 25,520,424 common units under the ATM program for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $825.4 million. This includes 3,225,057 common units sold in March 2015 to a privately held affiliate of EPCO, which generated gross proceeds of $100 million. After taking into account applicable costs, our transactions under the ATM program resulted in aggregate net cash proceeds of $817.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In January 2016, we sold an aggregate 3,830,256 common units under the ATM program to privately held affiliates of EPCO, which generated gross proceeds of $100 million. DRIP and EUPP We also have registration statements on file with the SEC collectively authorizing the issuance of up to 140,000,000 of our common units in connection with our DRIP. The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional new common units. We issued a total of 12,413,351 common units under our DRIP during 2015, which generated net cash proceeds of $359.8 million. This includes the reinvestment of $100 million by privately held affiliates of EPCO that resulted in the issuance of 3,443,631 common units (this amount being a component of the total common units issued under the DRIP in 2015). After taking into account the number of common units issued under the DRIP through December 31, 2015, we had the capacity to issue an additional 15,067,998 common units under this plan. In February 2016, privately held affiliates of EPCO reinvested an additional $100 million, resulting in the issuance of 4,481,504 common units under our DRIP. 89 Table of Contents In addition to the DRIP, we have registration statements on file with the SEC authorizing the issuance of up to 8,000,000 of our common units in connection with our EUPP. We issued 380,562 common units under our EUPP during 2015, which generated net cash proceeds of $11.4 million. After taking into account the number of common units issued under the EUPP through December 31, 2015, we had the capacity to issue an additional 6,772,506 common units under this plan. Use of Proceeds The net cash proceeds we received from the issuance of common units during 2015 were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under EPO's commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities and for general company purposes. For additional information regarding our issuance of common units and related registration statements, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Credit Ratings As of February 26, 2016, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO's long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO's short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor's and P-2 from Moody's. Fitch Ratings issued non-solicited ratings of BBB+ and F-2 for EPO's long-term senior unsecured debt securities and short-term senior unsecured debt securities, respectively. EPO's credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 4,002.4 $ 4,162.2 $ 3,865.5 Cash used in investing activities $ 3,441.8 $ 5,797.9 $ 4,257.5 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (616.0 ) $ 1,653.2 $ 432.8 Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry, which includes gathering, transporting, processing, fractionating and storing natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemical and refined products. As such, changes in the prices of hydrocarbon products and in the relative price levels among hydrocarbon products could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in prices may impact demand for hydrocarbon products, which in turn may impact production, demand and the volumes of products for which we provide services. In addition, decreases in demand may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels. We may also incur credit and price risk to the extent counterparties do not fulfill their obligations to us in connection with our marketing of natural gas, NGLs, propylene, refined products and/or crude oil and long-term take-or-pay agreements. 90 Table of Contents Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a major consideration in our businesses, and our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to sufficiently eliminate customer credit risk. Further, adverse economic conditions in our industry, such as those experienced throughout 2015 and that we continue to experience at the beginning of 2016, increase the risk of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers, particularly customers that have sub-investment grade credit ratings or small-scale companies. Such non-performance risk could be associated with long-term contracts with minimum volume commitments or fixed demand charges. We manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions may utilize letters of credit, prepayments, net out agreements and guarantees. However, these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk. Our primary market areas are located in the Gulf Coast, Southwest, Rocky Mountain, Northeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. We have a concentration of trade receivable balances due from major integrated oil companies, independent oil companies and other pipelines and wholesalers. These concentrations of market areas may affect our overall credit risk in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts: Comparison of 2015 with 2014 Operating Activities Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $159.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: § a $215.1 million year-to-year decrease in cash primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations; and § a $31.7 million decrease in cash attributable to lower partnership income in 2015 compared to 2014 (after adjusting our $275.1 million year-to-year decrease in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); partially offset by § an $87.0 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates generally attributable to our investments in crude oil and NGL pipeline joint ventures. For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see ""Results of Operations"" within this Part II, Item 7. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $2.36 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to: § a $1.46 billion year-to-year increase in cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries primarily due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015, which generated proceeds of $1.53 billion (see ""Significant Recent Developments – Sale of Offshore Business"" under this Part II, Item 7); § a $1.1 billion cash payment in July 2015 (the initial installment) for the acquisition of EFS Midstream compared to an aggregate $2.42 billion cash payment made in October 2014 in connection with Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition; and 91 Table of Contents § a $559.8 million year-to-year decrease in cash contributions to our unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to the completion of construction of the Front Range Pipeline and the Seaway Loop in 2014, partially offset by increased investments in the Eagle Ford Terminals Corpus Christi and Delaware Gas Basin Processing Plant in 2015; partially offset by § a $947.6 million year-to-year increase in capital spending for consolidated property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs (see ""Capital Spending"" within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information regarding our capital spending program); and § an $81.5 million year-to-year change in restricted cash requirements. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $616.0 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.65 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $2.27 billion year-to-year change in cash flow from financing activities was primarily due to: § a $2.81 billion year-to-year decrease in net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements. EPO issued $2.5 billion in senior notes and repaid $1.48 billion in principal amount of debt obligations in 2015 compared to the issuance of $4.75 billion and repayment of $1.15 million in principal amount of senior notes in 2014. In addition, net proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under EPO's commercial paper program were $202.2 million in 2015 compared to $430.6 million in 2014; and § a $305.6 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners in 2015 when compared to 2014. The increase in cash distributions is due to increases in both the number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the quarterly cash distribution rates per unit; partially offset by § a $799.8 million year-to-year increase in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units. Comparison of 2014 with 2013 Operating Activities Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $296.7 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: § a $183.8 million increase in cash attributable to higher partnership income in 2014 compared to 2013 (after adjusting our $226.4 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); and § a $123.5 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to increased earnings from our investments in crude oil and NGL pipeline joint ventures (e.g., our Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System, Texas Express Pipeline, Seaway Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline). For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see ""Results of Operations"" within this Part II, Item 7. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $1.54 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to: § a net $2.42 billion cash payment in October 2014 in connection with Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition; and 92 Table of Contents § an aggregate $135.3 million year-to-year decrease in cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries (see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries); partially offset by § a $518.2 million year-to-year decrease in capital expenditures for consolidated property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs; § a $371.7 million year-to-year decrease in cash contributions to our unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to the completion of construction of the Texas Express Pipeline, SEKCO Oil Pipeline, Front Range Pipeline and Seaway Pipeline looping project, partially offset by increased investments in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System; and § a $126.9 million year-to-year change in restricted cash requirements. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $1.22 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to: § a $2.85 billion year-to-year increase in net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements. EPO issued $4.75 billion and repaid $1.15 billion in principal amount of senior notes in 2014, compared to the issuance of $2.25 billion and repayment of $1.2 billion in principal amount of senior notes in 2013. In addition, net borrowings under EPO's revolving credit facilities and net proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under its commercial paper program increased an aggregate of $303.4 million year-to-year; and § a $196.4 million year-to-year change related to the monetization of interest rate derivative instruments. A $27.6 million gain was recorded in 2014 compared to a $168.8 million loss in 2013; partially offset by § a $1.4 billion year-to-year decrease in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units; § a $237.8 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners in 2014 when compared to 2013. The increase in cash distributions is due to increases in both the number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the quarterly cash distribution rates per unit; and § a $111.4 million year-to-year decrease in cash contributions from noncontrolling interests primarily due to contributions we received during 2013 related to a joint venture involving NGL fractionators at our complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Distributable Cash Flow Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business including, for example, those for capital expenditures, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, commitments and contingencies and other significant amounts. The retention of cash by the partnership allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets. We measure available cash by reference to ""distributable cash flow,"" which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Distributable cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly cash distributions. Distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Our management compares the distributable cash flow we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. 93 Table of Contents Based on the level of available cash, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board of Enterprise GP, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Unlike most master limited partnerships, our general partner has a non-economic ownership interest in us and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from us based on IDRs or other equity interests. Our use of distributable cash flow for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP distributable cash flow to net cash flows provided by operating activities, see ""Other Items – Non-GAAP Reconciliations"" within this Part II, Item 7. The following table summarizes our calculation of distributable cash flow for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Net income attributable to limited partners (1) $ 2,521.2 $ 2,787.4 $ 2,596.9 Adjustments to GAAP net income attributable to limited partners to derive non-GAAP distributable cash flow: Add depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 1,516.0 1,360.5 1,217.6 Add non-cash asset impairment charges 162.6 34.0 92.6 Add loss or subtract gains attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries, net 15.6 (102.1 ) (83.3 ) Add cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries (2) 1,608.6 145.3 280.6 Add changes in fair value of Liquidity Option Agreement (3) 25.4 -- -- Add cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates (4) 462.1 375.1 251.6 Subtract equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates (4) (373.6 ) (259.5 ) (167.3 ) Subtract sustaining capital expenditures (5) (272.6 ) (369.0 ) (291.7 ) Add gains or subtract losses from monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges (6) -- 27.6 (168.8 ) Add deferred income tax expense or subtract benefit, as applicable (20.6 ) 6.1 37.9 Other, net (37.4 ) 73.2 (15.7 ) Distributable cash flow $ 5,607.3 $ 4,078.6 $ 3,750.4 Total cash distributions paid to limited partners with respect to period $ 3,036.8 $ 2,707.6 $ 2,461.9 Cash distributions per unit declared by Enterprise GP with respect to period (7) $ 1.5300 $ 1.4500 $ 1.3700 Total distributable cash flow retained by partnership with respect to period (8) $ 2,570.5 $ 1,371.0 $ 1,288.5 Distribution coverage ratio (9) 1.85x 1.51x 1.52x (1) For a discussion of significant changes in our comparative income statement amounts underlying net income attributable to limited partners, along with the primary drivers of such changes, see ""Consolidated Income Statements Highlights"" within this Part II, Item 7. (2) For a discussion of significant changes in cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries as presented in the investing activities section of our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows, see ""Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities"" within this Part II, Item 7. (3) For information regarding the Liquidity Option Agreement, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (4) For information regarding our unconsolidated affiliates, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (5) For a discussion of our capital spending activity, see ""Capital Spending"" within this Part II, Item 7. For purposes of this calculation, sustaining capital expenditures for each period include the impact of accruals. (6) For information regarding these gains and losses, see ""Interest Rate Hedging Activities"" under Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (7) See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to the periods presented. (8) At the sole discretion of Enterprise GP, cash retained by the partnership with respect to each of these years was primarily reinvested in our growth capital spending program, which substantially reduced our reliance on the equity and debt capital markets to fund such major expenditures. (9) Distribution coverage ratio is determined by dividing distributable cash flow by total cash distributions paid to limited partners and in connection with distribution equivalent rights with respect to the period. 94 Table of Contents Our management compares the distributable cash flow we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net cash flows provided by operating activities. Designated Units Issued in Connection with Holdings Merger In November 2010, we completed our merger with Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. (the ""Holdings Merger""). In connection with the Holdings Merger, a privately held affiliate of EPCO agreed to temporarily waive the regular cash distributions it would otherwise receive from us with respect to a certain number of our common units it owns (the ""Designated Units""). Distributions paid by us to this privately held affiliate of EPCO during 2015 excluded 35,380,000 Designated Units. The temporary distribution waiver expired at the end of calendar year 2015; therefore, distributions to be paid, if any, during calendar year 2016 will include all common units owned by the privately held affiliates of EPCO. Capital Spending An important part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to expand our network of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production resulting from development activities in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, Northeast and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, including the Niobrara, Barnett, Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville, Marcellus and Utica Shale plays. Although our focus in recent years has been on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, asset acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. In light of current business conditions, we expect that these opportunities will increase. Based on total project costs, we placed approximately $2.7 billion of major capital projects into service during 2015. These projects included expansions of our Houston Ship Channel LPG export terminal and the completion of Aegis. We expect to complete construction on an additional $2.7 billion of major capital projects during 2016, including our ethane export terminal, two natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin and various crude oil and refined products infrastructure. We currently expect our total capital spending for the year ended December 31, 2016 to approximate $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion, which includes the $1.0 billion final installment for EFS Midstream and $275 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our forecast of capital spending for 2016 is based on our announced strategic operating and growth plans (through the filing date of this annual report), which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital spending due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather related issues and changes in supplier prices. Furthermore, our forecast of capital spending may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include unforeseen acquisition opportunities. Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a significant factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we expect to make the forecast capital expenditures noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions. 95 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our capital spending for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 EFS Midstream acquisition $ 1,056.5 Oiltanking acquisition: Cash consideration $ 2,416.8 Equity consideration 1,408.7 2,171.5 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net: Growth capital projects (1) 3,540.0 2,502.8 $ 3,088.0 Sustaining capital projects (2) 271.6 361.2 294.2 Investments in unconsolidated affiliates 162.6 722.4 1,094.1 Other investing activities 5.3 5.8 1.0 Total capital spending $ 6,444.7 $ 8,180.5 $ 4,477.3 (1) Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. (2) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. Fluctuations in our spending for growth capital projects and investments in unconsolidated affiliates are explained in large part by increases or decreases in spending on major expansion projects. Our most significant growth capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 involved projects at our Houston LPG and ethane export terminals and Mont Belvieu complex. Fluctuations in spending for sustaining capital projects are explained in large part by the timing and cost of pipeline integrity and similar projects. Comparison of 2015 with 2014 We acquired EFS Midstream in July 2015 for approximately $2.1 billion in cash, excluding $125 million of EFS Midstream debt that was extinguished immediately after closing of the transaction. Of the $2.1 billion purchase price, $1.0 billion was deferred and will be paid no later than the first anniversary of the closing date. For additional information regarding the EFS Midstream acquisition, including an allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Capital spending for 2015 included $1.4 billion of non-cash equity consideration we issued to complete Step 2 of the Oiltanking acquisition. Step 2 represented our acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in Oiltanking; therefore, approximately $1.4 billion of noncontrolling interests attributable to Oiltanking was reclassified to limited partners' equity to reflect the February 2015 issuance of 36,827,517 of our common units. Capital spending for 2014 reflected total cash and equity consideration of approximately $4.6 billion to OTA to complete Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition. For information regarding the Oiltanking acquisition, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. In total, capital spending for property, plant and equipment increased $947.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher growth capital spending during 2015. Growth capital spending at our Mont Belvieu complex increased $385.2 million year-to-year primarily due to construction of the PDH facility, which is expected to begin commercial operations in 2017. Growth capital spending at our Houston Ship Channel LPG and ethane export facilities increased a combined $282.6 million year-to-year. We recently completed expansion projects at our Houston Ship Channel LPG export terminal that increased our ability to load cargoes of fully refrigerated, low-ethane propane to approximately 16.0 MMBbls per month. Work also continues at our Houston Ship Channel ethane export facility, which we expect to begin operations in the third quarter of 2016. 96 Table of Contents Growth capital spending on our natural gas processing and related pipeline projects in the Delaware Basin increased a combined $235.2 million year-to-year. Our South Eddy natural gas processing plant and related pipeline infrastructure are expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, we are constructing and will own an 82-mile NGL pipeline to connect the new Delaware Basin natural gas processing plant to our Chaparral NGL pipeline. We expect this pipeline to begin operations in mid-2016. Growth capital spending on our Rancho II crude oil pipeline, a component of our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System, and the expansion of crude oil terminal assets at our ECHO, Houston Ship Channel and Beaumont Marine West terminals increased a combined $218.2 million year-to-year. The Rancho II crude oil pipeline, which entered commercial service in September 2015, consists of 89 miles of pipeline extending from Sealy, Texas to our ECHO terminal. Current expansion projects at our ECHO, Houston Ship Channel and Beaumont Marine West terminals involve the construction of additional storage capacity and associated distribution pipelines. We continue to complete these terminal expansion projects in phases, with final completion expected in 2016. Growth capital spending on our Gulf Coast ethane header system increased $208.0 million year-to-year. Our Gulf Coast ethane header system extends 500 miles from Corpus Christi, Texas to the Mississippi River in Louisiana and is comprised of the Aegis pipeline and other South Texas midstream infrastructure. Growth capital spending attributable to ATEX and the Rocky Mountain expansion of our Mid-America Pipeline System decreased a combined $264.2 million year-to-year. These two projects were completed during the first quarter of 2015. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates decreased $559.8 million year-to-year primarily due to completion of the Seaway Loop pipeline in December 2014. Comparison of 2014 with 2013 On October 1, 2014, we acquired the general partner and related IDRs, 15,899,802 common units and 38,899,802 subordinated units of Oiltanking from OTA. We paid total consideration of approximately $4.4 billion to OTA comprised of $2.21 billion in cash and 54,807,352 of our common units for these ownership interests and rights. We also paid $228.3 million to acquire from OTA outstanding loans payable by Oiltanking or its subsidiaries. Collectively, these transactions are referred to as ""Step 1"" of the Oiltanking acquisition. In total, capital spending for property, plant and equipment decreased $518.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower growth capital spending during 2014. Capital spending for growth projects in the Eagle Ford Shale and at our Mont Belvieu complex decreased a combined $408.3 million year-to-year. Since 2010, expansion of midstream infrastructure in the Eagle Ford Shale region has been a strategic focus for us. We constructed new NGL, natural gas and crude oil pipelines and the Yoakum natural gas processing plant to facilitate production growth from Eagle Ford Shale producers. Our build-out in this supply basin was substantially complete in 2013. Likewise, we completed and placed into service the seventh and eight NGL fractionators at our Mont Belvieu complex in September 2013 and November 2013, respectively. Growth capital spending for ATEX and Aegis decreased a net $554.1 million year-to-year. ATEX was placed into service in the first quarter of 2014. Growth capital spending for our LPG, ethane and refined products export facilities increased $324.1 million year-to-year. In May 2014, we began loading cargoes of refined products for export at our reactivated marine terminal located in Beaumont, Texas. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates during 2014 decreased $371.7 million when compared to 2013. Our spending on the expansion and construction of joint venture crude oil pipelines decreased a net $106.9 million. Spending related to our construction of the Texas Express Pipeline, Texas Express Gathering System and Front Range Pipeline decreased a combined $262.7 million year-to-year. 97 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following sections discuss the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies: Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset's cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Our estimate of depreciation expense incorporates management assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected residual values, or (iv) significant changes in the forecast life of proved reserves of applicable resource basins, if any. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $32.03 billion and $29.88 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.16 billion, $1.11 billion and $1.01 billion of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals or refined products. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated residual values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset's estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes. An equity method investment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible permanent loss in value of the investment (i.e., other than a temporary decline). Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee's industry. When evidence of a loss in value has occurred, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment's underlying assets. A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. 98 Table of Contents During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $162.6 million, $34.0 million and $92.6 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Amortization Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. The method used to value such assets depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns the asset is expected to generate. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to certain relationships acquired in connection with business combinations and asset purchases whereby (i) we acquired information about or access to customers and now have the ability to provide services to them and (ii) the customers now have the ability to make direct contact with us. Customer relationships may arise from contractual arrangements (such as service contracts) and through means other than contracts, such as through regular contact by sales or service representatives. The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization periods for certain of our customer relationship intangible assets are limited by the estimated finite economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basins. In this context, our estimate of the useful life of each resource basin is predicated on a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. Contract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement and the Jonah natural gas transportation contracts. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a fractionation facility, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements. If our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset's unamortized cost is not recoverable due to impairment, we would be required to reduce the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value through the recording of a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was $4.04 billion and $2.84 billion, respectively. The carrying value of this portfolio increased $1.41 billion in connection with the acquisition of EFS Midstream in July 2015. We recorded $174.1 million, $110.6 million and $105.6 million of amortization expense attributable to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 99 Table of Contents Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is subject to annual impairment testing at the end of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is probable that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Goodwill impairment testing involves determining the fair value of the associated reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the businesses that make up the reporting unit. Such assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the associated businesses, which, in turn, rely on management's estimates of operating margins, throughput volumes and similar inputs; (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond discrete forecast periods; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of a reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a non-cash charge to operating costs and expenses is required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying value of our goodwill was $5.75 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. In October 2014, we recorded $2.22 billion of goodwill in connection with Step 1 of our acquisition of Oiltanking. In addition, we recorded an indefinite-life intangible asset valued at $1.46 billion in connection with the acquisition of Oiltanking's IDRs. The IDRs represented contractual rights to the incentive cash distributions to be paid by Oiltanking to its general partner. Immediately after completion of the Oiltanking Merger in February 2015, the IDRs were cancelled in exchange for limited partner interests in Oiltanking, and the carrying value of this intangible asset was reclassified to goodwill. We attribute the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Oiltanking to our ability to leverage the acquired business with our existing asset base to create future business opportunities. These opportunities include the marketing of NGLs, crude oil, condensate and refined products. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2015, 2014 or 2013. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment test at December 31, 2015, each reporting unit's fair value was substantially in excess of its carrying value (i.e., by at least 10%). For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Revenue Recognition Policies and Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses In general, we recognize revenue from customers when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the buyer's price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. We record revenue when sales contracts are settled (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed). We record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts as required by our established policy. For additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Our use of estimates for certain revenues and expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of our use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for a specific period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. If the assumptions underlying our revenue and expense estimates prove to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. We review our estimates based on currently available information. 100 Table of Contents Other Items Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions): Payment or Settlement due by Period Less than 1-3 4-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1) $ 22,738.5 $ 1,864.1 $ 1,900.0 $ 3,000.0 $ 15,974.4 Estimated cash payments for interest (2) $ 21,734.1 $ 1,053.0 $ 2,011.7 $ 1,777.2 $ 16,892.2 Operating lease obligations (3) $ 494.0 $ 64.2 $ 108.7 $ 85.7 $ 235.4 Purchase obligations: (4) Product purchase commitments: Estimated payment obligations: Natural gas $ 1,160.8 $ 451.3 $ 431.2 $ 217.3 $ 61.0 NGLs $ 376.9 $ 319.3 $ 45.7 $ 11.9 $ -- Crude oil $ 441.5 $ 389.4 $ 35.8 $ 16.3 $ -- Petrochemicals and refined products $ 1,921.4 $ 1,868.6 $ 52.8 $ -- $ -- Other $ 33.2 $ 8.7 $ 11.0 $ 6.8 $ 6.7 Underlying major volume commitments: Natural gas (in TBtus) 647 243 256 118 30 NGLs (in MMBbls) 39 30 7 2 -- Crude oil (in MMBbls) 14 11 2 1 -- Petrochemicals and refined products (in MMBbls) 146 126 20 -- -- Service payment commitments (5) $ 685.9 $ 184.5 $ 251.9 $ 114.8 $ 134.7 Capital expenditure commitments (6) $ 113.9 $ 113.9 $ -- $ -- $ -- Other long-term liabilities (7) $ 411.5 $ -- $ 17.8 $ 4.8 $ 388.9 Total $ 50,111.7 $ 6,317.0 $ 4,866.6 $ 5,234.8 $ 33,693.3 (1) Represents scheduled future maturities of our consolidated debt principal obligations. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2015, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable fixed or variable interest rates paid during 2015. With respect to our variable-rate debt obligations, we applied the weighted-average interest rate paid during 2015 to determine the estimated cash payments. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for the weighted-average variable interest rate charged in 2015 in connection with our commercial paper program. In general, our estimated cash payments for interest are significantly influenced by the long-term maturities of our junior subordinated notes (due August 2066 through January 2068). Our estimated cash payments for interest with respect to each junior subordinated note are based on the current fixed interest rate for each note applied to the entire remaining term through the respective maturity date. (3) Primarily represents land held pursuant to right-of-way agreements and property leases, leases of underground salt dome caverns for the storage of natural gas and NGLs, the lease of transportation equipment used in our operations and office space with affiliates of EPCO. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services as of December 31, 2015. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2015 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Primarily represents our unconditional payment obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts. (6) Represents unconditional payment obligations for services to be rendered or products to be delivered in connection with our capital spending program, including our share of the capital spending of our unconsolidated affiliates. (7) As reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, ""Other long-term liabilities"" primarily represent the Liquidity Option Agreement, the noncurrent portion of asset retirement obligations and deferred revenues. In connection with the agreements to acquire EFS Midstream, we are obligated to spend up to an aggregate of $270 million on specified midstream gathering assets for Pioneer and Reliance, if requested by these producers, over a ten-year period. If constructed, these new assets would be owned by us and be a component of the EFS Midstream System. Due to the uncertain timing of these potential capital expenditures, we have excluded this amount from the preceding table. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 101 Table of Contents Related Party Transactions For information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.

Non-GAAP Reconciliations Gross operating margin The following table presents a reconciliation of non-GAAP total segment gross operating margin to GAAP operating income for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Total segment gross operating margin $ 5,332.1 $ 5,286.5 $ 4,818.1 Adjustments to reconcile total segment gross operating margin to operating income: Subtract depreciation, amortization and accretion expense amounts not reflected in gross operating margin (1,428.2 ) (1,282.7 ) (1,148.9 ) Subtract impairment charges not reflected in gross operating margin (162.6 ) (34.0 ) (92.6 ) Add net gains or subtract net losses attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries not reflected in gross operating margin (15.6 ) 102.1 83.4 Subtract non-refundable deferred revenues attributable to shipper make-up rights on new pipeline projects reflected in gross operating margin (53.6 ) (84.6 ) (4.4 ) Add subsequent recognition of deferred revenues attributable to make-up rights not reflected in gross operating margin 60.7 2.9 -- Subtract general and administrative costs not reflected in gross operating margin (192.6 ) (214.5 ) (188.3 ) Operating income $ 3,540.2 $ 3,775.7 $ 3,467.3 The results of operations from our liquids pipelines are primarily dependent upon the volumes transported and the associated fees we charge for these transportation services. Typically, pipeline transportation revenue is recognized when volumes are transported and delivered. However, under certain pipeline transportation agreements, customers are required to ship a minimum volume over an agreed-upon period. These arrangements typically entail the shipper paying a transportation fee based on a minimum volume commitment, with a provision that allows the shipper to make-up any volume shortfalls over the agreed-upon period (referred to as shipper ""make-up rights""). Revenue attributable to shipper make-up rights is initially deferred and subsequently recognized at the earlier of when the deficiency volume is shipped, when the shipper's ability to meet the minimum volume commitment has expired (typically a one year contractual period), or when the pipeline is otherwise released from its transportation service performance obligation. However, management includes deferred transportation revenues relating to the ""make-up rights"" of committed shippers when reviewing the financial results of certain major new pipeline projects such as ATEX. From an internal (and segment) reporting standpoint, management considers the transportation fees paid by committed shippers on major new pipeline projects, including any non-refundable revenues that may be deferred under GAAP related to make-up rights, to be important in assessing the financial performance of these pipeline assets. Since management includes these deferred revenues in non-GAAP gross operating margin, these amounts are deducted in determining GAAP-based operating income. Our consolidated revenues do not reflect any deferred revenues until the conditions for recognizing such revenues are met in accordance with GAAP. 102 Table of Contents Several of our major new liquids pipeline projects experienced periods where shippers were unable to meet their contractual minimum volume commitments. In general, we expect that these types of shortfalls will continue in 2016 due to the current business environment, with the recognition of revenue associated with past deferrals associated with make-up rights partially or entirely offsetting any new make-up right deferrals. The following table summarizes the deferred revenue amounts attributable to shipper make-up rights included in gross operating margin for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 NGL Pipelines & Services: Texas Express Pipeline (1,2) $ 2.2 $ 3.2 $ 1.3 Front Range Pipeline (1,2) 1.0 5.5 -- ATEX (3) 28.7 55.2 -- Aegis 0.5 0.9 -- Total segment gross operating margin 32.4 64.8 1.3 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services: Seaway Pipeline (1,4) 21.2 19.8 3.1 Total segment gross operating margin 21.2 19.8 3.1 Total amount included in overall gross operating margin $ 53.6 $ 84.6 $ 4.4 (1) Amounts presented represent our ownership share in these unconsolidated affiliates as follows: Texas Express Pipeline, 35%; Front Range Pipeline, 33.3%; and Seaway Pipeline, 50%. (2) Shippers on the Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline have experienced periods where transportation volumes have been less than committed volumes due to ethane rejection in the supply basins served by these pipelines. (3) Shipper transportation volumes on ATEX have been negatively impacted by changes in producer drilling programs, including the timing of new production well start-ups in the Marcellus and Utica Shale developments. (4) Shippers on Seaway's Longhaul System have experienced periods where transportation volumes have been less than committed volumes due to lower regional crude oil price spreads between the Cushing hub and Gulf Coast destination markets. In general, as price spreads decrease, there is less incentive to ship crude oil to the Gulf Coast. The primary reason for the lower spreads is a narrowing of the price differential between WTI and Brent prices.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. General In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps, options and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding and the discount rates used to determine the present values. The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming: § the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk; § the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and § the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period. We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. Accordingly, the nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. Commodity Hedging Activities The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps, basis swaps and option contracts. 104 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2015 (volume measures as noted): Volume (1) Accounting Derivative Purpose Current (2) Long-Term (2) Treatment Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas processing: Forecasted natural gas purchases for plant thermal reduction (Bcf) 9.1 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs (MMBbls) 2.1 n/a Cash flow hedge Natural gas marketing: Forecasted purchases of natural gas for fuel (Bcf) 2.4 n/a Cash flow hedge Natural gas storage inventory management activities (Bcf) 10.7 n/a Fair value hedge NGL marketing: Forecasted purchases of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 28.7 0.4 Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 42.2 0.1 Cash flow hedge Refined products marketing: Forecasted purchases of refined products (MMBbls) 2.7 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of refined products (MMBbls) 0.8 0.1 Cash flow hedge Refined products inventory management activities (MMBbls) 1.3 n/a Fair value hedge Crude oil marketing: Forecasted purchases of crude oil (MMBbls) 15.0 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of crude oil (MMBbls) 17.6 n/a Cash flow hedge Crude oil inventory management activities (MMBbls) 0.7 n/a Fair value hedge Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas risk management activities (Bcf) (3,4) 48.2 8.2 Mark-to-market NGL risk management activities (MMBbls) (4) 1.8 n/a Mark-to-market Crude oil risk management activities (MMBbls) (4) 11.8 n/a Mark-to-market (1) Volume for derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflects the total amount of volumes hedged whereas volume for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflects the absolute value of derivative notional volumes. (2) The maximum term for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is December 2017, January 2017 and March 2018, respectively. (3) Current and long-term volumes include 24.3 Bcf and 2.1 Bcf, respectively, of physical derivative instruments that are predominantly priced at a marked-based index plus a premium or minus a discount related to location differences. (4) Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with transportation, processing and storage assets. At December 31, 2015, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging natural gas processing margins and (iii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory. § The objective of our anticipated future commodity purchases and sales hedging program is to hedge the margins of certain transportation, storage, blending and operational activities by locking in purchase and sale prices through the use of forward contracts and derivative instruments. § The objective of our natural gas processing hedging program is to hedge an amount of gross margin associated with these activities. We achieve this objective by executing forward fixed-price sales of a portion of our expected equity NGL production using forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. For certain natural gas processing contracts, the hedging of expected equity NGL production also involves the purchase of natural gas for plant thermal reduction, which is hedged by executing forward fixed-price purchases using forward contracts and derivative instruments. § The objective of our inventory hedging program is to hedge the fair value of commodity products currently held in inventory by locking in the sales price of the inventory through the use of forward contracts and derivative instruments. 105 Table of Contents The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our natural gas marketing portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2014 December 31, 2015 January 29, 2016 Fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ 5.8 $ 0.1 $ (1.0 ) Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 2.4 (3.7 ) (4.5 ) Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 9.2 3.9 2.4 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our NGL marketing, refined products marketing and octane enhancement portfolios at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2014 December 31, 2015 January 29, 2016 Fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset $ 57.8 $ 69.6 $ 39.5 Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset 47.5 41.7 18.6 Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 68.2 97.4 60.3 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our crude oil marketing portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2014 December 31, 2015 January 29, 2016 Fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset $ 15.6 $ 42.9 $ 29.9 Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset 6.5 25.9 4.9 Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 24.7 60.0 54.9 Interest Rate Hedging Activities We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain consolidated debt agreements. This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. The composition of our derivative instrument portfolios may change depending on our hedging requirements. With respect to the tabular data below, each portfolio's estimated fair value at a given date is based on a number of factors, including the number and types of derivatives outstanding at that date, the notional value of the swaps and associated interest rates. Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps exchange the stated interest rate paid on a notional amount of existing debt for the fixed or floating interest rate stipulated in the derivative instrument.

Overview of Business We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.” We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Our midstream energy operations currently include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and export and import terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases, or “LPG,” and ethane); crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and export and import terminals; petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, export and import terminals, and related services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems. Our assets currently include approximately 49,300 miles of pipelines; 260 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products; and 14 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity. We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the “ASA”) or by other service providers. Our historical operations are reported under five business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, (iv) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services and (v) Offshore Pipelines & Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. On July 24, 2015, we completed the sale of our Gulf of Mexico operations (the “Offshore Business,” which primarily consisted of our Offshore Pipelines & Services segment) to Genesis Energy, L.P. (“Genesis”). Our Offshore Business served drilling and development regions, including deepwater production fields, in the northern Gulf of Mexico offshore Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. These operations included approximately 2,350 miles of offshore natural gas and crude oil pipelines and six offshore hub platforms. Our consolidated financial statements reflect ownership of the Offshore Business through July 24, 2015. For additional information regarding sale of the Offshore Business, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 65 Table of Contents Each of our remaining business segments benefits from the supporting role of our related marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measure, for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. As a result of our acquisition of the member interests of EFS Midstream LLC (“EFS Midstream”) effective July 1, 2015, we began consolidating the financial statements of EFS Midstream as of that date. Significant Recent Developments Plans to Construct Isobutane Dehydrogenation Unit at Mont Belvieu In January 2017, we announced plans to construct a new isobutane dehydrogenation (“iBDH”) unit at our Mont Belvieu complex that is expected to have the capability to produce 425,000 tons per year of isobutylene. The project, which is underwritten by long-term contracts with investment-grade customers, is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. Isobutylene produced by the new plant will provide additional feedstocks for our downstream octane enhancement and petrochemical facilities. Historically, steam crackers and refineries have been the major source of propane and butane olefins for downstream use. However, with the increased use of light-end feedstocks, specifically ethane, the need for on-purpose olefins production has increased. Like our propane dehydrogenation (“PDH”) facility, the iBDH plant will help meet market demand where traditional supplies have been reduced. The new iBDH plant will increase our production of both high purity and low purity isobutylene, both of which are used primarily as feedstock to manufacture lubricants, rubber products and alkylate for gasoline blendstock, as well as methyl tertiary butyl ether for export. Completion of Ethane Export Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel In September 2016, we placed our ethane export terminal located at Morgan’s Point on the Houston Ship Channel (the “Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal”) into commercial service, and the terminal loaded its first vessel bound for Europe with 265,000 barrels of ethane. The Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, which is the largest of its kind in the world, has an aggregate loading rate (nameplate capacity) of approximately 10,000 barrels per hour of fully refrigerated ethane. Supply for the Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal is sourced from our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation and storage complex and transported through a new 18-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline that we completed in February 2016. The Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal supports growing international demand for abundant U.S. ethane from shale plays, which offers the global petrochemical industry a low-cost feedstock option and supply diversification. By providing producers with access to the export market, the Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal is also facilitating continued development of U.S. energy reserves. Start-Up of Delaware Basin Gas Processing Plant In August 2016, construction of our joint venture-owned Delaware Basin cryogenic natural gas processing plant (referred to as the “Waha” plant) was completed, and the facility was placed into service. The Waha plant, the construction of which is supported by long-term contracts, has a natural gas processing capacity of 150 MMcf/d and is able to extract in excess of 22 MBPD of NGLs. The plant is located in Reeves County, Texas and was designed to accommodate the growing production of NGL-rich natural gas from the Delaware Basin. We own a 50% equity interest in the joint venture that owns the Waha plant, which we operate. 66 Table of Contents In conjunction with the completion of the construction of the Waha plant, we completed construction of an 82-mile, 12-inch diameter pipeline that connects the Waha plant to our Chaparral Pipeline system, which transports mixed NGLs from natural gas processing plants in West Texas and New Mexico to our NGL fractionation and storage complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Our Texas Intrastate System provides transportation services for natural gas processed at the Waha plant. Addition of Propylene Export Capability at our Houston Ship Channel terminal In July 2016, we initiated polymer grade propylene (“PGP”) loading services at our Enterprise Hydrocarbons Terminal (“EHT,” formerly known as our “Houston Ship Channel LPG export terminal”), which is located on the Houston Ship Channel. We are expecting an increase in the number of PGP export cargoes in response to international demand. We now have the capability to load 5,000 metric tons per day of refrigerated PGP at the EHT dock facilities, which are directly supplied by propylene fractionators and storage wells at our Mont Belvieu, Texas complex. Final Payment for EFS Midstream Acquisition In July 2015, we purchased EFS Midstream from affiliates of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (“PXD”) and Reliance Industries Limited (“Reliance”) for approximately $2.1 billion, which was payable in two installments. The initial payment of $1.1 billion was paid at closing on July 8, 2015. The second and final installment of $1.0 billion was paid on July 11, 2016 using a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program. Expansion of Delaware Basin Network with New Natural Gas Processing Plant In June 2016, we announced plans to build an additional cryogenic natural gas processing plant and associated pipeline infrastructure in the Delaware Basin. The new processing plant will be located near Orla, Texas in Reeves County and have a natural gas processing capacity of 300 MMcf/d and the capability to extract more than 40 MBPD of NGLs. In addition, the project includes construction of natural gas gathering lines that will supply the plant, a pipeline that will deliver residue gas to markets at the Waha hub, and an extension of our Mid-America Pipeline System that will provide Orla customers with NGL takeaway capacity. The facility and related pipeline infrastructure, all of which we will own and operate, are expected to begin service in the second quarter of 2018. The project is anchored by long-term commitments from a major producer. Start-Up of South Eddy Natural Gas Processing Plant In May 2016, we announced that our new cryogenic natural gas processing plant located in Eddy County, New Mexico (the “South Eddy” plant) had been placed into service. We constructed the South Eddy plant to serve producers in the Delaware Basin region. The South Eddy plant has a nameplate natural gas processing capacity of 200 MMcf/d and is capable of extracting up to 25 MBPD of NGLs. We also completed construction of approximately 90 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines to supply the new plant. In addition to the South Eddy plant and its related natural gas gathering infrastructure, we also completed a 71-mile extension of our Mid-America Pipeline System. This extension provides producers in the Delaware Basin with NGL takeaway capacity and direct access to our integrated network of NGL assets. 67 Table of Contents General Outlook for 2017 Commercial Outlook General Commodity Price Observations As a result of significant advances in non-conventional drilling and production technology, North American reserves and production of hydrocarbons, primarily from shale resource basins such as the Eagle Ford in South Texas, the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Appalachia Basin in the Northeast U.S., increased substantially in recent years. The increase in U.S. hydrocarbon supplies led to a reduction in imports of crude oil, NGLs, refined products and natural gas into the U.S. Conversely, this trend has resulted in significant increases in hydrocarbon exports from the U.S., particularly of refined products and LPGs. In light of weaker global economic growth (especially in Europe and China) and in the face of increasing production from North America and certain countries in the Middle East and Africa, global production and inventories of hydrocarbons (particularly crude oil and refined products) began to exceed demand in 2014. In response to the growing supplies, beginning in November 2014, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”), opted to defend its market share by maintaining (and in some cases increasing) its crude oil production levels rather than cutting production to balance global markets. The result was a dramatic decline in global crude oil prices from an average of $93 per barrel in 2014, to $49 per barrel in 2015 and further to $43 per barrel in 2016, as measured by the price of West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”). Prices reached a low of approximately $26 per barrel in February 2016, but have since recovered to over $50 per barrel beginning in December 2016 and into early 2017. Likewise, as a result of excess domestic supplies and a warm winter in 2015-2016, natural gas prices have also experienced significant weakness in recent years. As measured at Henry Hub, natural gas prices declined from an average of $4.43 per MMBtu in 2014, to $2.67 per MMBtu in 2015 and further to $2.46 per MMBtu in 2016. Natural gas prices at Henry Hub fell to a low of $1.64 per MMBtu in March 2016, but have since rebounded to approximately $3.00 per MMBtu in February 2017. In response to lower energy commodity prices, domestic producers significantly reduced both their drilling and completion activities in most production basins starting in early 2015. As a result of reduced drilling, domestic crude oil production at the end of 2016 was 840 MBPD lower than at its peak in June 2015; however, production of natural gas and NGLs has been relatively stable during this volatile price environment. While market sentiment on crude oil prices had generally been negative since the winter of 2014, OPEC members discussed an output “freeze” in September 2016 to try to balance the market and reduce excess crude oil inventories. These discussions caused crude oil prices to stabilize and start increasing. In November 2016, OPEC members formally agreed to production cuts, starting January 1, 2017, that will be in effect until at least the next OPEC meeting scheduled in May 2017. In addition to OPEC members, certain non-OPEC producers such as Russia agreed to participate in the production cuts, which has further strengthened crude oil and related energy commodity prices. In addition to the OPEC-led production cuts, many industry experts expect that strong consumer demand for energy and related products due to the lower prices (combined with routine supply disruptions) will accelerate rebalancing of the global oil market, with daily demand exceeding supply as early as the second half of 2017. With the announced cuts and positive supply and demand trends, the forward markets and most industry experts currently forecast that WTI will trade in the $50 to $60 per barrel range between now and 2020. 68 Table of Contents Supply Side Observations Due to lower global energy commodity prices, plans for longer lead time, capital intensive projects continue to be delayed (or in some instances cancelled) by exploration and production companies (“E&P”) as they continue to shift their focus to shorter lead time and less risky projects. We believe that projects in U.S. shale resource basins exhibit this low risk, short lead time production profile, and that U.S. shale resources will continue to play an increasing role in both domestic and global markets. The ongoing impact of U.S. shale production is evident globally as both OPEC members and non-OPEC producers such as Russia adjust their national budgets to deal with the new realities of lower revenues from energy exports and heightened competition from non-conventional resources in the U.S. and Canada. Many energy economists also believe that outside of some limited excess production capacity within OPEC, U.S. shale production is now the world’s swing crude oil supply. Since this energy cycle began, the effects of lower energy prices have been widespread throughout the energy industry resulting in lower investment to drill and complete wells, personnel layoffs and a total of 240 E&P, oilfield service and midstream companies filing for bankruptcy. To preserve capital, certain E&P companies deferred well completions known as drilled but uncompleted wells (“DUCs”). Also during this period, oilfield service and E&P companies developed better technologies to drill and complete non-conventional wells more efficiently. Some of these improvements include reductions in days to drill wells, longer horizontal laterals, and fracturing formations at higher pressures. Improved technology has enabled E&P companies to realize higher returns on capital from developing non-conventional resources at lower energy prices. While changes in drilling rig counts (as reported by Baker Hughes) have historically been a reliable leading indicator of future production growth or decline, recent developments in technology, high grading of drilling locations and the large inventory of DUCs have reduced the correlation between changes in rig counts and changes in production. We believe this to be especially true when comparing current rig counts to those prior to 2015. Rig counts continue, however, to be a good indicator of overall E&P activity and investment. U.S. E&P company sentiment has improved over the last few months and indications are that their production budgets for 2017 reflect increased activity when compared to the lows experienced in 2016. Since May 2016, total U.S. drilling rig counts have increased over 330 rigs, or 83%, to 741 rigs as of February 2017. The crude oil rig count increased by 275 to 591 rigs, an increase of approximately 87% from the low in May 2016. Likewise, the natural gas rig count increased by 68 rigs, or approximately 84%, from the low in August 2016. Not all regions have reacted equally to the recovery in rig counts. Permian outlook The Permian Basin in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico has experienced the largest increase in drilling activity, with the number of active rigs increasing to 301 in February 2017 from 134 in April 2016. The Permian Basin is an oil prone basin with many attributes, including stacked pay zones, light sweet crude and a long history of support for the oil and gas industry. The current level of producer activity provides support for the construction of incremental midstream infrastructure in the basin. An area of focus for us has been the development of midstream infrastructure serving producers in the Delaware Basin, which is part of the overall Permian Basin. During 2016, we completed and placed into service two natural gas processing facilities (South Eddy and Waha) and announced plans for construction of a third facility (Orla) in the Delaware Basin. In addition, we are developing a major crude oil pipeline system, the Midland-to-ECHO Pipeline System, that would serve producers in the Permian Basin and originate at our Midland, Texas crude oil terminal and extend to our Sealy terminal and on to our ECHO terminal near Houston, Texas. We are also evaluating several other natural gas and crude oil projects in the Permian Basin. 69 Table of Contents Eagle Ford outlook Rig counts in the Eagle Ford shale region have been significantly impacted by the downturn in oil prices. While the number of active drilling rigs in the Eagle Ford shale has increased by 29 rigs, or 103%, to 57 rigs in February 2017 from the low recorded in May 2016, we do not believe this level of activity is high enough to offset natural production declines in the region. The historical peak for Eagle Ford crude oil and natural gas production occurred in March 2015 and was 1.6 million barrels per day and 6.0 Bcf/d, respectively. The most recent data for Eagle Ford production was 1.0 million barrels per day of crude oil and 4.9 Bcf/d of natural gas. Until volumes for the Eagle Ford return to near historical peak production, there is excess capacity of midstream infrastructure available in the region. We still believe that the Eagle Ford offers producers some of the best returns on capital of any region in the country and is also favorably situated near growing consumption and export markets on the U.S. Gulf Coast. We also believe that a significant amount of production and acreage in the Eagle Ford could change ownership in the near future and that such a change in ownership would be supportive of an increase in rig activity and production. Haynesville outlook The rig count in the Haynesville shale region has increased recently as ownership of large parcels of producing acreage has changed hands. The rig count for February 2017 is 30, which represents a 19 rig increase from the low of 11 rigs recorded in February 2016. Drilling in the Haynesville has benefitted from technological advances, which have improved natural gas recoveries per well and resulted in better returns on capital. With natural gas futures prices currently at approximately $3.00 per MMBtu, we believe Haynesville natural gas production has reached its low point, and that volumes will begin to gradually increase in 2017. Haynesville production peaked in November 2011 at approximately 7.8 Bcf/d and is currently 3.9 Bcf/d. Until Haynesville volumes return to near historical peak production, there is excess capacity of midstream infrastructure available in the region. Rockies outlook Rig counts have increased in both the Piceance basin and the Jonah and Pinedale fields, although rig counts are still at depressed levels. Drilling activity in the Piceance basin increased from 2 rigs in May 2016 to 5 rigs in February 2017, and in the Jonah and Pinedale fields increased from a combined 4 rigs in November 2016 to 8 rigs in February 2017. Furthermore, drilling activity in the San Juan basin declined from 2 rigs in November 2015 to 1 rig in February 2017. Current rig counts in these producing regions will not be enough to offset natural production declines; however, since the natural gas produced from these areas is often rich in NGL content, the recent increase in NGL prices may spur increased drilling activity in these regions. In addition, drilling economics in these regions should benefit as enhanced completion technologies now being employed in the Gulf Coast and Midcontinent areas become more widespread in the Western Rockies, thus increasing returns on incremental capital invested. The Rockies benefit from adequate natural gas and NGL pipeline infrastructure, resulting in favorable netback prices, which help the region compete with other North American plays where takeaway capacity may be constrained. Like in other areas, higher energy prices could encourage changes in ownership by producers, which could also improve rig counts. As a result of higher energy commodity prices in the past few months and continued positive sentiment towards price stability, we expect an increase in producer investment and drilling activity in and around our assets in the Permian, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Rockies regions. Furthermore, we expect that our assets in these areas are going to be very competitive in supplying services for the resulting new production. We also believe that basins located closest to prime markets on the U.S. Gulf Coast will be preferred by producers due to more favorable economics as compared to other more distant areas (mostly due to lower transportation costs). Demand Side Observations Overall demand for petroleum products continues to increase at rates that have generally exceeded economists’ expectations. We believe the U.S. is very well situated to meet growing global petroleum demand. With the recent improvement in crude oil prices, the U.S Energy Information Administration reports that U.S. crude oil production has started to increase. As U.S. crude oil production recovers, we expect that some of these new domestic barrels will supplant more of the country’s crude oil imports. We also expect U.S. refineries to operate at higher utilization rates as a result of strong U.S. motor fuels demand and growing global demand. In addition, as U.S. crude oil supplies increase, we also expect crude oil exports to grow, with likely markets being Central and South America, Asia and Western Europe where the lighter U.S. crudes make good feedstocks for their refining facilities. 70 Table of Contents In December 2015, the U.S. government lifted its ban on exporting domestically produced crude oil. We believe that this should be beneficial to the domestic energy industry in general and to Enterprise in particular. Our marine terminal assets and related infrastructure are strategically located on the U.S. Gulf Coast. These assets could benefit from concurrent imports and exports of various grades of crude oil as (i) refineries optimize their crude oil input slate, (ii) trading companies import and export different grades of crude oil depending on global and regional supply-demand factors, and (iii) producers optimize their production depending on market price signals. With significant crude oil export capabilities at Freeport, Texas City, on the Houston Ship Channel and at Beaumont, Texas, lifting of the export ban should have a beneficial impact on our crude oil pipeline, storage and marine terminal assets (without any significant capital expenditure). However, this outlook could be muted if there is a prolonged decline in domestic crude oil drilling and production, or if overseas crude markets become oversupplied for an extended period and thus discounted from a price standpoint when compared to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Furthermore, as several new world scale ethylene plants begin operations in the U.S. through the early 2020s, we expect growing domestic demand for ethane, which could in turn drive upstream NGL production increases supported by producer investment and higher rig counts. We also expect that global demand for heavier NGLs (butanes and natural gasoline) will continue to increase supported by rising global economic activity. With respect to natural gas demand, we expect it to continue to increase in the form of U.S. power generation demand, growing industrial demand, exports to Mexico and as liquefied natural gas, or LNG. We believe U.S. producers can provide ample supplies of natural gas at very competitive prices to meet growing global demand. In recent years, U.S. natural gas and NGLs developed a feedstock price advantage over more costly crude oil derivatives (such as naphtha and Gasoil). In general, we expect this trend to continue due to: (i) competitive domestic production from low risk, short lead time shale resource plays; (ii) the ability of U.S. producers and their suppliers to harness technology to keep costs down; (iii) anticipated long-term increases in demand for crude oil by developing economies; and (iv) ongoing geopolitical risks and poor rule of law in many areas of the world that are major exporters of crude oil, which may cause unexpected disruptions, and crude oil price increases. These advantages lend themselves to a variety of long-term demand-side opportunities, including higher demand from the U.S. petrochemical industry and increased exports of various hydrocarbons (e.g., LNG, LPG, ethane and crude oil). We also believe the trend in the feedstock price advantage of domestically-produced NGLs and their abundance has led to a long-term fundamental change in feedstock selection by the U.S. petrochemical industry, which is the largest consumer of domestic NGLs. In order to capitalize on this cost advantage, U.S. petrochemical companies have maximized their consumption of domestic NGLs. Many of these companies are investing billions of dollars to construct world-scale ethylene plants on the Gulf Coast that are designed to consume NGLs (particularly ethane) as feedstock. U.S. ethylene production capacity is expected to increase by over 40% over the next 3 years. Below is a list of ethylene plants under construction that are scheduled to begin operations over the next few years based on publicly available information. Company Ethylene Production Capacity Potential Ethane Consumption Estimated Completion Date (Billion lbs/yr) (MBPD) Occidental Chemical/Mexichem 1.2 33 2017 Chevron Phillips Chemical 3.3 90 2017 ExxonMobil Chemical 3.3 90 2017 Dow Chemical 3.3 90 2017 Indorama 1.1 30 2017 Shintech 1.1 30 2018 Sasol 3.3 90 2018 Formosa Plastics 3.5 95 2019 Axiall/Lotte 2.2 60 2019 Total Petrochemicals & Refining 2.2 60 2019 Shell 3.5 95 Early 2020s Total 28.0 763 71 Table of Contents Additionally, several other petrochemical companies have announced significant expansions and/or conversions at existing facilities that will use ethane as a feedstock. Almost all of these ethylene plants and the ethylene industry’s major expansions are in close proximity to our existing or planned assets, including our recently completed Aegis Ethane Pipeline. Based on industry publications, domestic production of ethylene in 2015 and 2016 averaged 155 million pounds per day compared to an average of 145 million pounds per day for the five-year period ending in 2014. Ethane is the most widely used feedstock by the U.S. petrochemical industry in the production of ethylene. As a result, ethane consumption by domestic petrochemical companies has, at times, been in excess of 1.2 MMBPD. We believe the U.S. ethylene industry could consume approximately 200 MBPD of additional ethane feedstocks over the next few years through modifications, debottlenecking and expansions at existing facilities. In addition, we believe that publicly announced new petrochemical plant construction projects, including those noted in the preceding table could consume well over 700 MBPD of additional ethane feedstocks when completed. However, until these new ethylene plants are completed, ethane production capacity continues to exceed demand, resulting in significant volumes of ethane not being extracted from the natural gas stream by producers and natural gas processors in an effort to balance ethane supply with demand. We also expect exports of domestically produced ethane will increase in the coming years. Our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, which we placed into service in September 2016, supports growing international demand for abundant U.S. ethane from shale plays and offers the global petrochemical industry a low-cost feedstock option and supply diversification. The Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, which is located on the Houston Ship Channel and is the largest of its kind in the world, has an aggregate loading rate (nameplate capacity) of approximately 10,000 barrels per hour of fully refrigerated ethane and is integrated with our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation and storage complex. U.S. exports of fully refrigerated LPG continue to increase as a result of ample domestic production, increased export capacity and competitive, transparent pricing when compared to international markets. Overall, U.S. propane waterborne exports increased from approximately 423 MBPD in 2014 to approximately 875 MBPD in 2016. Markets in Asia and Central and South America have been the major sources of new demand for U.S. LPG exports; however, growing volumes are also being transported to Northwest Europe. LPG exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Central and South America are expected to increase in the future as these economies continue to grow. Furthermore, we expect that increased volumes of Gulf Coast-sourced LPGs will be exported in the coming years to Asian markets due to faster growth of these economies and the widening of the Panama Canal, which was completed in 2016. In anticipation of the aforementioned growth in LPG exports, we completed the final phase of the expansion of our LPG export terminal located on the Houston Ship Channel at EHT in December 2015. This expansion increased our loading rate for LPG at the terminal to approximately 27,500 barrels per hour (nameplate capacity). Lastly, we believe that natural gas prices will stabilize at around $3.00/MMBtu as U.S. supply and demand fundamentals for this commodity become more balanced through exports and incremental demand from industrial customers and for power generation. Supply basins with dry natural gas, such as the Haynesville/Bossier, Barnett, Fayetteville, Piceance and Jonah/Pinedale shales, could experience an increase in drilling activity due to their low development costs. The Haynesville resource basin is an excellent example of a dry gas production area that we believe could experience a substantial increase in drilling activity since it is ideally located to serve future demand from LNG exports and industrial customers on the U.S. Gulf Coast. 72 Table of Contents Summary While this period of very low prices has been very difficult for producers, the lower energy commodity prices have led to an increase in energy consumption by individual consumers, particularly for motor fuels, and by energy intensive industries (e.g., steel manufacturing and petrochemicals) as lower energy and feedstock costs reduce the operating costs for such businesses and in some instances make them more competitive globally. We believe that an increase in demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs from these types of industries, along with other positive consumer-driven demand responses to lower energy prices, will continue to balance crude oil supply and demand fundamentals to the extent that current excess inventories begin to decline in 2017. Regardless of such market dynamics, almost all of the major assets we have under construction or have recently completed, whether supply or demand oriented, are supported by long-term fee-based commitments from producers, shippers and/or end-use customers. We also believe that as a result of the price downturn which has slowed and/or caused many higher-risk, long-lead time projects to be cancelled, U.S. unconventional resources have gained substantial long-term significance worldwide. Liquidity Outlook Debt and equity capital markets for the energy sector were turbulent throughout 2016 as continued volatility and weakness in commodity prices created market uncertainty. This has generally impacted both the cost of capital and access to debt and equity capital markets. While there were challenges in the capital markets during 2016, we were able to access both the debt and equity capital markets to support our growth and balance sheet objectives at acceptable costs. At December 31, 2016, we had $3.78 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $3.72 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $63.1 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations, access to capital markets and access to bank capital to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. We have $800 million in principal amount of senior notes maturing in September 2017. We expect to refinance this series of senior notes obligation at or near to its maturity. Our next maturing series of senior notes are due in April and May of 2018 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion. The U.S. government is expected to continue to run substantial annual budget deficits in the coming years that will require a corresponding issuance of debt by the U.S. Treasury. The interest rate on U.S. Treasury debt has a direct impact on the cost of our debt. At this time, we are uncertain what impact the expected large issuances of U.S. Treasury debt and the prevailing economic and capital market conditions during these future periods will have on the cost and availability of capital. To that end, we have entered into $275 million of notional forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our expected future debt issuances in connection with the refinancing of debt in 2018. We continue to monitor and evaluate the condition of the capital markets and our interest rate risk with respect to funding our capital spending program and refinancing upcoming maturities. 73 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table summarizes the key components of our results of operations for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Revenues $ 23,022.3 $ 27,027.9 $ 47,951.2 Costs and expenses: Operating costs and expenses: Cost of sales 15,710.9 19,612.9 40,464.1 Other operating costs and expenses 2,425.6 2,449.4 2,541.8 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 1,456.7 1,428.2 1,282.7 Net losses (gains) attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries (2.5 ) 15.6 (102.1 ) Asset impairment and related charges 52.8 162.6 34.0 Total operating costs and expenses 19,643.5 23,668.7 44,220.5 General and administrative costs 160.1 192.6 214.5 Total costs and expenses 19,803.6 23,861.3 44,435.0 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 362.0 373.6 259.5 Operating income 3,580.7 3,540.2 3,775.7 Interest expense (982.6 ) (961.8 ) (921.0 ) Change in fair market value of Liquidity Option Agreement (24.5 ) (25.4 ) -- Other, net 2.8 2.9 1.9 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (23.4 ) 2.5 (23.1 ) Net income 2,553.0 2,558.4 2,833.5 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (39.9 ) (37.2 ) (46.1 ) Net income attributable to limited partners $ 2,513.1 $ 2,521.2 $ 2,787.4 The following table presents each business segment’s contribution to consolidated revenues (net of eliminations) for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 NGL Pipelines & Services: Sales of NGLs and related products $ 8,380.5 $ 8,044.8 $ 15,460.1 Midstream services 1,862.0 1,743.2 1,629.7 Total 10,242.5 9,788.0 17,089.8 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services: Sales of crude oil 5,802.5 9,732.9 19,783.9 Midstream services 712.5 573.0 400.4 Total 6,515.0 10,305.9 20,184.3 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services: Sales of natural gas 1,591.9 1,722.6 3,181.7 Midstream services 951.1 1,020.7 1,022.1 Total 2,543.0 2,743.3 4,203.8 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services: Sales of petrochemicals and refined products 2,921.9 3,333.5 5,575.5 Midstream services 799.9 778.4 741.0 Total 3,721.8 4,111.9 6,316.5 Offshore Pipelines & Services: Sales of natural gas -- -- 0.3 Sales of crude oil -- 3.2 8.6 Midstream services -- 75.6 147.9 Total -- 78.8 156.8 Total consolidated revenues $ 23,022.3 $ 27,027.9 $ 47,951.2 74 Table of Contents Substantially all of our consolidated revenues are earned in the U.S. and derived from a wide customer base. Our largest non-affiliated customer for 2016 was Vitol Holding B.V. and its affiliates (collectively, “Vitol”), which accounted for 9.9% of our consolidated revenues.

(3) PGP prices represent average contract pricing for such product as reported by IHS Chemical, a division of IHS Inc. (“IHS Chemical”). Refinery grade propylene prices represent weighted-average spot prices for such product as reported by IHS Chemical. (4) Crude oil prices are based on commercial index prices for WTI as measured on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) and for LLS as reported by Platts. Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices. Energy commodity prices fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including supply and demand imbalances and geopolitical tensions. Crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been depressed since the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to an oversupply of these commodities on world markets. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.50 per gallon in 2016 versus $0.49 per gallon in 2015 and $0.97 per gallon in 2014. A decrease in our consolidated marketing revenues due to lower energy commodity sales prices may not result in a decrease in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also be lower due to comparable decreases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same correlation would be true in the case of higher energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs. 75 Table of Contents We attempt to mitigate commodity price exposure through our hedging activities as well as through converting keepwhole and similar contracts to fee-based arrangements. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities. Consolidated Income Statement Highlights The following information highlights significant changes in our comparative income statement amounts and the primary drivers of such changes. Comparison of 2016 with 2015 Revenues Total revenues for 2016 decreased $4.01 billion when compared to total revenues for 2015. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil decreased $3.93 billion year-to-year due to lower sales volumes and prices, which accounted for a $2.77 billion decrease and a $1.16 billion decrease, respectively. Revenues from the marketing of natural gas, petrochemicals, refined products and octane additives decreased a net $513.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $760.0 million decrease, partially offset by a $246.2 million increase due to higher sales volumes. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs increased a net $335.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $956.2 million increase, partially offset by a $620.5 million decrease due to lower sales prices. Revenues from midstream services increased a net $134.6 million year-to-year primarily due to the ongoing expansion of our operations. Revenues increased $144.5 million year-to-year from the assets we acquired in the EFS Midstream acquisition in July 2015. Revenues from midstream services decreased $76.0 million year-to-year due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015. The remaining $66.1 million year-to-year increase in revenues from midstream services is primarily due to contractual increases in committed volumes on pipeline assets, such as ATEX and the Aegis Ethane Pipeline (“Aegis”), and the expansion of storage capacity at our terminal assets on the Gulf Coast. Operating costs and expenses Total operating costs and expenses for 2016 decreased $4.03 billion when compared to total operating costs and expenses for 2015. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil decreased $3.69 billion year-to-year due to lower sales volumes and prices, which accounted for a $2.53 billion decrease and a $1.16 billion decrease, respectively. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of natural gas, petrochemicals, refined products and octane additives decreased a net $416.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $666.1 million decrease, partially offset by a $250.0 million increase due to higher sales volumes. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs increased a net $206.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $754.2 million increase, partially offset by lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $547.7 million decrease. Other operating costs and expenses decreased a net $23.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower maintenance expenses during 2016 when compared to 2015. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses for 2016 increased a net $28.5 million when compared to 2015. A $112.8 million year-to-year increase primarily due to assets we recently constructed and placed into service or acquired was partially offset by an $84.3 million decrease attributable to the sale of our Offshore Business. 76 Table of Contents Operating costs and expenses also include $52.8 million and $162.6 million of non-cash asset impairment and related charges for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Non-cash asset impairment charges for 2016 primarily relate to the planned abandonment of plant and pipeline assets in Texas and New Mexico. Related charges for 2016 include a $7.1 million non-cash write-off for assets damaged in a fire at our Pascagoula, Mississippi natural gas processing facility in June 2016. In 2015, we recorded a $54.8 million asset impairment charge in connection with our sale of the Offshore Business. The remainder of our non-cash asset impairment charges for 2015 primarily relate to natural gas processing assets in southern Louisiana, certain marine vessels and the abandonment of certain crude oil and natural gas pipeline assets in Texas. General and administrative costs General and administrative costs for 2016 decreased $32.5 million when compared to 2015 primarily due to lower costs for employee compensation and professional services. General and administrative costs for 2016 include $0.7 million of non-cash asset impairment charges. Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2016 decreased a net $11.6 million when compared to 2015. Results for 2015 reflect $46.6 million of equity earnings attributable to the Offshore Business sold in July 2015. This year-to-year decrease was partially offset by a net $30.5 million increase in earnings from our investments in crude oil pipelines, which benefited from the settlement of a rate case by Seaway during 2016. Operating income Operating income for 2016 increased $40.5 million when compared to 2015 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Interest expense Interest expense for 2016 increased $20.8 million when compared to 2015. The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 1,088.9 $ 1,063.4 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization 30.5 15.4 Interest cost capitalized in connection with construction projects (1) (168.2 ) (149.1 ) Other (2) 31.4 32.1 Total $ 982.6 $ 961.8 (1) We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital spending levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. (2) Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is the primary driver of interest expense, increased a net $25.5 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2016, which accounted for a $54.8 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates in 2016, which accounted for a $29.3 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2016 was $23.41 billion compared to $22.24 billion for 2015. In general, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital spending program. For a discussion of our consolidated debt obligations and capital spending program, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Capital Spending” within this Part II, Item 7 of this annual report. 77 Table of Contents Change in fair market value of Liquidity Option Agreement We recognized a decrease of $0.9 million of aggregate non-cash expense attributable to accretion and changes in management estimates regarding inputs to the valuation model for the Liquidity Option Agreement. For information regarding the Liquidity Option Agreement, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Income taxes Income taxes primarily reflects our state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (“Texas Margin Tax”). Our provision for income taxes for 2016 increased $25.9 million when compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in accruals for the Texas Margin Tax. In June 2015, the State of Texas lowered the tax rate under the Texas Margin Tax, which resulted in an income tax benefit for us in 2015. Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased a net $2.7 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. A $7.8 million year-to-year decrease in net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in Oiltanking for the period January 1, 2015 to February 13, 2015, which is the date we completed the Oiltanking acquisition, was more than offset by a net $10.5 million year-to-year increase attributable to our majority owned consolidated subsidiaries. Comparison of 2015 with 2014 Revenues Total revenues for 2015 decreased $20.92 billion when compared to total revenues for 2014. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil and natural gas decreased $11.52 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $10.43 billion decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $1.09 billion decrease. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs and refined products decreased a net $8.13 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for an $8.81 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $680.8 million increase. Revenues from the marketing of petrochemicals, octane additives and high purity isobutylene (“HPIB”) decreased $1.49 billion year-to-year attributable to lower sales prices. Revenues from midstream services increased a net $249.8 million year-to-year primarily due to the ongoing expansion of our operations. Revenues increased $163.4 million year-to-year due to the timing of our acquisition of Oiltanking. Revenues for 2015 also include $117.8 million from assets we acquired in connection with the EFS Midstream acquisition. Revenues decreased $72.6 million year-to-year primarily due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015. The remaining $41.2 million year-to-year increase in revenues is primarily due to the timing of completion of various capital projects, including portions of Aegis and expanded crude oil storage capacity at our ECHO terminal. Operating costs and expenses Total operating costs and expenses for 2015 decreased $20.55 billion when compared to total operating costs and expenses for 2014. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil and natural gas decreased $11.05 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $10.02 billion decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $1.03 billion decrease. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs and refined products decreased a net $8.13 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for an $8.78 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $651.3 million increase. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of petrochemicals, octane additives and HPIB decreased $1.64 billion year-to-year attributable to lower purchase prices. Other operating costs and expenses decreased a net $92.4 million year-to-year due in part to (i) lower fuel costs, which accounted for a $73.9 million decrease, (ii) a producer settlement involving our San Juan Gathering System in 2014, which accounted for an $18.0 million decrease and (iii) the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015, which primarily accounted for an additional $25.2 million year-to-year decrease. These decreases were partially offset by the addition of $49.3 million in operating costs attributable to the timing of the Oiltanking acquisition and assets we acquired in the EFS Midstream acquisition. 78 Table of Contents Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses in operating costs and expenses for 2015 increased $145.5 million when compared to 2014 primarily due to the Oiltanking and EFS Midstream acquisitions, which collectively accounted for $115.7 million of the year-to-year increase. Accretion expense for 2015 includes $39.5 million recognized for certain asset retirement obligations of our former Offshore Business. For information regarding our asset retirement obligations, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. We recorded net losses within operating costs and expenses of $15.6 million attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries in 2015 compared to net gains of $102.1 million in 2014. In 2015, we recognized a $12.3 million loss attributable to our sale of the Offshore Business. In 2014, we recognized $95.0 million of gains attributable to the receipt of nonrefundable cash insurance proceeds. These proceeds were attributable to property damage claims we filed in connection with the February 2011 NGL release and fire at the West Storage location of our Mont Belvieu, Texas underground storage facility. Operating costs and expenses also include $162.6 million and $34.0 million of non-cash asset impairment charges for 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2015, we recorded a $54.8 million non-cash asset impairment charge in connection with the sale of our Offshore Business. The remainder of our non-cash asset impairment charges for 2015 primarily relate to natural gas processing assets in southern Louisiana, certain marine vessels and the abandonment of certain crude oil and natural gas pipeline assets in Texas. General and administrative costs General and administrative costs for 2015 decreased $21.9 million when compared to 2014 primarily due to lower employee compensation costs, which accounted for a $14.8 million decrease. In addition, general and administrative costs for 2014 included $3.8 million of transaction costs associated with Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition and $4.7 million of expense for the settlement of litigation associated with our merger in 2010 with Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2015 increased $114.1 million when compared to 2014 primarily due to increased earnings from our investments in crude oil and NGL pipeline joint ventures. Operating income Operating income for 2015 decreased $235.5 million when compared to 2014 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Interest expense Interest expense for 2015 increased $40.8 million when compared to 2014. The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 1,063.4 $ 969.1 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization 15.4 9.4 Interest cost capitalized in connection with construction projects (149.1 ) (77.9 ) Other 32.1 20.4 Total $ 961.8 $ 921.0 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is the primary driver of interest expense, increased a net $94.3 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2015, which accounted for a $157.6 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates in 2015, which accounted for a $63.3 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2015 was $22.24 billion compared to $18.96 billion during 2014. In general, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital spending program. 79 Table of Contents Change in fair market value of Liquidity Option Agreement Results for 2015 include $25.4 million of non-cash expense we recorded to recognize changes in the fair market value of the Liquidity Option Agreement. Income taxes We recognized an overall income tax benefit of $2.5 million for 2015 compared to a provision for income taxes of $23.1 million for 2014. In June 2015, the State of Texas enacted certain changes to the Texas Margin Tax, which lowered our tax rate. Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $8.9 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to the inclusion of noncontrolling interests in Oiltanking from October 1, 2014 to February 13, 2015, which is the date we completed the Oiltanking acquisition. Business Segment Highlights We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The following table presents gross operating margin by segment and non-GAAP total gross operating margin for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Gross operating margin by segment: NGL Pipelines & Services $ 2,990.6 $ 2,771.6 $ 2,877.7 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services 854.6 961.9 762.5 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 734.9 782.6 803.3 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services 650.6 718.5 681.0 Offshore Pipelines & Services -- 97.5 162.0 Total segment gross operating margin (1) 5,230.7 5,332.1 5,286.5 Net adjustment for shipper make-up rights 17.1 7.1 (81.7 ) Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 5,247.8 $ 5,339.2 $ 5,204.8 (1) Within the context of this table, total segment gross operating margin represents a subtotal and corresponds to measures similarly titled within our business segment disclosures found under Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Total gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Total gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. Gross operating margin by segment for NGL Pipelines & Services and Crude Oil Pipelines & Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights that are included in management’s evaluation of segment results. However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total gross operating margin. 80 Table of Contents The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income. For a discussion of operating income and its components, see the previous section titled “Consolidated Income Statement Highlights” within this Item 7. The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income to total gross operating margin for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Operating income (GAAP) $ 3,580.7 $ 3,540.2 $ 3,775.7 Adjustments to reconcile operating income to total gross operating margin: Add depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 1,456.7 1,428.2 1,282.7 Add asset impairment and related charges in operating costs and expenses 52.8 162.6 34.0 Add net losses and subtract net gains attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries (2.5 ) 15.6 (102.1 ) Add general and administrative costs 160.1 192.6 214.5 Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 5,247.8 $ 5,339.2 $ 5,204.8 Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. The following information highlights significant changes in our year-to-year segment results (i.e., our gross operating margin by segment amounts) and the primary drivers of such changes. The volume statistics presented in the tabular information for each segment are reported on a net basis, taking into account our ownership interests in certain joint ventures, and reflect the periods in which we owned an interest in such operations. These statistics reflect volumes for newly constructed assets from the dates such assets were placed into service. NGL Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Segment gross operating margin: Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities $ 846.6 $ 895.0 $ 1,162.0 NGL pipelines, storage and terminals 1,625.4 1,380.9 1,145.7 NGL fractionation 518.6 495.7 570.0 Total $ 2,990.6 $ 2,771.6 $ 2,877.7 Selected volumetric data: NGL pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 2,965 2,700 2,634 NGL marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 436 302 258 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 828 826 824 Equity NGL production (MBPD) (1) 141 133 116 Fee-based natural gas processing (MMcf/d) (2) 4,736 4,905 4,786 (1) Represents the NGL volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities. (2) Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our gas plants. 81 Table of Contents Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2016 decreased $48.4 million when compared to 2015. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants decreased $123.0 million year-to-year. Collectively, gross operating margin from our Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco plants decreased $53.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower processing margins, including the impact of our related hedging activities. Gross operating margin from our South Texas plants decreased $49.8 million year-to-year attributable to lower average processing fees and margins, which accounted for a combined $38.1 million decrease, and lower fee-based processing volumes of 227 MMcf/d, which accounted for a $15.8 million decrease. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants in Louisiana and Mississippi decreased a combined $21.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower processing margins, which accounted for a $6.4 million decrease (including the impact of related hedging activities), and higher operating expenses. Operating expenses at these plants increased $12.1 million year-to-year, which includes $10.4 million of costs attributable to a fire that occurred at our Pascagoula facility in June 2016. The Pascagoula facility was repaired and placed back into commercial service in December 2016. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased a net $74.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $261.3 million increase, partially offset by a $186.7 million decrease due to lower sales margins. Results from NGL marketing’s export-oriented strategies increased $119.2 million year-to-year, which was partially offset by a $44.6 million net decrease in gross operating margin from NGL marketing’s activities in support of our transportation, storage and plant assets. Comparison of 2015 with 2014. Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2015 decreased $267.0 million when compared to 2014. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants decreased $243.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower processing margins. In addition, gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities for 2015 decreased a net $24.0 million when compared to 2014 primarily due to lower sales margins, which accounted for a $167.4 million decrease, partially offset by a $152.0 million increase due to higher sales volumes. Results from NGL marketing’s activities in support of our transportation, storage and plant assets decreased $37.6 million year-to-year, which was partially offset by a $13.6 million increase in gross operating margin from NGL marketing’s export-oriented strategies. NGL pipelines, storage and terminals Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines, storage and terminal assets for 2016 increased $244.5 million when compared to 2015. On a combined basis, gross operating margin from ATEX and Aegis increased $117.9 million year-to-year primarily due to a 123 MBPD increase in transportation volumes. Contracted volume commitments continue to ramp higher through 2018 for ATEX and 2019 for Aegis. The third and final segment of Aegis was completed in December 2015. Gross operating margin from EHT and a related pipeline increased $99.5 million year-to-year, primarily due to higher marine terminal and pipeline transportation volumes of 122 MBPD and 113 MBPD, respectively. Gross operating margin from our NGL and related product storage complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas increased $26.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher fees. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related terminals increased $10.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower operating expenses. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System increased $9.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation fees, which escalated in January 2016. Gross operating margin from our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, which was placed into commercial service in September 2016, was a loss of $16.2 million primarily due to commissioning costs. The new terminal is expected to become profitable in 2017 as contractual customer volume commitments increase. 82 Table of Contents Comparison of 2015 with 2014. Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines, storage and terminal assets for 2015 increased $235.2 million when compared to 2014. Gross operating margin from the Chaparral Pipeline, Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related terminals increased $63.2 million in 2015 when compared to 2014. Higher transportation tariffs and other fees, which accounted for a $66.2 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin, and a $41.1 million year-to-year decrease in operating expenses were partially offset by a $44.1 million decrease in gross operating margin attributable to lower transportation volumes. Transportation volumes on these three pipelines for 2015 decreased a combined 76 MBPD due in part to lower recoveries of ethane when compared to 2014. Lower recoveries of ethane at upstream natural gas processing plants served by these pipelines resulted in lower volumes of ethane available for transportation. Gross operating margin from our investments in the Front Range Pipeline, Texas Express Pipeline and Texas Express Gathering System for 2015 increased $17.8 million primarily due to a combined 28 MBPD increase in transportation volumes (net to our interest) when compared to 2014. Gross operating margin from ATEX and Aegis increased $18.6 million year-to-year primarily due to a combined 37 MBPD increase in transportation volumes. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System increased $26.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes of 39 MBPD. Lastly, gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage assets increased $14.1 million year-to-year as a result of net operational measurement losses during 2014 that did not reoccur in 2015. Gross operating margin from EHT and a related pipeline increased $78.6 million year-to-year primarily due to (i) increased fee revenues of $41.9 million earned in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the timing of our acquisition of Oiltanking and (ii) $36.7 million due to higher year-to-year marine terminal and pipeline transportation volumes of 47 MBPD and 60 MBPD, respectively. EHT continues to earn margin sharing and other fees from our NGL marketing group as it did prior to the Oiltanking acquisition in October 2014. Prior to our acquisition of the terminal, these fees were paid to Oiltanking. Following the acquisition, these fees are charged to our NGL marketing group using intercompany agreements and are reflected in gross operating margin; however, the intercompany amounts are eliminated in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to the $41.9 million year-to-year increase, gross operating margin from this terminal for 2015 reflects a full year of these intercompany fees compared to one quarter in 2014. NGL fractionation Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2016 increased $22.9 million when compared to 2015 primarily due to higher fractionation revenues at our Mont Belvieu fractionators. Fractionation revenues at Mont Belvieu increased $25.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher fees, which accounted for a $13.2 million increase, and higher fractionation volumes of 10 MBPD, which accounted for an additional $12.4 million increase. Comparison of 2015 with 2014. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2015 decreased $74.3 million when compared to 2014. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators decreased $62.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower product blending and other fee revenues as a result of lower commodity prices in 2015. Gross operating margin from our Norco NGL fractionator in Louisiana decreased a net $6.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower revenues from product blending and percent-of-liquids contracts attributable to lower energy commodity prices, which accounted for a $13.4 million year-to-year decrease, partially offset by an $8.9 million increase due to higher fractionation volumes of 13 MBPD. Gross operating margin from our Hobbs NGL fractionator in Gaines County, Texas decreased $5.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower fractionation volumes of 8 MBPD. 83 Table of Contents Crude Oil Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Segment gross operating margin $ 854.6 $ 961.9 $ 762.5 Selected volumetric data: Crude oil pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 1,388 1,474 1,278 Crude oil marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 495 557 691 Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from our Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for 2016 decreased $107.3 million when compared to 2015. Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related trucking activities decreased $187.5 million year-to-year primarily due to lower crude oil sales margins, which accounted for a $147.1 million decrease, and $40.4 million of net non-cash mark-to-market losses recognized in 2016 on financial instruments related to blending activities. As a result of lower crude oil prices, regional price spreads have been less than the transportation costs incurred by our marketing business, particularly on its 75 MBPD of firm capacity on the Seaway Pipeline (25 MBPD of this capacity terminates in June 2017). Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System decreased $95.0 million year-to-year primarily due to a 74 MBPD decrease in volumes, which accounted for a $66.6 million decrease, and a $32.4 million decrease due to lower average transportation fees. The decrease in crude oil transportation volumes is attributable to reduced producer drilling activity in the Eagle Ford Shale. Gross operating margin from our EFS Midstream system, which we acquired effective July 1, 2015, increased $127.9 million year-to-year due to the timing of the acquisition of these assets. Gross operating margin for this system reflects twelve months of ownership in 2016 versus six months in 2015. Gross operating margin from crude oil terminaling services at our Beaumont Marine West and ECHO facilities increased a combined $33.9 million year-to-year primarily due to expansion projects. Gross operating margin from our investment in Seaway for 2016 increased $14.2 million when compared to 2015 primarily due to the settlement of a rate case with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) in the first quarter of 2016. In February 2016, the FERC issued its decision regarding the various challenges to Seaway’s committed and uncommitted rates in FERC Docket No. IS12-226-000. The FERC upheld the committed rates and rejected the claim that the committed rates should be reduced to cost-based levels. The FERC’s rulings regarding the uncommitted rates were also largely favorable to Seaway. Seaway submitted a compliance filing in March 2016 calculating revised uncommitted rates consistent with the FERC’s order. The compliance filing was not challenged and the FERC accepted the revised rates. On a 100% basis, Seaway recorded a $24.5 million benefit related to settlement of the rate case, with our 50% share of the benefit equating to $12.3 million. Comparison of 2015 with 2014. Gross operating margin from our Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for 2015 increased $199.4 million when compared to 2014. Gross operating margin from providing crude oil terminaling services at EHT increased $99.7 million year-to-year primarily due to the timing of the Oiltanking acquisition (i.e., gross operating margin from these services for 2015 reflects a full year of operations versus one quarter for 2014). The EFS Midstream system contributed $91.1 million of gross operating margin to our 2015 results along with 65 MBPD of throughput volumes. In addition, gross operating margin from our ECHO terminal in Houston, Texas increased $11.8 million year-to-year due to our completion of an expansion project at this facility during 2015. 84 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our equity investment in the Seaway Pipeline increased $76.1 million year-to-year primarily due to contributions from the Seaway Loop, which began commercial operations in December 2014. Seaway’s transportation volumes increased a net 97 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest) primarily due to an increase in long-haul volumes. Gross operating margin from our equity investment in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System increased $18.5 million year-to-year primarily due to a 50 MBPD increase in pipeline transportation volumes (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our West Texas System increased $11.6 million year-to-year primarily due to a 22 MBPD increase in pipeline transportation volumes during 2015. Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System decreased $56.5 million year-to-year primarily due to a $45.7 million decrease from the sale of excess crude oil volumes obtained through pipeline tariff allowances and a 15 MBPD decrease in volumes, which accounted for an additional $14.0 million decrease. The decrease in gross operating margin from the sale of excess crude oil volumes by the pipeline was primarily due to lower crude oil prices year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related trucking activities decreased $53.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower crude oil sales margins. Natural Gas Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Segment gross operating margin $ 734.9 $ 782.6 $ 803.3 Selected volumetric data: Natural gas pipeline transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 11,874 12,321 12,476 Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for 2016 decreased $47.7 million when compared to 2015. Gross operating margin from our Acadian Gas System decreased $18.8 million year-to-year primarily due to reduced transportation fees. Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System decreased $16.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower revenues attributable to decreased producer drilling activity in the Eagle Ford Shale and Barnett Shale. Transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System decreased 149 BBtus/d year-to-year. Collectively, gross operating margin for 2016 from our San Juan, Jonah, Piceance Basin and Fairplay Gathering Systems decreased $18.4 million when compared to 2015, the primarily driver of which is a combined 363 BBtus/d decrease in gathering volumes. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities decreased a net $2.8 million year-to-year primarily due to mark-to-market losses recorded in 2016 on financial instruments related to commodity hedging. Gross operating margin from our Carlsbad Gathering System in West Texas and New Mexico increased $13.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher gathering volumes of 97 BBtus/d. Comparison of 2015 with 2014. Gross operating margin from our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for 2015 decreased $20.7 million when compared to 2014. Gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System decreased a net $19.2 million year-to-year primarily due to (i) a $19.7 million decrease in gathering fees, which are indexed to natural gas prices, (ii) a $12.2 million decrease in condensate sales primarily due to lower sales prices and (iii) a $3.1 million decrease due to lower gathering volumes. These decreases were partially offset by an $18.0 million charge recorded in 2014 related to the settlement of a contract dispute with a producer. Gross operating margin from our Piceance Basin and Haynesville Gathering Systems decreased $17.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower gathering volumes, which accounted for a $12.0 million decrease, and lower gathering fees, which accounted for an additional $5.9 million decrease. Producers served by these three gathering systems curtailed their drilling programs during 2015 in response to the low price of natural gas. Collectively, natural gas transportation volumes for these three gathering systems decreased 266 BBtus/d year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System decreased $13.6 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in maintenance and other operating expenses. 85 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our Jonah Gathering System increased a net $20.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher gathering fees, which accounted for an $11.6 million increase and higher transportation volumes of 84 BBtus/d, which accounted for an additional $8.4 million increase. Gross operating margin from our Carlsbad Gathering System increased $6.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher gathering and other fees, which accounted for a $4.1 million increase, and higher volumes of 47 BBtus/d, which accounted for a $3.5 million increase, partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in maintenance and other expenses. Lastly, gross operating margin from our Acadian Gas System increased $5.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower operating expenses. Petrochemical & Refined Products Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Petrochemical & Refined Products Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Segment gross operating margin: Propylene fractionation and related activities $ 212.1 $ 189.5 $ 227.4 Butane isomerization and related operations 52.0 65.2 75.3 Octane enhancement and related plant operations 42.2 144.3 122.4 Refined products pipelines and related activities 305.6 258.8 186.7 Marine transportation and other 38.7 60.7 69.2 Total $ 650.6 $ 718.5 $ 681.0 Selected volumetric data: Propylene fractionation volumes (MBPD) 73 71 75 Butane isomerization volumes (MBPD) 108 96 93 Standalone DIB processing volumes (MBPD) 89 79 82 Octane additive and related plant production volumes (MBPD) 22 17 17 Pipeline transportation volumes, primarily refined products & petrochemicals (MBPD) 837 784 758 Refined products and petrochemical marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 389 355 270 Propylene fractionation and related activities Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from propylene fractionation and related activities for 2016 increased $22.6 million when compared to 2015. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu propylene fractionation plants increased a net $37.1 million year-to-year. When compared to results for 2015, these plants benefitted in 2016 from $29.6 million of lower operating costs, $16.6 million of higher propylene fractionation and other fee revenues, and a $13.1 million increase in gross operating margin attributable to higher propylene fractionation volumes of 3 MBPD. The year-to-year decrease in operating costs is attributable to major maintenance projects that were completed in 2015. Partially offsetting these benefits was a $22.2 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin attributable to lower propylene sales margins. Pre-commissioning expenses associated with our PDH facility increased $15.5 million during 2016 when compared to 2015. We expect our PDH facility to commence commercial operations mid-2017. Comparison of 2015 with 2014. Gross operating margin from propylene fractionation and related activities decreased $37.9 million for 2015 when compared to 2014. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu propylene fractionation plants decreased $46.4 million year-to-year. This decrease was primarily due to (i) a $28.3 million increase in operating expenses primarily for major maintenance activities we completed during 2015, (ii) lower propylene sales volumes, which accounted for a $5.0 million decrease, (iii) lower propylene sales margins, which accounted for an additional $3.9 million decrease, and (iv) a $9.2 million decrease primarily due to lower propylene fractionation and other fees. Gross operating margin from our propylene rail terminal at Mont Belvieu increased $4.4 million for 2015 primarily due to higher fees. Gross operating margin from the remainder of our propylene fractionation business increased $4.1 million for 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to operational measurement losses in 2014 that did not reoccur in 2015. 86 Table of Contents Isomerization and related operations Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization and deisobutanizer (“DIB”) operations for 2016 decreased a net $13.2 million when compared to 2015. Operating expenses associated with our isomerization facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas increased $22.4 million year-to-year primarily due to major maintenance activities we completed during 2016. Butane processing revenues increased $7.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher butane isomerization and standalone DIB processing volumes of 12 MBPD and 10 MBPD, respectively. Comparison of 2015 with 2014. Gross operating margin from our butane isomerization and DIB operations for 2015 decreased $10.1 million when compared to 2014. By-product sales revenues decreased $30.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices and isomerization revenues decreased $8.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower fees. The decrease in revenues was partially offset by lower maintenance and other operating expenses, which declined $29.4 million year-to-year. Octane enhancement and related operations Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement facility and HPIB plant for 2016 decreased $102.1 million when compared to 2015. This year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is primarily due to lower sales margins, including the results of our related hedging activities. Comparison of 2015 with 2014. Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement facility and HPIB plant for 2015 increased $21.9 million when compared to 2014. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to higher sales volumes during 2015 when compared to 2014. Refined products pipelines and related activities Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2016 increased $46.8 million when compared to 2015. Gross operating margin from our refined products terminals in Beaumont, Texas increased $24.9 million year-to-year primarily due to expansions and higher demand for storage and marine vessel loading services. Gross operating margin for the TE Products Pipeline and related terminals increased $20.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher volumes. Interstate refined products pipeline transportation volumes on our TE Products Pipeline increased 10 MBPD year-to-year. Intrastate refined products and petrochemical pipeline transportation volumes on our TE Products Pipeline increased a combined 40 MBPD year-to-year. Comparison of 2015 with 2014. Gross operating margin from our refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2015 increased $72.1 million when compared to 2014. Gross operating margin from providing refined products and petrochemical terminaling services at Beaumont and EHT increased $60.7 million year-to-year primarily due to the timing of the Oiltanking acquisition, which accounted for $45.1 million of the increase (i.e., gross operating margin from the acquired assets for 2015 reflects a full year of operations versus one quarter for 2014). Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline and related refined products terminals increased $7.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher tariffs and other fees. Overall, transportation volumes on the TE Products Pipeline increased a net 30 MBPD year-to-year primarily due to higher refined products and petrochemical transportation volumes. Other Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other activities for 2016 decreased $22.0 million when compared to 2015 primarily due to lower demand for marine transportation services attributable to the lower commodity pricing environment. 87 Table of Contents Offshore Pipelines & Services We sold our Offshore Business to Genesis on July 24, 2015. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Offshore Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted). For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Segment gross operating margin $ 97.5 $ 162.0 Selected volumetric data: Natural gas transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 587 627 Crude oil transportation volumes (MBPD) 357 330 Platform natural gas processing (MMcf/d) 101 145 Platform crude oil processing (MBPD) 13 14 Amounts presented for 2015 reflect results through the closing date of the sale, July 24, 2015. Liquidity and Capital Resources Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. At December 31, 2016, we had $3.78 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $3.72 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $63.1 million of unrestricted cash on hand. We expect to issue additional equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital spending. At December 31, 2016, the aggregate carrying value of our product inventories was $1.77 billion compared to $1.04 billion at December 31, 2015. Our inventories, and associated working capital commitments, have increased significantly since December 31, 2015 primarily due to our marketing groups utilization of contango opportunities using our storage assets. We expect to gradually settle these inventory positions (valued at approximately $1.1 billion) through the first quarter of 2017, with a corresponding decrease in working capital commitments and related debt. For additional information regarding our inventories, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Consolidated Debt The following table presents scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2016 for the years indicated (dollars in millions): Scheduled Maturities of Debt Total 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Commercial Paper Notes $ 1,777.2 $ 1,777.2 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- Senior Notes 20,650.0 800.0 1,100.0 1,500.0 1,500.0 575.0 15,175.0 Junior Subordinated Notes 1,474.4 -- -- -- -- -- 1,474.4 Total $ 23,901.6 $ 2,577.2 $ 1,100.0 $ 1,500.0 $ 1,500.0 $ 575.0 $ 16,649.4 The following information describes significant transactions that affected our consolidated debt obligations during the year ended December 31, 2016: Issuance of $1.25 Billion of Senior Notes in April 2016 In April 2016, EPO issued $575 million in principal amount of 2.85% senior notes due April 2021 (“Senior Notes RR”), $575 million in principal amount of 3.95% senior notes due February 2027 (“Senior Notes SS”) and $100 million in principal amount of 4.90% reopened senior notes due May 2046 (“Senior Notes QQ”). Senior Notes RR, SS and QQ were issued at 99.898%, 99.760% and 95.516% of their principal amounts, respectively. EPO issued these senior notes using the 2013 Shelf (see “Universal shelf registration statement” below). 88 Table of Contents Net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes were used as follows: (i) the repayment of amounts then outstanding under EPO’s commercial paper program, which included amounts we used to repay $750 million in principal amount of Senior Notes AA that matured in February 2016, and (ii) for general company purposes. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has unconditionally guaranteed these senior notes on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis. These senior notes rank equal with EPO’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and are senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of EPO. These senior notes are subject to make-whole redemption rights and were issued under an indenture containing certain covenants, which generally restrict EPO’s ability (with certain exceptions) to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. Renewal of 364-Day Credit Agreement In September 2016, EPO amended its 364-Day Credit Agreement to extend its maturity date to September 2017. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement. Under the terms of the 364-Day Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $1.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $200 million to $1.7 billion at EPO’s election, provided certain conditions are met) at a variable interest rate for a term of 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. To the extent that principal amounts are outstanding at the maturity date, EPO may elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as a non-revolving term loan for a period of one additional year, payable in September 2018. EPO’s obligations under the 364-Day Credit Agreement are not secured by any collateral; however, they are guaranteed by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Issuance of Common Units The following table summarizes the issuance of common units in connection with our at-the-market (“ATM”) program, distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) and employee unit purchase plan (“EUPP”) for the periods indicated (dollars in millions, number of units issued as shown): Number of Common Units Issued Net Cash Proceeds Received Year Ended December 31, 2014: Common units issued in connection with ATM program 1,590,334 $ 57.7 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 9,754,227 331.1 Total 11,344,561 $ 388.8 Year Ended December 31, 2015: Common units issued in connection with ATM program 25,520,424 $ 817.4 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 12,793,913 371.2 Total 38,314,337 $ 1,188.6 Year Ended December 31, 2016: Common units issued in connection with ATM program 87,867,037 $ 2,156.1 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 16,316,534 386.7 Total 104,183,571 $ 2,542.8 In January 2016, we sold an aggregate 3,830,256 common units under the ATM program to privately held affiliates of EPCO, which generated gross proceeds of $100 million. In February 2016, privately held affiliates of EPCO reinvested an additional $100 million, resulting in the issuance of 4,481,504 common units under our DRIP. Universal shelf registration statement In May 2016, we filed with the SEC a new universal shelf registration statement (the “2016 Shelf”), which was immediately effective and replaced our prior universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in June 2013 (the “2013 Shelf”). The 2016 Shelf allows (and the prior 2013 Shelf allowed) Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and EPO (each on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. 89 Table of Contents ATM Program In July 2016, we filed an amended registration statement with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $1.89 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings. Pursuant to the ATM program, we may sell common units under an equity distribution agreement between Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and certain broker-dealers from time-to-time by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement. The new registration statement was declared effective on July 14, 2016 and replaced our prior registration statement with respect to the ATM program. Following the effectiveness of the new ATM registration statement and after taking into account the aggregate sales price of common units sold under the ATM program through December 31, 2016, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under the ATM program up to an aggregate sales price of $1.44 billion. DRIP and EUPP In May 2016, we filed with the SEC a new registration statement in connection with our DRIP, which was immediately effective and amended a prior registration statement filed in March 2010. The new registration statement increased the aggregate number of our common units authorized for issuance under the DRIP from 140,000,000 to 240,000,000. The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional new common units. After taking into account the new registration statement and the number of common units issued under the DRIP through December 31, 2016, we have the capacity to issue an additional 99,258,495 common units under this plan. In addition to the DRIP, we have registration statements on file with the SEC authorizing the issuance of up to 8,000,000 of our common units in connection with our EUPP. After taking into account the number of common units issued under the EUPP through December 31, 2016, we had the capacity to issue an additional 6,265,475 common units under this plan. Use of Proceeds The net cash proceeds we received from the issuance of common units during 2016 were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under EPO’s commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities and for general company purposes. For additional information regarding our issuance of common units and related registration statements, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Restricted Cash Restricted cash represents amounts held in segregated bank accounts by our clearing brokers as margin in support of our commodity derivative instruments portfolio and related physical purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and refined products. Additional cash may be restricted to maintain our commodity derivative instruments portfolio as prices fluctuate or margin requirements change. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our restricted cash amounts were $354.5 million and $15.9 million, respectively. The balance at December 31, 2016 consisted of initial margin requirements of $35.6 million and variation margin requirements of $318.9 million. The initial margin requirements will be returned to us as the related derivative instruments are settled. Our variation margin requirements increased by $339.3 million since December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher forward commodity prices for NGLs and related hydrocarbons during 2016 relative to our short financial derivative positions in these products. For information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 90 Table of Contents Credit Ratings As of February 24, 2017, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s and Baa1 from Moody’s. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO’s short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor’s and P-2 from Moody’s. Fitch Ratings issued non-solicited ratings of BBB+ and F-2 for EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt securities and short-term senior unsecured debt securities, respectively. EPO’s credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 4,066.8 $ 4,002.4 $ 4,162.2 Cash used in investing activities 4,344.4 3,441.8 5,797.9 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 321.7 (616.0 ) 1,653.2 Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. We operate in the midstream energy industry, which includes gathering, transporting, processing, fractionating and storing natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemical and refined products. As such, changes in the prices of hydrocarbon products and in the relative price levels among hydrocarbon products could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in prices may impact demand for hydrocarbon products, which in turn may impact production, demand and the volumes of products for which we provide services. In addition, decreases in demand may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels. We may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their obligations to us in connection with our marketing of natural gas, NGLs, propylene, refined products and/or crude oil and long-term take-or-pay agreements. Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a major consideration in our businesses, and our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to sufficiently eliminate customer credit risk. Further, adverse economic conditions in our industry, such as those experienced throughout 2015 and 2016, increase the risk of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers, particularly customers that have sub-investment grade credit ratings or small-scale companies. Such non-performance risk could be associated with long-term contracts with minimum volume commitments or fixed demand charges. We manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions may utilize letters of credit, prepayments, net out agreements and guarantees. However, these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk. Our primary market areas are located in the Gulf Coast, Southwest, Rocky Mountain, Northeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. We have a concentration of trade receivable balances due from major integrated oil companies, independent oil companies and other pipelines and wholesalers. These concentrations of market areas may affect our overall credit risk in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. 91 Table of Contents The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts: Comparison of 2016 with 2015 Operating Activities Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $64.4 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $142.4 million year-to-year increase in cash primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations partially offset by an $81.6 million year-to-year decrease in cash distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015. For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see “Results of Operations” within this Part II, Item 7. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $902.6 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to: § a $1.56 billion year-to-year decrease in cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries primarily due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015, which generated proceeds of $1.53 billion; and § a $322.7 million year-to-year increase in cash outflows to satisfy restricted cash requirements; partially offset by § an $827.5 million year-to-year decrease in capital spending for consolidated property, plant and equipment (see “Capital Spending” within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information regarding our capital spending program); § an $80.3 million year-to-year decrease in aggregate cash used for business combinations and investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates; and § $71.0 million of distributions received in connection with the return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates during 2016. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $321.7 million compared to cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $616.0 million. The $937.7 million year-to-year change in cash flow from financing activities was primarily due to: § a $1.35 billion year-to-year increase in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units. We issued an aggregate 104,183,571 common units in connection with our ATM program, DRIP and EUPP during 2016, which generated $2.54 billion of net cash proceeds. This compares to an aggregate 38,314,337 common units we issued in connection with these programs and plans during 2015, which collectively generated $1.19 billion of net cash proceeds; partially offset by § a $356.8 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners during 2016 when compared to 2015. The increase in cash distributions is due to increases in both the number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the quarterly cash distribution rates per unit; and § a $72.6 million year-to-year decrease in net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements. EPO issued $1.25 billion and repaid $750.0 billion in principal amount of senior notes during 2016, compared to the issuance of $2.5 billion and repayment of $1.48 billion in principal amount of senior and junior notes during 2015. Net proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program were $647.9 million during 2016 compared to $202.2 million during 2015. 92 Table of Contents Comparison of 2015 with 2014 Operating Activities Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $159.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: § a $215.1 million year-to-year decrease in cash primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations; and § a $31.7 million decrease in cash attributable to lower partnership income in 2015 compared to 2014 (after adjusting our $275.1 million year-to-year decrease in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); partially offset by § an $87.0 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates generally attributable to our investments in crude oil and NGL pipeline joint ventures. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $2.36 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to: § a $1.46 billion year-to-year increase in cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries primarily due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015, which generated proceeds of $1.53 billion; § a $1.1 billion cash payment in July 2015 (the initial installment) for the acquisition of EFS Midstream compared to an aggregate $2.42 billion cash payment made in October 2014 in connection with Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition; and § a $559.8 million year-to-year decrease in cash contributions to our unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to the completion of construction of the Front Range Pipeline and the Seaway Loop in 2014, partially offset by increased investments in the Eagle Ford Terminals Corpus Christi and Delaware Gas Basin Processing Plant in 2015; partially offset by § a $947.6 million year-to-year increase in capital spending for consolidated property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs; and § an $81.5 million year-to-year increase in cash outflows to satisfy restricted cash requirements. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $616.0 million compared to cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $1.65 billion. The $2.27 billion year-to-year change in cash flow from financing activities was primarily due to: § a $2.81 billion year-to-year decrease in net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements. EPO issued $2.5 billion in senior notes and repaid $1.48 billion in principal amount of debt obligations in 2015 compared to the issuance of $4.75 billion and repayment of $1.15 billion in principal amount of senior notes in 2014. In addition, net proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program were $202.2 million during 2015 compared to $430.6 million during 2014; and § a $305.6 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners in 2015 when compared to 2014. The increase in cash distributions is due to increases in both the number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the quarterly cash distribution rates per unit; partially offset by § a $799.8 million year-to-year increase in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units. 93 Table of Contents Cash Distributions to Limited Partners Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business including, for example, those for capital expenditures, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, commitments and contingencies and other significant amounts. The retention of cash by the partnership allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets. We measure available cash by reference to “distributable cash flow,” which is a non-GAAP liquidity measure. Distributable cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly cash distributions. Distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Our management compares the distributable cash flow we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. Based on the level of available cash, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board of Enterprise GP, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Unlike several other master limited partnerships, our general partner has a non-economic ownership interest in us and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from us based on IDRs or other equity interests. Our use of distributable cash flow for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. For a discussion of net cash flows provided by operating activities, see the previous section titled “Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities” within this Item 7. 94 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our calculation of distributable cash flow for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Net income attributable to limited partners (1) $ 2,513.1 $ 2,521.2 $ 2,787.4 Adjustments to GAAP net income attributable to limited partners to derive non-GAAP distributable cash flow: Add depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 1,552.0 1,516.0 1,360.5 Add non-cash asset impairment and related charges 53.5 162.6 34.0 Add losses or subtract gains attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries (2.5 ) 15.6 (102.1 ) Add cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries (2) 46.5 1,608.6 145.3 Add changes in fair value of Liquidity Option Agreement (3) 24.5 25.4 -- Add or subtract changes in fair market value of derivative instruments 45.0 (18.4 ) 30.6 Add cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates (4) 451.5 462.1 375.1 Subtract equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates (362.0 ) (373.6 ) (259.5 ) Subtract sustaining capital expenditures (5) (252.0 ) (272.6 ) (369.0 ) Add gains from monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges (6) 6.1 -- 27.6 Add deferred income tax expense or subtract benefit, as applicable 6.6 (20.6 ) 6.1 Other, net 20.5 (19.0 ) 42.6 Distributable cash flow $ 4,102.8 $ 5,607.3 $ 4,078.6 Total cash distributions paid to limited partners with respect to period $ 3,394.0 $ 3,036.8 $ 2,707.6 Cash distributions per unit declared by Enterprise GP with respect to period (7) $ 1.6100 $ 1.5300 $ 1.4500 Total distributable cash flow retained by partnership with respect to period (8) $ 708.8 $ 2,570.5 $ 1,371.0 Distribution coverage ratio (9) 1.21x 1.85x 1.51x (1) For a discussion of significant changes in our comparative income statement amounts underlying net income attributable to limited partners, along with the primary drivers of such changes, see “Consolidated Income Statements Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7.

(8) At the sole discretion of Enterprise GP, cash retained by the partnership with respect to each of these years was primarily reinvested in our growth capital spending program, which reduced our reliance on the equity and debt capital markets to fund such major expenditures. (9) Distribution coverage ratio is determined by dividing distributable cash flow by total cash distributions paid to limited partners and in connection with distribution equivalent rights with respect to the period. 95 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by operating activities to non-GAAP distributable cash flow for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 4,066.8 $ 4,002.4 $ 4,162.2 Adjustments to reconcile net cash flows provided by operating activities to distributable cash flow: Subtract sustaining capital expenditures (252.0 ) (272.6 ) (369.0 ) Add cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries 46.5 1,608.6 145.3 Subtract losses or add gains from monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges 6.1 -- 27.6 Net effect of changes in operating accounts 180.9 323.3 108.2 Other, net 54.5 (54.4 ) 4.3 Distributable cash flow $ 4,102.8 $ 5,607.3 $ 4,078.6 Designated Units Issued in Connection with Holdings Merger In November 2010, we completed our merger with Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. (the “Holdings Merger”). In connection with the Holdings Merger, a privately held affiliate of EPCO agreed to temporarily waive the regular cash distributions it would otherwise receive from us with respect to a certain number of our common units it owns (the “Designated Units”). Distributions paid by us to this privately held affiliate of EPCO during 2015 excluded 35,380,000 Designated Units. The temporary distribution waiver expired in November 2015; therefore, distributions paid to partners during calendar year 2016 were on all outstanding common units. Capital Spending An important part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to expand our network of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production resulting from development activities in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, Northeast and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, including the Niobrara, Barnett, Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville, Marcellus and Utica Shale plays. Although our focus in recent years has been on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, asset acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. In light of current business conditions, we expect that these opportunities will increase. We began commercial service on approximately $2.2 billion of growth capital projects during 2016. These projects included our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, Waha and South Eddy natural gas processing facilities and the completion of over 2 MMBbls of additional crude oil storage capacity at our terminals in Houston and Beaumont. In addition, we have approximately $6.7 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed by 2020 including our PDH and iBDH facilities, the Midland-to-Sealy segment of our Midland-to-ECHO Pipeline System and completion of joint venture-owned dock infrastructure in Corpus Christi designed to accommodate crude oil volumes. We currently expect our total capital spending for the year ended December 31, 2017 to approximate $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion, which includes approximately $250 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our forecast of capital spending for 2017 is based on our announced strategic operating and growth plans (through the filing date of this annual report), which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital spending due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather related issues and changes in supplier prices. Furthermore, our forecast of capital spending may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include unforeseen acquisition opportunities. 96 Table of Contents Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a significant factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we expect to make the forecast capital expenditures noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions. The following table summarizes our capital spending for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 EFS Midstream acquisition $ 1,000.0 $ 1,056.5 $ -- Oiltanking acquisition: Cash consideration -- -- 2,416.8 Equity consideration -- 1,408.7 2,171.5 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net: Growth capital projects (1) 2,722.7 3,540.0 2,502.8 Sustaining capital projects (2) 261.4 271.6 361.2 Investments in unconsolidated affiliates 138.8 162.6 722.4 Other investing activities 0.4 5.3 5.8 Total capital spending $ 4,123.3 $ 6,444.7 $ 8,180.5 (1) Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. (2) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. Fluctuations in our spending for growth capital projects and investments in unconsolidated affiliates are explained in large part by increases or decreases in spending on major expansion projects. Our most significant growth capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016 involved projects at our Mont Belvieu complex. Fluctuations in spending for sustaining capital projects are explained in large part by the timing and cost of pipeline integrity and similar projects. Comparison of 2016 with 2015. We acquired EFS Midstream in July 2015 for approximately $2.1 billion in cash, which was payable in two installments. The initial payment of $1.1 billion was paid at closing in July 2015. The second and final installment of $1.0 billion was paid in July 2016 using a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program. For additional information regarding the EFS Midstream acquisition, including an allocation of the purchase price, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. In total, capital spending for property, plant and equipment decreased $827.5 million year-to-year primarily due to lower growth capital spending during 2016. Growth capital spending for LPG export expansion projects at EHT and our ethane export facility decreased a combined $328.9 million year-to-year. We completed two expansion projects during 2015 at our EHT facility that increased our ability to load cargos of fully refrigerated, low-ethane propane to approximately 16.0 MMBbls per month. In September 2016, we placed our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal into service. Likewise, growth capital spending on our ethane header system between Corpus Christi, Texas and the Mississippi River in Louisiana decreased $288.1 million year-to-year. We completed the Aegis Ethane Pipeline (i.e., the largest component of our ethane header system) in December 2015. Growth capital spending at our ECHO and Beaumont Marine West Crude Oil terminals decreased a combined $146.1 million year-to-year as new storage tanks and related assets were placed into service at these facilities during 2015 and 2016. Growth capital spending for our Rancho II crude oil pipeline, which is a component of our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System, and Midland-to-ECHO Pipeline System decreased a net $95.0 million year-to-year. We completed the Rancho II pipeline in September 2015. The Midland-to-ECHO Pipeline System is expected to be completed and placed into service at initial rates of 300 MBPD in the fourth quarter of 2017 once the Midland-to-Sealy segment is constructed. 97 Table of Contents Growth capital spending at our Mont Belvieu complex increased $67.1 million year-to-year primarily due to ongoing construction of our PDH facility. Currently, we expect construction of the PDH facility to be completed in the first quarter of 2017 with commercial operations expected to begin in the second quarter of 2017. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates decreased $23.8 million year-to-year primarily due to the completion of expansion projects on our Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System during 2015. Comparison of 2015 with 2014. Capital spending for 2015 included the initial payment of approximately $1.1 billion to acquire EFS Midstream. In addition, capital spending during 2015 included $1.4 billion of non-cash equity consideration we issued to complete Step 2 of the Oiltanking acquisition. Step 2 represented our acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in Oiltanking; therefore, approximately $1.4 billion of noncontrolling interests attributable to Oiltanking was reclassified to limited partners’ equity to reflect the February 2015 issuance of 36,827,517 of our common units. Capital spending for 2014 reflected total cash and equity consideration of approximately $4.6 billion to OTA to complete Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition. For information regarding the Oiltanking acquisition, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. In total, capital spending for property, plant and equipment increased $947.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher growth capital spending during 2015. Growth capital spending at our Mont Belvieu complex increased $385.2 million year-to-year primarily due to construction of the PDH facility. Growth capital spending for LPG export expansion projects at EHT and our ethane export facility increased a combined $282.6 million year-to-year. Growth capital spending on our natural gas processing and related pipeline projects in the Delaware Basin increased a combined $235.2 million year-to-year. Our South Eddy natural gas processing plant and related pipeline infrastructure began operations in May 2016. Growth capital spending on our Rancho II crude oil pipeline and the expansion of crude oil terminal assets at our ECHO, EHT and Beaumont Marine West terminals increased a combined $218.2 million year-to-year. Growth capital spending on our Gulf Coast ethane header system increased $208.0 million year-to-year. Growth capital spending attributable to ATEX and the Rocky Mountain expansion of our Mid-America Pipeline System decreased a combined $264.2 million year-to-year. These two projects were completed during the first quarter of 2015. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates decreased $559.8 million year-to-year primarily due to completion of the Seaway Loop pipeline in December 2014. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following sections discuss the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies: Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Our estimate of depreciation expense incorporates management assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected residual values or (iv) significant changes in our forecast of the remaining life for the applicable resource basins, if any. 98 Table of Contents At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $33.29 billion and $32.03 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.22 billion, $1.16 billion and $1.11 billion of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals or refined products. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated residual values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset’s estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes. An equity method investment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible permanent loss in value of the investment (i.e., other than a temporary decline). Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee’s industry. When evidence of a loss in value has occurred, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment’s underlying assets. A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any write-down of the carrying values of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $45.2 million, $162.6 million and $34.0 million, respectively, which are a component of costs and expenses. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Amortization Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. The method used to value such assets depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns the asset is expected to generate. 99 Table of Contents Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to certain relationships acquired in connection with business combinations and asset purchases whereby (i) we acquired information about or access to customers and now have the ability to provide services to them and (ii) the customers now have the ability to make direct contact with us. Customer relationships may arise from contractual arrangements (such as service contracts) and through means other than contracts, such as through regular contact by sales or service representatives. The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization periods for certain of our customer relationship intangible assets are limited by the estimated finite economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basins. In this context, our estimate of the useful life of each resource basin is predicated on a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. Contract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement and the Jonah natural gas transportation contracts. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a fractionation facility, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements. If our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset’s unamortized cost is not recoverable due to impairment, we would be required to reduce the asset’s carrying value to its estimated fair value through the recording of a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was $3.86 billion and $4.04 billion, respectively. We recorded $171.3 million, $174.1 million and $110.6 million of amortization expense attributable to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is subject to annual impairment testing at the end of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is probable that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Goodwill impairment testing involves determining the fair value of the associated reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the businesses that make up the reporting unit. Such assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the associated businesses, which, in turn, rely on management’s estimates of operating margins, throughput volumes and similar inputs; (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond discrete forecast periods; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of a reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a non-cash charge to operating costs and expenses is required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying value of our goodwill was $5.75 billion. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2016, 2015 or 2014. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment test at December 31, 2016, each reporting unit’s fair value was substantially in excess of its carrying value (i.e., by at least 10%). For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 100 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Policies and Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses In general, we recognize revenue from customers when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. We record revenue when sales contracts are settled (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed). We record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts as required by our established policy. For additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Our use of estimates for certain revenues and expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of our use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for a specific period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. If the assumptions underlying our revenue and expense estimates prove to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. We review our estimates based on currently available information. 101 Table of Contents Other Items Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 (dollars in millions): Payment or Settlement due by Period Less than 1-3 4-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1) $ 23,901.6 $ 2,577.2 $ 2,600.0 $ 2,075.0 $ 16,649.4 Estimated cash payments for interest (2) $ 20,370.2 $ 1,073.3 $ 2,059.5 $ 1,825.0 $ 15,412.4 Operating lease obligations (3) $ 438.0 $ 57.1 $ 96.8 $ 78.2 $ 205.9 Purchase obligations: (4) Product purchase commitments: Estimated payment obligations: Natural gas $ 3,467.5 $ 912.5 $ 1,545.1 $ 1,009.9 $ -- NGLs $ 140.9 $ 68.5 $ 72.4 $ -- $ -- Crude oil $ 1,412.7 $ 421.7 $ 702.7 $ 183.4 $ 104.9 Petrochemicals and refined products $ 514.3 $ 202.5 $ 308.8 $ 3.0 $ -- Other $ 46.0 $ 9.5 $ 18.8 $ 12.5 $ 5.2 Underlying major volume commitments: Natural gas (in TBtus) 992 261 445 286 -- NGLs (in MMBbls) 13 6 7 -- -- Crude oil (in MMBbls) 27 8 13 4 2 Petrochemicals and refined products (in MMBbls) 18 7 11 -- -- Service payment commitments (5) $ 585.2 $ 180.6 $ 192.6 $ 102.9 $ 109.1 Capital expenditure commitments (6) $ 57.8 $ 57.8 $ -- $ -- $ -- Other long-term liabilities (7) $ 503.9 $ -- $ 52.1 $ 302.8 $ 149.0 Total contractual payment obligations $ 51,438.1 $ 5,560.7 $ 7,648.8 $ 5,592.7 $ 32,635.9 (1) Represents scheduled future maturities of our consolidated debt principal obligations. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2016, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable fixed or variable interest rates paid during 2016. With respect to our variable-rate debt obligations, we applied the weighted-average interest rate paid during 2016 to determine the estimated cash payments. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for the weighted-average variable interest rate charged in 2016 in connection with our commercial paper program. In general, our estimated cash payments for interest are significantly influenced by the long-term maturities of our junior subordinated notes (due August 2066 through January 2068). Our estimated cash payments for interest with respect to each junior subordinated note are based on the current fixed interest rate for each note applied to the entire remaining term through the respective maturity date. (3) Primarily represents land held pursuant to right-of-way agreements and property leases, leases of underground salt dome caverns for the storage of natural gas and NGLs, the lease of transportation equipment used in our operations and office space with affiliates of EPCO. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services as of December 31, 2016. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2016 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Primarily represents our unconditional payment obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts. (6) Represents unconditional payment obligations for services to be rendered or products to be delivered in connection with our capital spending program, including our share of the capital spending of our unconsolidated affiliates. (7) As reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016, “Other long-term liabilities” primarily represent the Liquidity Option Agreement, the noncurrent portion of asset retirement obligations and deferred revenues. In connection with the agreements to acquire EFS Midstream, we are obligated to spend up to an aggregate of $270 million on specified midstream gathering assets for PXD and Reliance, if requested by these producers, over a ten-year period. If constructed, these new assets would be owned by us and be a component of the EFS Midstream System. As of December 31, 2016, we have spent approximately $133 million of the $270 million commitment. Due to the uncertain timing of the remaining potential capital expenditures, we have excluded this amount from the preceding table. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 102 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. General In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding and the discount rates used to determine the present values. The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming: § the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk; § the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and § the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period. We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. Accordingly, the nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed. 103 Table of Contents See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. Commodity Hedging Activities The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps, basis swaps and option contracts. The following table summarizes our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2016 (volume measures as noted): Volume (1) Accounting Derivative Purpose Current (2) Long-Term (2) Treatment Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas processing: Forecasted natural gas purchases for plant thermal reduction (Bcf) 21.6 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs (MMBbls) (3) 4.3 n/a Cash flow hedge Octane enhancement: Forecasted purchase of NGLs (MMBbls) 1.4 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of octane enhancement products (MMBbls) 1.3 n/a Cash flow hedge Natural gas marketing: Forecasted purchases of natural gas for fuel (Bcf) 1.8 n/a Cash flow hedge Natural gas storage inventory management activities (Bcf) 8.0 n/a Fair value hedge NGL marketing: Forecasted purchases of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 101.9 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 124.1 n/a Cash flow hedge Refined products marketing: Forecasted purchases of refined products (MMBbls) 0.5 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of refined products (MMBbls) 0.5 n/a Cash flow hedge Refined products inventory management activities (MMBbls) 1.2 n/a Fair value hedge Crude oil marketing: Forecasted purchases of crude oil (MMBbls) 11.5 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of crude oil (MMBbls) 17.1 n/a Cash flow hedge Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas risk management activities (Bcf) (4, 5) 156.6 8.3 Mark-to-market NGL risk management activities (MMBbls) (5) 18.7 n/a Mark-to-market Refined products risk management activities (MMBbls) (5) 0.1 n/a Mark-to-market Crude oil risk management activities (MMBbls) (5) 27.8 n/a Mark-to-market (1) Volume for derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflects the total amount of volumes hedged whereas volume for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflects the absolute value of derivative notional volumes. (2) The maximum term for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is December 2017, June 2017 and March 2020, respectively. (3) Forecasted NGL sales volumes under Natural gas processing exclude 1.2 MMBbls of additional hedges executed under contracts that have been designated as normal sales agreements. (4) Current and long-term volumes include 35.3 Bcf and 0.9 Bcf, respectively, of physical derivative instruments that are predominantly priced at a marked-based index plus a premium or minus a discount related to location differences. (5) Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with transportation, processing and storage assets. At December 31, 2016, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging natural gas processing margins and (iii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory. § The objective of our anticipated future commodity purchases and sales hedging program is to hedge the margins of certain transportation, storage, blending and operational activities by locking in purchase and sale prices through the use of derivative instruments and related contracts. 104 Table of Contents § The objective of our natural gas processing hedging program is to hedge an amount of earnings associated with these activities. We achieve this objective by executing fixed-price sales for a portion of our expected equity NGL production using derivative instruments and related contracts. For certain natural gas processing contracts, the hedging of expected equity NGL production also involves the purchase of natural gas for plant thermal reduction, which is hedged using derivative instruments and related contracts. § The objective of our inventory hedging program is to hedge the fair value of commodity products currently held in inventory by locking in the sales price of the inventory through the use of derivative instruments and related contracts. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our natural gas marketing portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2015 December 31, 2016 January 31, 2017 Fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ 0.1 $ (5.3 ) $ 0.1 Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Liability (3.7 ) (9.7 ) (3.6 ) Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 3.9 (0.9 ) 3.9 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our NGL marketing, refined products marketing and octane enhancement portfolios at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2015 December 31, 2016 January 31, 2017 Fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ 69.6 $ (150.3 ) $ 13.9 Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 41.7 (227.7 ) (23.8 ) Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 97.4 (73.0 ) 51.7 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our crude oil marketing portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2015 December 31, 2016 January 31, 2017 Fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ 42.9 $ (42.4 ) $ (22.1 ) Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 25.9 (80.0 ) (70.2 ) Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 60.0 (4.7 ) 26.1 Interest Rate Hedging Activities We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain consolidated debt agreements. This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. The composition of our derivative instrument portfolios may change depending on our hedging requirements. With respect to the tabular data below, each portfolio’s estimated fair value at a given date is based on a number of factors, including the number and types of derivatives outstanding at that date, the notional value of the swaps and associated interest rates. 105 Table of Contents Interest rate swaps exchange the stated interest rate paid on a notional amount of existing debt for the fixed or floating interest rate stipulated in the derivative instrument.

Overview of Business We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.” We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. Our midstream energy operations currently include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and export and import terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases, or “LPG,” and ethane); crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and export and import terminals; petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, export and import terminals, and related services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems. Our assets currently include approximately 50,000 miles of pipelines; 260 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products; and 14 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity. We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. We, Enterprise GP, EPCO and Dan Duncan LLC are affiliates under the collective common control of the DD LLC Trustees and the EPCO Trustees. Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the “ASA”) or by other service providers. Our operations are reported under four business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services and (iv) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our related marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measure, for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. 65 Table of Contents Significant Recent Developments Issuance of $2.0 Billion of Senior Notes and $700 Million of Junior Subordinated Notes in February 2018 In February 2018, EPO issued $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of notes comprised of (i) $750 million principal amount of senior notes due February 15, 2021 (“Senior Notes TT”), (ii) $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes due February 15, 2048 (“Senior Notes UU”) and (iii) $700 million principal amount of junior subordinated notes due February 15, 2078 (“Junior Subordinated Notes F”). Net proceeds from these offerings were used by EPO for the temporary repayment of amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program, general company purposes, and the expected redemption of all $682.7 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 7.034% Junior Subordinated Notes B (the “7.034% Notes”). Senior Notes TT were issued at 99.946% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 2.80% per year. Senior Notes UU were issued at 99.865% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 4.25% per year. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has guaranteed the senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis. The Junior Subordinated Notes F are redeemable at EPO’s option, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, on or after February 15, 2028 at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.375% per year through February 14, 2028. Beginning February 15, 2028, the Junior Subordinated Notes F will bear interest at a floating rate based on a three-month LIBOR rate plus 2.57%, reset quarterly. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has guaranteed the Junior Subordinated Notes F through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and subordinated basis. The redemption of the 7.034% Notes and the issuance of the 5.375% Junior Subordinated Notes F will result in annual interest savings to EPO of approximately $11.3 million. On February 1, 2018, EPO notified its trustee and paying agent to redeem all of the $682.7 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 7.034% Notes. EPO anticipates that the 7.034% Notes will be redeemed on or about March 5, 2018, in accordance with the terms of the 7.034% Notes, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. Plans to Build Ethylene Export Dock and Related Projects In January 2018, we announced the formation of a new 50/50 joint venture with Navigator Holdings Ltd. (“Navigator”) to construct, own and operate an ethylene export facility along the U.S. Gulf Coast. The export facility is expected to have the capacity to export approximately 1 million tons of ethylene per year, with loading rates of approximately 1,000 tons per hour. In addition, the facility is expected to include refrigerated storage for 30,000 tons of ethylene. The project, which is underwritten by long-term contracts with customers, is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020. The location and final investment decisions for the terminal are subject to reaching acceptable arrangements with local taxing authorities. In April 2017, we announced two expansion projects that will further develop our ethylene infrastructure in the Houston, Texas area. First, we plan to repurpose a large, high-capacity ethane storage well at our Mont Belvieu, Texas complex into ethylene storage. Following completion of this project, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018, the 5.3 MMBbl cavern will be able to inject/withdraw ethylene at a rate of 210,000 pounds per hour (or approximately 2,000 barrels per hour) and is expandable to 420,000 pounds per hour (or approximately 4,000 barrels per hour). There are eight third party ethylene pipelines within a half-mile of the ethylene storage system, providing significant connectivity opportunities for the high-capacity system. Further supporting our ethylene capabilities, we also plan to build a 24-mile, 12-inch or larger diameter ethylene pipeline extending from Mont Belvieu to Bayport, Texas. The new pipeline would have the potential to connect both producing and consuming customers located south of the Houston Ship Channel to our facility in Mont Belvieu. 66 Table of Contents Enterprise to Expand Butane Isomerization Facility In January 2018, we announced plans to expand our butane isomerization facility by up to 30 MBPD of incremental capacity. This expansion is supported by new long-term agreements, including a 20-year, 35 MBPD fee-based, tolling arrangement, to provide butane isomerization, storage and pipeline services. Enterprise to Expand Orla Natural Gas Processing Complex in West Texas In January 2018, we announced plans to add 300 MMcf/d of incremental capacity at our cryogenic natural gas processing facility under construction near Orla, Texas in Reeves County. The addition of a third processing train at Orla (“Orla III”) would increase inlet volume capacity to 900 MMcf/d and allow us to expand our NGL extraction capabilities by an incremental 40 MBPD to 120 MBPD. Orla III is expected to begin service in the third quarter of 2019. In June 2017, we announced plans to add a second processing train (“Orla II”) to our cryogenic natural gas processing facility currently under construction near Orla, Texas in Reeves County. Orla II is expected to add 300 MMcf/d of incremental processing capacity to the facility and double the inlet capacity of the facility to 600 MMcf/d and increase extraction of NGLs from up to 40 MBPD to up to 80 MBPD. Orla II is expected to begin service in the fourth quarter of 2018. Mixed NGLs extracted at the Orla facility will be delivered into our fully integrated NGL system, including the recently announced Shin Oak NGL Pipeline (or “Shin Oak”). Residue natural gas volumes from the facility will be transported to the Waha area through our Texas Intrastate system. The Orla facility is designed to support the continued growth in NGL-rich natural gas production from the Delaware Basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico and is supported by long-term customer commitments. Enterprise Management Provides Guidance with Regards to Distribution Growth through 2018 In October 2017, our management announced plans to recommend to the Board cash distribution increases per quarter of $0.0025 per unit with respect to each of the six fiscal quarters beginning with the third quarter of 2017 and ending with the fourth quarter of 2018. The Board declared a $0.4225 per common unit cash distribution to limited partners with respect to the third quarter of 2017, which was paid on November 7, 2017. The Board declared a $0.425 per common unit cash distribution to limited partners with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017, which was paid on February 7, 2018. Management currently expects to recommend to the Board the following quarterly cash distributions with respect to each quarter of 2018: $0.4275, first quarter of 2018; $0.4300, second quarter of 2018; $0.4325, third quarter of 2018; and $0.4350, fourth quarter of 2018. The recommended distribution growth rate should further strengthen our distribution coverage, increase our retained distributable cash flow available to fund growth capital opportunities, and reduce unitholder dilution by decreasing the amount of equity we may need to issue. Management believes that moderation in the growth rate of our near-term cash distributions should enhance our ability to be self-funding for the equity portion of capital expenditures by 2019. The payment of any quarterly cash distribution is subject to Board approval and management’s evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in connection with such payment. Management will propose recommendations to the Board regarding our cash distribution growth rate for 2019 as we consider future investment opportunities and alternatives for returning capital to investors. Plans to Build Shin Oak NGL Pipeline In April 2017, we announced plans to build Shin Oak, a 24-inch diameter pipeline, to transport growing NGL production from the Permian Basin to our NGL fractionation and storage complex located in Mont Belvieu, Texas. The Shin Oak NGL Pipeline is expected to have an initial design capacity of 250 MBPD and be expandable up to 600 MBPD. The project is supported by long-term shipper commitments and is expected to be placed into service during the second quarter of 2019. 67 Table of Contents Completion of Azure Acquisition In April 2017, we closed on the acquisition of a midstream energy business from Azure Midstream Partners, LP and its operating subsidiaries (collectively, “Azure”) for $191.4 million in cash. The acquired business assets, which are located primarily in East Texas, include over 750 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and two natural gas processing facilities with an aggregate processing capacity of 130 MMcf/d. The acquired business serves production from the Haynesville Shale and Bossier, Cotton Valley and Travis Peak formations. For additional information regarding the Azure acquisition, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Plans to Build Ninth NGL Fractionator at Our Mont Belvieu, Texas Complex In March 2017, we resumed construction of our ninth NGL fractionator at our Mont Belvieu, Texas complex in anticipation of increased NGL production from the Permian Basin. The new fractionator, which is expected to be completed by mid-2018, would have a nameplate capacity of 85 MBPD. Upon completion of this expansion project, we would have approximately 755 MBPD of total NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex and a combined 1.2 MMBPD of capacity across all of our NGL fractionators. Plans to Construct Isobutane Dehydrogenation Unit at Mont Belvieu In January 2017, we announced plans to construct a new isobutane dehydrogenation (“iBDH”) unit at our Mont Belvieu complex that is expected to have the capability to produce 425,000 tons per year of isobutylene. The project, which is underwritten by long-term contracts with investment-grade customers, is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. Isobutylene produced by the new plant will provide additional feedstocks for our downstream octane enhancement and petrochemical facilities. Historically, steam crackers and refineries have been the major source of propane and butane olefins for downstream use. However, with the increased use of light-end feedstocks, specifically ethane, the need for on-purpose olefins production has increased. Like our propane dehydrogenation (“PDH”) facility, the iBDH plant will help meet market demand where traditional supplies have been reduced. The new iBDH plant will increase our production of high purity and low purity isobutylene, which are used as feedstock to manufacture lubricants, rubber products and alkylate for gasoline blendstock, as well as methyl tertiary butyl ether for export. General Outlook for 2018 Commercial Outlook General Commodity Price Observations As a result of significant advances in non-conventional drilling and production technology, North American reserves and production of hydrocarbons, primarily from shale resource basins such as the Permian Basin in West Texas, the Eagle Ford in South Texas and the Appalachia Basin in the Northeast U.S., increased substantially in recent years. The significant increase in U.S. hydrocarbon supplies has led to lower prices, a reduction in imports, and, in many cases significantly increased exports; in fact, the U.S. is rapidly turning into a major exporter of various hydrocarbons including natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. 68 Table of Contents In response to the growing supplies, beginning in November 2014, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”), opted to defend its market share by maintaining (and in some cases increasing) its crude oil production levels rather than their previous practice of cutting production to balance global markets. The result was bloated global inventories of crude oil and products and a dramatic decline in global crude oil prices from an average of $93 per barrel in 2014, to $49 per barrel in 2015 and further to $43 per barrel in 2016, as measured by the price of West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”). Prices reached a low of approximately $26 per barrel in February 2016. In September 2016, as a result of continued negative market sentiment on crude oil prices, OPEC members began discussing an output “freeze” to try to balance global markets and reduce excess crude oil inventories. In November 2016, OPEC members formally agreed to production cuts, starting January 1, 2017, that have significantly reduced the global crude oil supply overhang. As of the end of November 2017, oil stocks in the 35 member countries comprising the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (or “OECD”) decreased by an aggregate 35 million barrels (or 3%) when compared to data from the end of 2016. Likewise, total refined products stocks in OECD countries decreased by 62 million (or 4%) when compared to data from year-end 2016. OPEC members met again in December 2017 and agreed to extend the freeze into 2018, and are expected to meet again in the summer of 2018 to review market conditions and the impact of the freeze on global balances. In addition to OPEC members, certain non-OPEC producers including Russia have agreed to participate in the production cuts, which has further strengthened crude oil and related energy commodity prices. As a general rule, there has been a high level of compliance with the OPEC production quotas and global inventories of crude oil and related products have fallen significantly. In addition to the OPEC-led production cuts, most industry experts expect that strong consumer demand for energy and related products due to the lower prices (combined with routine supply disruptions) will accelerate rebalancing of the global oil market, with daily demand exceeding supply as early as the second half of 2018. With the announced cuts and positive supply and demand trends, industry experts estimate that WTI prices will average $50 to $60 per barrel between now and 2020. Likewise, natural gas prices have also experienced significant weakness in recent years as a result of excess domestic supplies and warmer than average winters. As measured by the NYMEX at Henry Hub, natural gas prices averaged $4.26 per MMBtu in 2014, $2.63 per MMBtu in 2015, $2.55 per MMBtu in 2016 and $3.02 per MMBtu in 2017. For the start of 2018, natural gas prices at Henry Hub averaged $3.00 per MMBtu through mid-February 2018. In response to lower energy commodity prices, domestic producers significantly reduced both their drilling and completion activities in most production basins starting in early 2015. As a result of reduced drilling, domestic crude oil production at the end of 2016 was 840 MBPD lower than its previous peak in June 2015; however, with improved prices in 2017 and significant technical and efficiency gains, production of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas has been steadily increasing and, in fact, is at record production levels. As a result of higher energy commodity prices in 2017 and continued positive sentiment towards price stability, we expect an increase in producer investment and drilling and well completion activities during 2018 in and around our assets in the Permian, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Rockies regions. Furthermore, we expect that our assets in these areas will be very competitive in supplying services for the resulting new production. We also believe that basins located closest to prime markets on the U.S. Gulf Coast will be preferred by producers due to more favorable economics as compared to other more distant areas (mostly due to lower transportation costs). Supply Side Observations During 2017, we saw a continuation of the upstream industry’s shift to shale resource basins, away from long lead-time projects. Even the major oil companies shifted their investments towards the shale plays. We believe that because projects in U.S. shale resource basins exhibit a low risk, short lead time production profile, the U.S. shale resources will continue to play an increasing role in both domestic and global markets. Many energy economists also believe that outside of some limited excess production capacity within OPEC, U.S. shale production is now the world’s swing crude oil supply. 69 Table of Contents Crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices were significantly higher in 2017, compared to 2016 and 2015, although far below peak levels seen in 2014. Nonetheless, U.S. exploration and production (“E&P”) companies have shown that they can grow shale production at a crude oil price of $50/bbl. Oilfield service and E&P companies continue to improve technologies to drill and complete non-conventional wells more efficiently. Some of these improvements include faster drilling, longer horizontal laterals, and higher density fracture treatments. Improved technology has enabled E&P companies to realize higher returns on capital from developing non-conventional resources at lower energy prices. Rig counts increased rapidly in the first half of 2017. As more wells were drilled, most basins experienced a shortage of completion equipment and crews, forcing producers to defer completions and build their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells (“DUCs”). The DUC count grew by over 2,000 wells from December 2016 to December 2017, to a total of nearly 7,500 wells, as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This represents a significant potential volume which we believe could be brought into production starting in 2018. NGL volumes will likely grow proportionately faster than either crude oil or natural gas volumes, as the mix of drilling has continued to shift to crude oil wells and richer natural gas wells. While changes in drilling rig counts (as reported by Baker Hughes) have historically been a reliable leading indicator of future production growth or decline, recent developments in technology, high grading of drilling locations and the large inventory of DUCs have reduced the correlation between changes in rig counts and changes in production. We believe this to be especially true when comparing current rig counts to those prior to 2015. Rig counts continue, however, to be a reliable indicator of overall E&P activity and investment. U.S. E&P company sentiment continued to improve in 2017 as the OPEC production freeze had a high level of compliance and storage levels indicated a return to global supply-demand balance. Since May 2016, total U.S. drilling rig counts have increased by 542 rigs, or 134%, to 946 rigs as of February 2018. The crude oil rig count increased by 449 to 765 rigs, an increase of 142% from the low in May 2016. Likewise, the natural gas rig count increased by 100 rigs, or 123%, from the low in August 2016. Not all regions have reacted equally to the recovery in rig counts, with the largest increases seen in the Permian Basin and SCOOP/STACK play in Oklahoma. In the second half of 2017, rig count growth stabilized, however, we believe the current rig count is enough to continue to grow production, even without completion of a significant number of DUCs or further increases in productivity. Permian Outlook The Permian Basin in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico has experienced the largest increase in drilling activity in the country, with the number of active rigs increasing from 134 in April 2016 to 427 in February 2018. The Permian Basin is an oil prone basin with many attributes, including stacked pay zones, light sweet crude oil and a long history of support for the oil and gas industry. The current level of producer activity provides support for the construction of incremental midstream infrastructure in the basin. An area of focus for us has been the development of midstream infrastructure serving producers in the Delaware Basin, which is part of the overall Permian Basin. The Delaware Basin historically has been a relatively lightly drilled area due to a lack of conventional targets. With the introduction of horizontal drilling and identification of stacked targets of tight-rock and shales, Delaware Basin drilling has accelerated over the past five years. These drilling targets have proven to produce not only light crude oil but also lighter and gassier hydrocarbons such as condensate and NGLs. These gassier hydrocarbons have presented to us a large number of midstream opportunities to provide services to producers in the Delaware Basin. We are diligently working to identify attractive midstream prospects from these opportunities to complement our current asset infrastructure. During 2017, we completed and placed into service two natural gas processing facilities (South Eddy and Waha) and are constructing three additional plants near Orla, Texas in the Delaware Basin. Two of the Orla plants (Orla I and II) are expected to start up in 2018 and one (Orla III) in 2019. When the Orla plants are completed we will operate approximately 1.3 Bcf/d of processing in the Permian Basin, which are all highly integrated with other Enterprise natural gas and NGL assets, including our Shin Oak NGL pipeline that is currently under construction. In addition, we placed into limited service a major crude oil pipeline system, the Midland-to-ECHO Pipeline System that serves producers in the Permian Basin and originates at our Midland, Texas crude oil terminal and extends to our Sealy, Texas terminal and on to our ECHO terminal near Houston, Texas. We are also evaluating several other natural gas, NGL and crude oil projects in the Permian Basin. 70 Table of Contents Eagle Ford outlook Rig counts in the Eagle Ford shale region were significantly impacted by the downturn in crude oil prices and producers allocating their capital budgets to other producing basins, especially the Permian. With that being said, the number of active drilling rigs in the Eagle Ford shale has increased by 37 rigs, or 128%, to 66 rigs in February 2018 from the low recorded in May 2016. The historical peak for Eagle Ford Region crude oil and natural gas production occurred in March 2015 and was 1.7 MMBPD and 7.4 Bcf/d, respectively. According to the EIA Drilling Productivity Report, the most recent data (January 2018) for Eagle Ford Region production was 1.2 MMBPD of crude oil and 6.4 Bcf/d of natural gas. Until volumes for the Eagle Ford return to near historical peak production, there will be excess capacity in terms of midstream infrastructure available in the region. We believe that the Eagle Ford offers producers some of the best returns on capital of any region in the country and is also favorably situated near growing consumption and export markets on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Several large parcels of producing acreage have changed hands in recent years, which has resulted in a number of rigs being put back into service since the new owners are eager to begin realizing cash flows from their investments. We believe further ownership changes will take place in the near future that will increase the number of rigs working in the Eagle Ford, which could result in higher volumes for our assets. Haynesville Outlook The rig count in the Haynesville shale has grown in 2017 as a result of increased public and private equity investment in the region. We have seen several significant changes in the ownership of producing properties over the past year, which has led to increased drilling activity in the region by the new owners. From the low of 11 rigs recorded in February 2016, the Haynesville rig count has increased by 36 rigs, or 327%, to 47 rigs in February 2018. Drilling in the Haynesville has additionally benefitted from advances in drilling and completion technology (increased well lateral length, adding more fracking stages, significantly increased proppant concentration) resulting in improved natural gas recoveries per well and increased returns on capital for producers. The historical peak for the Haynesville region natural gas production occurred in November 2011 and was over 10.6 Bcf/d. According to the most recent EIA drilling Productivity Report (January 2018), the Haynesville Region natural gas production was 7.7 Bcf/d. In 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that the Haynesville and associated Bossier shale plays hold a combined 304 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas resources, the second highest level in the U.S. after the Appalachia region. In addition, the Haynesville benefits from its close proximity to the Gulf Coast where substantial petrochemical and liquefied natural gas, or LNG, export buildout is underway. With natural gas futures prices currently at approximately $3.00 per MMBtu, we anticipate Haynesville gas production will continue growing. Until Haynesville volumes return to near historical peak production, there is generally excess capacity of midstream infrastructure available in the region. Rockies Outlook Rig counts have increased in the major basins of the Rockies. Drilling activity in the Piceance Basin increased from two rigs in May 2016 to eight rigs in February 2018, and in the Jonah and Pinedale fields increased from a combined four rigs in November 2016 to 12 rigs in February 2018. Drilling activity in the San Juan Basin increased from two rigs in November 2015 to three rigs in February 2018. The current level of drilling and completion activity in the Rockies is generally leading to growth in production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. In addition, early results from horizontal drilling in both Jonah and Pinedale fields are very promising for incremental natural gas and NGL production. The Rockies benefit from adequate natural gas and NGL pipeline infrastructure, which helps the region compete with other North American plays where takeaway capacity may be constrained. Like the Eagle Ford and Haynesville, we have seen several significant changes in the ownership of producing properties over the past year, which has led to increased drilling activity in the region by the new owners. Demand Side Observations Global demand for petroleum-based products continues to increase at rates that have generally exceeded economists’ expectations, which is in large part due to improving economic growth worldwide. Due to higher crude oil prices and improved drilling and production techniques, U.S. crude oil production has bounced back and secured its place in the global supply. As a result, we expect that some of these new domestic barrels would supplant more of the U.S.’s crude oil imports while the remainder would be exported to growing international markets in Central and South America, Asia and Western Europe where the lighter U.S. crudes make good feedstocks for their refining facilities. We also expect U.S. refineries to operate at higher rates as a result of strong U.S. demand and growing exports of refined products. 71 Table of Contents We believe that our marine terminal assets and related infrastructure –storage and pipelines- are strategically located on the U.S. Gulf Coast to take advantage of the shift mentioned above: growing production resulting in reduced crude oil imports and higher exports of crude oil and refined products. These assets could benefit from concurrent imports and exports of various grades of crude oil as (i) refineries optimize their crude oil input slate, (ii) trading companies import and export different grades of crude oil depending on global and regional supply-demand factors, and (iii) producers optimize their production depending on market price signals. Enterprise has significant crude oil export capabilities on the Houston Ship Channel and at Beaumont, Freeport and Texas City. Towards the end of 2017, we began limited service on the Midland-to-ECHO crude oil pipeline which will complement our existing assets and allow for the transportation, storage and export of segregated barrels, thus maintaining and assuring the quality and grade of the final product. This is in contrast to an operation relying on mixed streams of various oil qualities and grades. However, this outlook could be muted if there is a prolonged decline in domestic crude oil production or if overseas crude markets become oversupplied for an extended period. We expect demand for ethane to grow further as several new world-scale ethylene plants begin operations in the U.S. through the early 2020s, which in turn could drive upstream NGL production increases. We also expect continued increase in global demand for heavier NGLs (butanes and natural gasoline) supported by rising global economic activity. With respect to natural gas demand, we expect it to continue to increase in the form of U.S. power generation demand, growing industrial demand, exports to Mexico and as LNG. We believe U.S. producers can provide ample supplies of natural gas at very competitive prices to meet growing global demand. In recent years, U.S. natural gas and NGLs developed a feedstock price advantage over more costly crude oil derivatives (such as naphtha and gasoil). In general, we expect this trend to continue due to: (i) competitive domestic production from low risk, short lead time shale resource plays; (ii) the ability of U.S. producers and their suppliers to harness technology to keep costs down; (iii) anticipated long-term increases in demand for crude oil by developing economies; and (iv) ongoing geopolitical risks and poor rule of law in many countries that are major exporters of crude oil. These advantages lend themselves to a variety of long-term demand-side opportunities, including higher demand from the U.S. petrochemical industry and increased exports of various hydrocarbons (e.g., LNG, LPG, ethane and crude oil). We also believe the trend in the feedstock price advantage of domestically-produced NGLs and their abundance has led to a long-term fundamental change in feedstock selection by the U.S. petrochemical industry, which is the largest consumer of domestic NGLs. In order to capitalize on this cost advantage, U.S. petrochemical companies have maximized their consumption of domestic NGLs. Many of these companies are investing billions of dollars to construct world-scale ethylene plants on the Gulf Coast that are designed to consume NGLs (particularly ethane) as feedstock. U.S. ethylene production capacity is expected to increase by over 40% between 2016 and 2020. Below is a list of ethylene plants that either have been recently completed or are under construction and expected to begin operations over the next few years based on publicly available information. Company Ethylene Production Capacity Potential Ethane Consumption Estimated Completion Date (Billion lbs/yr) (MBPD) Occidental Chemical/Mexichem 1.2 40 Operational Dow Chemical 3.3 90 Operational Chevron Phillips Chemical 3.3 90 1Q 2018 ExxonMobil Chemical 3.3 90 1Q 2018 Indorama 1.1 30 2018 Shintech 1.1 30 2018 Sasol 3.3 90 2018 Formosa Plastics 3.5 95 2019 Axiall/Lotte 2.2 60 2019 Total Petrochemicals & Refining 2.2 60 Early 2020s Shell 3.5 95 Early 2020s Total 28.0 770 72 Table of Contents Additionally, several other petrochemical companies have announced large scale expansions and/or conversions at existing facilities that will use ethane as feedstock. Almost all of these ethylene plants as well as the major expansions are in close proximity to our existing or planned assets, including our recently completed Aegis Ethane Pipeline. Based on industry publications, U.S. production of ethylene in 2015 and 2016 averaged 155 million pounds per day. In 2017, U.S. ethylene production averaged 160 million pounds per day despite devastating disruption from Hurricane Harvey, which caused the industry operating rate in September to dip below 70%. Ethane is the most widely used feedstock by the U.S. petrochemical industry in the production of ethylene; ethane consumption by domestic petrochemical companies has, at times, been in excess of 1.2 MMBPD. We believe the U.S. ethylene industry could consume approximately 200 MBPD of additional ethane feedstocks over the next few years through modifications, debottlenecking and expansions at existing facilities. In addition, we believe that publicly announced new petrochemical plant projects, including those noted in the preceding table, could consume well over 700 MBPD of additional ethane feedstocks when completed. However, until these new ethylene plants are completed, ethane production capacity continues to exceed demand, resulting in significant volumes of ethane not being extracted from the natural gas stream by producers and natural gas processors in an effort to balance ethane supply with demand. In response to growing international demand for U.S. ethane, we placed into service our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal in September 2016. Abundant U.S. ethane from shale plays offers the global petrochemical industry a low-cost feedstock option and supply diversification from a stable producer. The Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, located on the Houston Ship Channel, is the largest of its kind in the world, has an aggregate loading rate (nameplate capacity) of approximately 10,000 barrels per hour of fully refrigerated ethane, and is integrated with our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation and storage complex. U.S. exports of LPG continue to increase as a result of ample domestic production, increased export capacity and competitive, transparent pricing when compared to international markets. Overall, U.S. propane waterborne exports increased from approximately 423 MBPD in 2014 to approximately 875 MBPD in 2016 and 989 MBPD in 2017. Markets in Northwest Europe, Central and South America were traditionally the main destination for U.S. LPG exports. However, starting in 2016 a shift towards Asia was underway such that in 2017 exports to Asia have taken the center stage as countries like China and India experience solid and consistent demand growth. For example, Enterprise’s exports of LPG to Asia accounted for 14% of that region’s total imports in 2016, but in 2017 that figure jumped to 43%. We believe that various factors have favored this rapid tilt towards Asia: (i) continued economic expansion in emerging Asian markets; (ii) the widening of the Panama Canal, which was completed in 2016; and (iii) favorable domestic policies in countries like India and Indonesia where the governments are subsidizing the switch to LPG for domestic use as a means for reducing pollution and protecting against deforestation. In anticipation of the aforementioned growth in LPG exports, we completed the final phase of the expansion of our LPG export terminal located on the Houston Ship Channel at EHT in December 2015. This expansion increased our loading rate for LPG at the terminal to approximately 27,500 barrels per hour (nameplate capacity). We believe that the U.S. has plentiful supplies of natural gas at very competitive prices. Associated natural gas production from crude oil supply basins tends to be the lowest in cost followed by rich gas plays. However, with enough demand pull, supply basins with dry natural gas, such as the Haynesville/Bossier, Barnett, Fayetteville, Piceance and Jonah/Pinedale, could experience an increase in drilling activity due to their low development costs. The Haynesville resource basin is an excellent example of a dry gas production area that we believe could experience a substantial increase in drilling activity since it is ideally located to serve future demand from LNG exports and industrial customers on the U.S. Gulf Coast. We believe that natural gas prices will tend to stay around $3.00 per MMBtu as there is enough supply to satisfy future demand, both domestic and exports (piped gas to Mexico and waterborne LNG). 73 Table of Contents Summary While this period of very low prices has been very difficult for producers, the lower energy prices have led to an increase in energy consumption by consumers, particularly for motor fuels, and by energy intensive industries (e.g., steel manufacturing and petrochemicals) as lower energy and feedstock costs reduce operating costs for their businesses making them more globally competitive. We believe that the ongoing production freeze by OPEC and Russia coupled with an increase in demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs from these types of industries, will continue to balance crude oil supply and demand fundamentals and further reduce the overhang of global inventories in 2018. Regardless of such market dynamics, almost all of the major assets we have under construction or have recently completed, whether supply or demand oriented, are supported by long-term fee-based commitments from producers, shippers and/or end-use customers. We also believe that as a result of the price downturn which has slowed and/or caused many higher-risk, long-lead time upstream projects to be cancelled, U.S. unconventional resources have gained substantial long-term significance worldwide and that the U.S. is going to continue to grow in significance as a supplier of hydrocarbons to other nations, particularly in Latin America, Europe and Asia. Liquidity Outlook Debt and equity capital markets for the energy sector remained turbulent throughout 2017 as continued volatility and weakness in commodity prices created market uncertainty. This has generally impacted both our cost of capital and access to debt and equity capital markets. While there were challenges in the capital markets during 2017, we were able to access both the debt and equity capital markets to support our growth and balance sheet objectives at acceptable costs. At December 31, 2017, we had $3.75 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $3.74 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $5.1 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations, and access to capital markets and bank capital to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. In February 2018, we issued $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and junior subordinated notes and used the net proceeds therefrom for the temporary repayment of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and for the expected redemption of our Junior Subordinated Notes B. For information regarding these debt offerings, see “Significant Recent Developments” within this Item 7. We have two series of senior notes maturing in April and May of 2018 that have a combined principal amount of $1.1 billion. We expect to refinance these senior notes at or near their maturity. After that, our next maturing series of senior notes are due in January and October of 2019 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. The U.S. government is expected to continue to run substantial annual budget deficits in the coming years that will require a corresponding issuance of debt by the U.S. Treasury. The interest rate on U.S. Treasury debt has a direct impact on the cost of our debt. At this time, we are uncertain what impact the expected large issuances of U.S. Treasury debt and the prevailing economic and capital market conditions during these future periods will have on the cost and availability of capital. We continue to monitor and evaluate the condition of the capital markets and our interest rate risk with respect to funding our capital spending program and refinancing upcoming maturities. For information regarding our interest rate hedging activities, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 74 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table summarizes the key components of our results of operations for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Revenues $ 29,241.5 $ 23,022.3 $ 27,027.9 Costs and expenses: Operating costs and expenses: Cost of sales 21,487.0 15,710.9 19,612.9 Other operating costs and expenses 2,500.1 2,425.6 2,449.4 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 1,531.3 1,456.7 1,428.2 Net losses (gains) attributable to asset sales (10.7 ) (2.5 ) 15.6 Asset impairment and related charges 49.8 52.8 162.6 Total operating costs and expenses 25,557.5 19,643.5 23,668.7 General and administrative costs 181.1 160.1 192.6 Total costs and expenses 25,738.6 19,803.6 23,861.3 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 426.0 362.0 373.6 Operating income 3,928.9 3,580.7 3,540.2 Interest expense (984.6 ) (982.6 ) (961.8 ) Change in fair market value of Liquidity Option Agreement (64.3 ) (24.5 ) (25.4 ) Other, net 1.3 2.8 2.9 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (25.7 ) (23.4 ) 2.5 Net income 2,855.6 2,553.0 2,558.4 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (56.3 ) (39.9 ) (37.2 ) Net income attributable to limited partners $ 2,799.3 $ 2,513.1 $ 2,521.2 The following table presents each business segment’s contribution to consolidated revenues for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 NGL Pipelines & Services: Sales of NGLs and related products $ 10,521.3 $ 8,380.5 $ 8,044.8 Midstream services 1,946.7 1,862.0 1,743.2 Total 12,468.0 10,242.5 9,788.0 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services: Sales of crude oil 7,365.2 5,802.5 9,732.9 Midstream services 791.6 712.5 573.0 Total 8,156.8 6,515.0 10,305.9 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services: Sales of natural gas 2,238.5 1,591.9 1,722.6 Midstream services 907.1 951.1 1,020.7 Total 3,145.6 2,543.0 2,743.3 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services: Sales of petrochemicals and refined products 4,696.3 2,921.9 3,333.5 Midstream services 774.8 799.9 778.4 Total 5,471.1 3,721.8 4,111.9 Offshore Pipelines & Services: (1) Sales of crude oil -- -- 3.2 Midstream services -- -- 75.6 Total -- -- 78.8 Total consolidated revenues $ 29,241.5 $ 23,022.3 $ 27,027.9 (1) In July 2015, we completed the sale of our Offshore Business, which comprised our Offshore Pipelines & Services business segment. Substantially all of our consolidated revenues are earned in the U.S. and derived from a wide customer base. Our largest non-affiliated customer for 2017 was Vitol Holding B.V. and its affiliates (collectively, “Vitol”), which accounted for 11.2% of our consolidated revenues.

(4) Crude oil prices are based on commercial index prices for WTI as measured on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) and for Louisiana Light Sweet (“LLS”) as reported by Platts. Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices. Energy commodity prices fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including supply and demand imbalances and geopolitical tensions. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.69 per gallon in 2017 versus $0.50 per gallon in 2016 and $0.49 per gallon in 2015. An increase in our consolidated marketing revenues due to higher energy commodity sales prices may not result in an increase in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also be higher due to comparable increases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same relationship would be true in the case of lower energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs. We attempt to mitigate commodity price exposure through our hedging activities and the use of fee-based arrangements. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities. 76 Table of Contents Consolidated Income Statement Highlights The following information highlights significant changes in our comparative income statement amounts and the primary drivers of such changes. Comparison of 2017 with 2016 Revenues Total revenues for 2017 increased $6.22 billion when compared to total revenues for 2016. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, refined products and octane additives increased $3.98 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $2.75 billion increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $1.23 billion increase. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs increased $2.14 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $3.19 billion increase, partially offset by a $1.05 billion decrease due to lower sales volumes. Revenues from midstream services increased a net $94.7 million year-to-year primarily due to the ongoing expansion of our operations. Revenues increased $54.6 million year-to-year from our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal that was placed into service in September 2016. Revenues increased $48.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher deficiency fees on our South Texas crude pipelines. In addition, we received $19.1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds related to the June 2016 fire and associated downtime at our Pascagoula facility. These revenue increases were partially offset by a $27.7 million year-to-year decrease in revenues primarily due to lower firm capacity reservation revenues on the Haynesville Extension pipeline and lower volumes and lower average gathering fees on our Jonah Gathering System. Operating costs and expenses Total operating costs and expenses for 2017 increased $5.91 billion when compared to total operating costs and expenses for 2016. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, refined products and octane additives increased $3.59 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher purchase prices, which accounted for a $2.52 billion increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $1.06 billion increase. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs increased a net $2.19 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher purchase prices, which accounted for a $3.06 billion increase, partially offset by an $873.9 million decrease due to lower sales volumes. Other operating costs and expenses for 2017 increased a net $74.5 million when compared to 2016. Other operating costs and expenses increased primarily due to higher employee compensation, power-related costs, ad valorem tax and maintenance expense, partially offset by $17.4 million of proceeds received in connection with a legal settlement involving our Acadian Gas System in the second quarter of 2017. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses for 2017 increased a net $74.6 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to assets we constructed and placed into service since 2016. Operating costs and expenses also include $49.8 million and $52.8 million of non-cash asset impairment and related charges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our nonrecurring fair value measurements. General and administrative costs General and administrative costs for 2017 increased $21.0 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to higher legal, regulatory and employee compensation costs. General and administrative costs for 2016 include $0.7 million of non-cash asset impairment charges. Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2017 increased a net $64.0 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in earnings from our investments in crude oil pipelines joint ventures. 77 Table of Contents Operating income Operating income for 2017 increased $348.2 million when compared to 2016 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Interest expense Interest expense for 2017 increased $2.0 million when compared to 2016. The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 1,110.4 $ 1,088.9 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization 38.2 30.5 Interest cost capitalized in connection with construction projects (1) (192.1 ) (168.2 ) Other (2) 28.1 31.4 Total $ 984.6 $ 982.6 (1) We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital spending levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. (2) Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is the primary driver of interest expense, increased a net $21.5 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2017, which accounted for a $31.6 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates in 2017, which accounted for a $10.1 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2017 was $24.13 billion compared to $23.41 billion for 2016. In general, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital spending program. For a discussion of our consolidated debt obligations and capital spending program, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Capital Spending” within this Part II, Item 7 of this annual report. Change in fair market value of Liquidity Option Agreement We recognized an increase of $39.8 million of aggregate non-cash expense attributable to accretion and changes in management estimates regarding inputs to the valuation model for the Liquidity Option Agreement. The unfavorable adjustment was primarily due to the effects of the recent federal tax reform measures known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (i.e., limitation of interest expense deductibility, partially offset by a lower federal tax rate). For information regarding the Liquidity Option Agreement, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Income taxes Income taxes primarily reflects our state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (“Texas Margin Tax”). Our provision for income taxes for 2017 increased $2.3 million when compared to 2016. Comparison of 2016 with 2015 Revenues Total revenues for 2016 decreased $4.01 billion when compared to total revenues for 2015. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil decreased $3.93 billion year-to-year due to lower sales volumes and prices, which accounted for a $2.77 billion decrease and a $1.16 billion decrease, respectively. Revenues from the marketing of natural gas, petrochemicals, refined products and octane additives decreased a net $513.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $760.0 million decrease, partially offset by a $246.2 million increase due to higher sales volumes. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs increased a net $335.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $956.2 million increase, partially offset by a $620.5 million decrease due to lower sales prices. 78 Table of Contents Revenues from midstream services increased a net $134.6 million year-to-year primarily due to the ongoing expansion of our operations. Revenues increased $144.5 million year-to-year from the assets we acquired in the EFS Midstream acquisition in July 2015. Revenues from midstream services decreased $76.0 million year-to-year due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015. The remaining $66.1 million year-to-year increase in revenues from midstream services is primarily due to contractual increases in committed volumes on pipeline assets, such as ATEX and the Aegis Ethane Pipeline (“Aegis”), and the expansion of storage capacity at our terminal assets on the Gulf Coast. Operating costs and expenses Total operating costs and expenses for 2016 decreased $4.03 billion when compared to total operating costs and expenses for 2015. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil decreased $3.69 billion year-to-year due to lower sales volumes and prices, which accounted for a $2.53 billion decrease and a $1.16 billion decrease, respectively. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of natural gas, petrochemicals, refined products and octane additives decreased a net $416.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $666.1 million decrease, partially offset by a $250.0 million increase due to higher sales volumes. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs increased a net $206.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $754.2 million increase, partially offset by lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $547.7 million decrease. Other operating costs and expenses decreased a net $23.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower maintenance expenses during 2016 when compared to 2015. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses for 2016 increased a net $28.5 million when compared to 2015. A $112.8 million year-to-year increase primarily due to assets we constructed and placed into service or acquired during 2016 or the later part of 2015 was partially offset by an $84.3 million decrease attributable to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015. Operating costs and expenses also include $52.8 million and $162.6 million of non-cash asset impairment and related charges for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Non-cash asset impairment charges for 2016 primarily relate to the planned abandonment of plant and pipeline assets in Texas and New Mexico. Related charges for 2016 include a $7.1 million non-cash write-off for assets damaged in a fire at our Pascagoula, Mississippi natural gas processing facility in June 2016. In 2015, we recorded a $54.8 million asset impairment charge in connection with our sale of the Offshore Business. The remainder of our non-cash asset impairment charges for 2015 primarily relate to natural gas processing assets in southern Louisiana, certain marine vessels and the abandonment of certain crude oil and natural gas pipeline assets in Texas. General and administrative costs General and administrative costs for 2016 decreased $32.5 million when compared to 2015 primarily due to lower costs for employee compensation and professional services. General and administrative costs for 2016 include $0.7 million of non-cash asset impairment charges. Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2016 decreased a net $11.6 million when compared to 2015. Results for 2015 reflect $46.6 million of equity earnings attributable to the Offshore Business sold in July 2015. This year-to-year decrease was partially offset by a net $30.5 million increase in earnings from our investments in crude oil pipelines, which benefited from the settlement of a rate case by Seaway during 2016. Operating income Operating income for 2016 increased $40.5 million when compared to 2015 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. 79 Table of Contents Interest expense Interest expense for 2016 increased $20.8 million when compared to 2015. The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 1,088.9 $ 1,063.4 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization 30.5 15.4 Interest cost capitalized in connection with construction projects (168.2 ) (149.1 ) Other 31.4 32.1 Total $ 982.6 $ 961.8 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is the primary driver of interest expense, increased a net $25.5 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2016, which accounted for a $54.8 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates in 2016, which accounted for a $29.3 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2016 was $23.41 billion compared to $22.24 billion for 2015. Change in fair market value of Liquidity Option Agreement We recognized a decrease of $0.9 million of aggregate non-cash expense attributable to accretion and changes in management estimates regarding inputs to the valuation model for the Liquidity Option Agreement. Income taxes Income taxes primarily reflects our state tax obligations under the Texas Margin Tax. Our provision for income taxes for 2016 increased $25.9 million when compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in accruals for the Texas Margin Tax. In June 2015, the State of Texas lowered the tax rate under the Texas Margin Tax, which resulted in an income tax benefit for us in 2015. Business Segment Highlights We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The following table presents gross operating margin by segment and non-GAAP total gross operating margin for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Gross operating margin by segment: NGL Pipelines & Services $ 3,258.3 $ 2,990.6 $ 2,771.6 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services 987.2 854.6 961.9 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 714.5 734.9 782.6 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services 714.6 650.6 718.5 Offshore Pipelines & Services -- -- 97.5 Total segment gross operating margin (1) 5,674.6 5,230.7 5,332.1 Net adjustment for shipper make-up rights 5.8 17.1 7.1 Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 5,680.4 $ 5,247.8 $ 5,339.2 (1) Within the context of this table, total segment gross operating margin represents a subtotal and corresponds to measures similarly titled within our business segment disclosures found under Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 80 Table of Contents Total gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Total gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. Segment gross operating margin for NGL Pipelines & Services and Crude Oil Pipelines & Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights that are included in management’s evaluation of segment results. However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total gross operating margin. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income. For a discussion of operating income and its components, see the previous section titled “Consolidated Income Statement Highlights” within this Item 7. The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income to total gross operating margin for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Operating income (GAAP) $ 3,928.9 $ 3,580.7 $ 3,540.2 Adjustments to reconcile operating income to total gross operating margin: Add depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 1,531.3 1,456.7 1,428.2 Add asset impairment and related charges in operating costs and expenses 49.8 52.8 162.6 Add net losses or subtract net gains attributable to asset sales (10.7 ) (2.5 ) 15.6 Add general and administrative costs 181.1 160.1 192.6 Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 5,680.4 $ 5,247.8 $ 5,339.2 Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. The following information highlights significant changes in our year-to-year segment results (i.e., our segment gross operating margin) and the primary drivers of such changes. The volume statistics presented in the tabular information for each segment are reported on a net basis, taking into account our ownership interests in certain joint ventures, and reflect the periods in which we owned an interest in such operations. These statistics reflect volumes for newly constructed assets from the dates such assets were placed into service. Estimated Impact of Hurricane Harvey on Results for 2017 In late August and early September 2017, the Gulf Coast region of Texas, including its critical energy infrastructure, was impacted by the cumulative effects of Hurricane Harvey. Impacts on the energy industry included, but were not limited to, severe flooding and limited access to facilities, disruptions to energy demand from area refineries and petrochemical facilities and the closure of all ports on the Texas Gulf Coast, which limited access to export markets. Although operating at reduced rates, many of our plant, pipeline and storage assets along the Texas Gulf Coast remained operational during the storm. We estimate that Hurricane Harvey reduced our gross operating margin for the third and fourth quarters of 2017 by approximately $35 million and $11 million, respectively. Of this amount, approximately $30 million represents the combined net impact of lower-than-anticipated volumes and lost business opportunities. The remaining $16 million represents expenses we incurred in connection with hurricane-related repair and recovery costs. 81 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the estimated reduction in our total gross operating margin by business segment due to the effects of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 (dollars in millions): Impact on total gross operating margin by segment: Petrochemical & Refined Products Services $ (30.9 ) NGL Pipelines & Services (8.1 ) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services (6.0 ) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services (1.0 ) Total estimated impact due to the effects of Hurricane Harvey $ (46.0 ) As a result of our deductible levels, we do not expect any reimbursement from insurance in connection with property damage or business interruption claims from Hurricane Harvey. NGL Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Segment gross operating margin: Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities $ 911.2 $ 846.6 $ 895.0 NGL pipelines, storage and terminals 1,821.0 1,625.4 1,380.9 NGL fractionation 526.1 518.6 495.7 Total $ 3,258.3 $ 2,990.6 $ 2,771.6 Selected volumetric data: NGL pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 3,168 2,965 2,700 NGL marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 516 436 302 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 831 828 826 Equity NGL production (MBPD) (1) 158 141 133 Fee-based natural gas processing (MMcf/d) (2) 4,572 4,736 4,905 (1) Represents the NGL volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities. (2) Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our natural gas processing plants. Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2017 increased a net $64.6 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants in Louisiana and Mississippi increased a combined $54.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower operating expenses, which accounted for $19.4 million of the increase, and the receipt of $19.1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds in connection with the fire and resulting downtime at our Pascagoula facility in June 2016. The facility was repaired and placed back into commercial service in December 2016. Gross operating margin also increased $9.8 million primarily due to higher average processing margins. Fee-based processing volumes for our Louisiana and Mississippi plants increased a combined 138 MMcf/d year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco natural gas processing plants increased a net $31.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for $41.9 million of the increase, partially offset by lower average processing fees, which accounted for a $7.3 million decrease. On a combined basis for these three plants, fee-based natural gas processing volumes and equity NGL production decreased 61 MMcf/d and increased 16 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities decreased a net $10.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average sales margins, which accounted for a $37.9 million decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $20.1 million increase, and lower operating costs, which accounted for an additional $7.4 million increase. Results from NGL marketing’s activities decreased $11.4 million year-to-year due to non-cash mark-to-market activity. 82 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants in South Texas decreased a net $9.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower fee-based processing volumes, which accounted for a $17.6 million decrease, and higher operating costs of $7.3 million, partially offset by higher average processing margins, which accounted for an $18.0 million increase. Lower producer drilling activity in South Texas contributed to a 352 MMcf/d decrease in fee-based natural gas processing volumes for these plants. Gross operating margin from our South Eddy natural gas processing plant increased $3.9 million year-to-year. Fee-based natural gas processing volumes and equity NGL production for this plant increased 96 MMcf/d and 3 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year. As previously noted, the South Eddy plant commenced operations in May 2016. Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2016 decreased $48.4 million when compared to 2015. Collectively, gross operating margin from our Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco plants decreased $53.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower processing margins, including the impact of our related hedging activities. Gross operating margin from our South Texas plants decreased $49.8 million year-to-year attributable to lower average processing fees and margins, which accounted for a combined $38.1 million decrease, and lower fee-based processing volumes of 227 MMcf/d, which accounted for a $15.8 million decrease. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants in Louisiana and Mississippi decreased a combined $21.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower processing margins, which accounted for a $6.4 million decrease (including the impact of related hedging activities), and higher operating expenses. Operating expenses at these plants increased $12.1 million year-to-year, which includes $10.4 million of costs attributable to a fire that occurred at our Pascagoula facility in June 2016. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased a net $74.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $261.3 million increase, partially offset by a $186.7 million decrease due to lower sales margins. Results from NGL marketing’s export-oriented strategies increased $119.2 million year-to-year, which was partially offset by a $44.6 million net decrease in gross operating margin from NGL marketing’s other strategies. NGL pipelines, storage and terminals Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines, storage and terminal assets for 2017 increased a net $195.6 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from ATEX increased $57.2 million year-to-year primarily due to contractual increases in committed shipper volumes and interruptible shipper volumes. Gross operating margin from our equity investments in the Texas Express Gathering System and the Texas Express Pipeline increased a combined $18.3 million year-to-year primarily due to contractual increases in committed shipper volumes. On a combined basis, NGL transportation volumes for these pipeline systems increased 21 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal and Houston Ship Channel Pipeline System increased a combined $52.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher volumes. Ethane loading volumes at our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal increased 75 MBPD year-to-year. In addition, transportation volumes on our Houston Ship Channel Pipeline System increased 105 MBPD year-to-year primarily due to shipments of ethane from Mont Belvieu to the Morgan’s Point terminal. Gross operating margin from our storage complex in Mont Belvieu for NGLs and related products increased $50.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average fees in 2017. Gross operating margin from our Seminole, Chaparral and affiliated pipelines increased a combined net $23.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average transportation fees, which accounted for a $15.9 million increase, and higher transportation volumes, which accounted for an additional $14.8 million increase, partially offset by higher operating costs of $6.6 million. On a combined basis, NGL transportation volumes on these pipelines increased 33 MBPD primarily due to increased production from natural gas processing plants located in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountains. 83 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our Dixie Pipeline and related terminals increased a $9.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes, which increased 19 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Tri-States NGL Pipeline increased $8.7 million year-to-year primarily due to a 10 MBPD (net to our interest) increase in transportation volumes.

Gross operating margin from Aegis increased $40.7 million year-to-year primarily due to an 84 MBPD increase in transportation volumes. Contracted volume commitments continue to ramp higher through 2018 for ATEX and 2019 for Aegis. The third and final segment of Aegis was completed in December 2015. Gross operating margin from EHT and the Houston Ship Channel Pipeline System increased $99.5 million year-to-year, primarily due to higher marine terminal and pipeline transportation volumes of 122 MBPD and 113 MBPD, respectively. Gross operating margin from our NGL and related product storage complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas increased $26.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher fees. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related terminals increased $10.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower operating expenses. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System increased $9.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation fees, which escalated in January 2016. Gross operating margin from our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, which was placed into commercial service in September 2016, was a loss of $16.2 million primarily due to commissioning costs. NGL fractionation Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2017 increased a net $7.5 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators increased a net $4.1 million primarily due to higher average fractionation fees and blending revenues, which accounted for a $50.8 million increase, partially offset by higher storage, maintenance and power expenses of $47.3 million. NGL fractionation volumes increased 9 MBPD year-to-year, net to our interest. Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2016 increased $22.9 million when compared to 2015 primarily due to higher fractionation revenues at our Mont Belvieu fractionators. Fractionation revenues at Mont Belvieu increased $25.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher fees, which accounted for a $13.2 million increase, and higher fractionation volumes of 10 MBPD, which accounted for an additional $12.4 million increase. 84 Table of Contents Crude Oil Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Segment gross operating margin $ 987.2 $ 854.6 $ 961.9 Selected volumetric data: Crude oil pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 1,820 1,388 1,474 Crude oil marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 531 495 557 Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from our Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for 2017 increased a net $132.6 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from our Midland-to-ECHO Pipeline System was $63.3 million for 2017 on transportation volumes of 333 MBPD. This system commenced limited operations in November 2017. Gross operating margin from our West Texas System and equity investment in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System increased a combined $54.7 million year-to-year primarily due to an 89 MBPD increase in crude oil transportation volumes (net to our interest) from the Permian Basin. Gross operating margin from our EFS Midstream System increased $31.7 million year-to-year primarily due to increased deficiency fee revenues. Condensate transportation volumes for this system decreased 18 MBPD year-to-year and associated natural gas volumes decreased 101 MMcf/d year-to-year. Gross operating margin for the system decreased $59.7 million year-to-year primarily due to the lower throughput volumes; however, this decrease was more than offset by a $98.1 million year-to-year increase in deficiency fee revenues associated with producer volume commitments. Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System increased $25.0 million primarily due to higher firm capacity reservation fees associated with the Midland-to-ECHO Pipeline System, which accounted for a $17.1 million increase, and increased blending revenues, which accounted for an additional $11.5 million increase. Crude oil transportation volumes decreased 9 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from crude oil marketing and related activities decreased a net $43.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average sales margins, which accounted for a $94.7 million decrease, partially offset by a $35.6 million benefit related to non-cash mark-to-market results, lower pipeline-related costs, which accounted for a $7.8 million increase, and higher earnings from trucking activities, which accounted for an additional $7.5 million increase. Non-cash mark-to-market earnings for this business was a loss of $4.8 million for 2017 versus a loss of $40.4 million for 2016. Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from our Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for 2016 decreased $107.3 million when compared to 2015. Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related activities decreased $187.5 million year-to-year primarily due to lower crude oil sales margins, which accounted for a $147.1 million decrease, and $40.4 million of net non-cash mark-to-market losses recognized in 2016 on financial instruments related to blending activities. As a result of lower crude oil prices, regional price spreads have been less than the transportation costs incurred by our marketing business, particularly on its 75 MBPD of firm capacity on the Seaway Pipeline (25 MBPD of this capacity terminated in June 2017). 85 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System decreased $95.0 million year-to-year primarily due to a 74 MBPD decrease in volumes, which accounted for a $66.6 million decrease, and a $32.4 million decrease due to lower average transportation fees. The decrease in crude oil transportation volumes is attributable to reduced producer drilling activity in the Eagle Ford Shale. Gross operating margin from our EFS Midstream system, which we acquired effective July 1, 2015, increased $127.9 million year-to-year due to the timing of the acquisition of these assets. Gross operating margin for this system reflects twelve months of ownership in 2016 versus six months in 2015. Gross operating margin from crude oil terminaling services at our Beaumont Marine West and ECHO terminals increased a combined $33.9 million year-to-year primarily due to expansion projects. Gross operating margin from our investment in Seaway for 2016 increased $14.2 million when compared to 2015 primarily due to the settlement of a rate case with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) in the first quarter of 2016. In February 2016, the FERC issued its decision regarding the various challenges to Seaway’s committed and uncommitted rates in FERC Docket No. IS12-226-000. The FERC upheld the committed rates and rejected the claim that the committed rates should be reduced to cost-based levels. The FERC’s rulings regarding the uncommitted rates were also largely favorable to Seaway. Seaway submitted a compliance filing in March 2016 calculating revised uncommitted rates consistent with the FERC’s order. The compliance filing was not challenged and the FERC accepted the revised rates. On a 100% basis, Seaway recorded a $24.5 million benefit related to settlement of the rate case, with our 50% share of the benefit equating to $12.3 million.

Gross operating margin from our Permian Basin Gathering System increased $10.5 million year-to-year primarily due to a 60 BBtus/d increase in natural gas gathering volumes on the Carlsbad Pipeline, which accounted for a $7.0 million increase, and higher condensate sales revenues, which accounted for an additional $2.4 million increase. Natural gas production in the Permian Basin has increased in connection with a significant rise in crude oil production across West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. Gross operating margin from the East Texas natural gas pipeline assets we acquired from Azure in April 2017 was $9.0 million on gathering volumes of 220 BBtus/d. 86 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our Acadian Gas System increased a net $7.1 million year-to-year primarily due to $17.4 million of proceeds received in a legal settlement in the second quarter of 2017 for lost revenues and damages associated with the Bayou Corne sinkhole incident caused by third parties in 2012, partially offset by lower firm capacity reservation revenues on the Haynesville Extension pipeline, which accounted for a $6.4 million year-to-year decrease, and lower average gathering fees, which accounted for an additional $1.8 million decrease. Gross operating margin from our Haynesville Gathering System increased a net $8.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher gathering volumes, which accounted for an $11.7 million increase, partially offset by the effects of lower average gathering fees, which accounted for a $2.8 million decrease. Transportation volumes for the Haynesville Extension pipeline, which is a component of the Acadian Gas System, increased 308 BBtus/d and volumes for the Haynesville Gathering System increased 213 BBtus/d. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities increased a net $8.8 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in average sales margins, which accounted for a $7.9 million increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $4.8 million increase, partially offset by non-cash mark-to-market losses, which accounted for a $3.9 million decrease. Non-cash mark-to-market earnings for this business was a loss of $7.9 million in 2017 versus a loss of $4.0 million in 2016. Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for 2016 decreased $47.7 million when compared to 2015. Gross operating margin from our Acadian Gas System decreased $18.8 million year-to-year primarily due to reduced transportation fees. Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System decreased $16.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower revenues attributable to decreased producer drilling activity in the Eagle Ford Shale and Barnett Shale. Transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System decreased 149 BBtus/d year-to-year. Collectively, gross operating margin for 2016 from our San Juan, Jonah, Piceance Basin and Fairplay Gathering Systems decreased $18.4 million when compared to 2015, the primarily driver of which is a combined 363 BBtus/d decrease in gathering volumes. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities decreased a net $2.8 million year-to-year primarily due to mark-to-market losses recorded in 2016 on financial instruments related to commodity hedging. Gross operating margin from our Carlsbad Gathering System in West Texas and New Mexico increased $13.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher gathering volumes of 97 BBtus/d.

Gross operating margin from propylene production and related marketing activities for 2017 increased a net $10.3 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu propylene fractionation plants increased a net $33.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher propylene average sales margins and volumes, which accounted for a $43.5 million increase, and higher average propylene fractionation fees, which accounted for an additional $13.8 million increase, partially offset by an increase in maintenance, storage and other operating costs of $23.9 million. Gross operating margin from the PDH facility decreased $13.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher commissioning costs. We expect the PDH facility to enter full service during the first quarter of 2018. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu rail terminal decreased $2.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower loading volumes of 4 MBPD. Gross operating margin from our propylene export marine terminals decreased a net $1.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average loading fees, which accounted for a $7.3 million decrease, partially offset by lower operating costs, which accounted for a $4.3 million increase. Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from propylene fractionation and related activities for 2016 increased $22.6 million when compared to 2015. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu propylene fractionation plants increased a net $37.1 million year-to-year. When compared to results for 2015, these plants benefitted in 2016 from $29.6 million of lower operating costs, $16.6 million of higher propylene fractionation and other fee revenues, and a $13.1 million increase in gross operating margin attributable to higher propylene fractionation volumes of 3 MBPD. The year-to-year decrease in operating costs is attributable to major maintenance projects that were completed in 2015. Partially offsetting these benefits was a $22.2 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin attributable to lower propylene sales margins. Pre-commissioning expenses associated with our PDH facility increased $15.5 million during 2016 when compared to 2015. Butane isomerization and related operations Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization and deisobutanizer (“DIB”) operations for 2017 increased $20.3 million when compared to 2016. Operating expenses associated with our isomerization facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas decreased $15.5 million year-to-year primarily due to major maintenance activities completed during 2016. By-product sales revenues increased a net $7.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales prices, which accounted for a $21.7 million increase, offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $14.5 million decrease. Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization and DIB operations for 2016 decreased a net $13.2 million when compared to 2015. Operating expenses associated with our isomerization facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas increased $22.4 million year-to-year primarily due to major maintenance activities we completed during 2016. Butane processing revenues increased $7.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher butane isomerization and standalone DIB processing volumes of 12 MBPD and 10 MBPD, respectively. Octane enhancement and related plant operations Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement facility and high purity isobutylene (“HPIB”) plant for 2017 increased $80.4 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement facility increased $80.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower major maintenance costs, which accounted for $42.6 million of the increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $30.5 million increase. 88 Table of Contents Historically, our octane enhancement plant experienced downtime annually for major maintenance activities. During 2016, we completed modifications to our octane enhancement plant to alleviate the need for such yearly outages. We now expect downtime for major maintenance activities at our octane enhancement plant once every three years. As a result of these modifications, plant production volumes increased 4 MBPD year-to-year. Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement facility and HPIB plant for 2016 decreased $102.1 million when compared to 2015. This year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin is primarily due to lower sales margins, including the results of our related hedging activities. Refined products pipelines and related activities Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2017 decreased a net $25.5 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from refined products marketing decreased a net $18.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average refined products sales margins, which accounted for a $30.0 million decrease, partially offset by a $12.0 million year-to-year increase in non-cash mark-to-market income. Non-cash mark-to-market earnings for this business was a gain of $2.4 million in 2017 versus a loss of $9.6 million in 2016. Gross operating margin from our Beaumont and Houston Ship Channel refined products marine terminals decreased a combined $14.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating costs. Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline increased a net $7.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average transportation fees, which accounted for a $10.8 million increase, partially offset by lower transportation volumes, which accounted for a $5.8 million decrease. Transportation volumes for the TE Products Pipeline decreased 24 MBPD primarily due to lower refined products and petrochemical product movements during 2017. Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2016 increased $46.8 million when compared to 2015. Gross operating margin from our Beaumont refined products terminals increased $24.9 million year-to-year primarily due to expansions and higher demand for storage and marine vessel loading services. Gross operating margin for the TE Products Pipeline and related terminals increased $20.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher volumes. Interstate refined products pipeline transportation volumes on our TE Products Pipeline increased 10 MBPD year-to-year. Intrastate refined products and petrochemical pipeline transportation volumes on our TE Products Pipeline increased a combined 40 MBPD year-to-year. Marine transportation and other Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other activities for 2017 decreased $21.5 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin attributable to our marine transportation business decreased $18.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average fees. Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other activities for 2016 decreased $22.0 million when compared to 2015 primarily due to lower demand for marine transportation services attributable to the lower commodity pricing environment. Offshore Pipelines & Services We sold our Offshore Business in July 2015. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data through the closing date of the sale, July 24, 2015 (dollars in millions, volumes as noted). Segment gross operating margin $ 97.5 Selected volumetric data: Natural gas transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 587 Crude oil transportation volumes (MBPD) 357 Platform natural gas processing (MMcf/d) 101 Platform crude oil processing (MBPD) 13 89 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. At December 31, 2017, we had $3.75 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $3.74 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $5.1 million of unrestricted cash on hand. In February 2018, we issued $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and junior subordinated notes and used the net proceeds therefrom for the temporary repayment of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and for the expected redemption of all $682.7 million aggregate principal amount of our Junior Subordinated Notes B. For information regarding these debt offerings and the related redemption, see “Significant Recent Developments” within this Item 7. We expect to issue additional equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital spending. Consolidated Debt The following table presents scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2017 for the years indicated (dollars in millions): Scheduled Maturities of Debt Total 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Commercial Paper Notes $ 1,755.7 $ 1,755.7 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- Senior Notes 19,850.0 1,100.0 1,500.0 1,500.0 575.0 650.0 14,525.0 Junior Subordinated Notes 3,174.4 -- -- -- -- -- 3,174.4 Total $ 24,780.1 $ 2,855.7 $ 1,500.0 $ 1,500.0 $ 575.0 $ 650.0 $ 17,699.4 The following information describes significant transactions that affected our consolidated debt obligations during the year ended December 31, 2017: Issuance of $1.7 Billion of Junior Subordinated Notes in August 2017 In August 2017, EPO issued a combined $1.7 billion in principal amount of junior subordinated notes in two series. The EPO Junior Subordinated Notes D (“Junior Notes D”), which were issued at $700 million principal amount in the aggregate, are redeemable at EPO’s option, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, on or after August 16, 2022 (the non-call 5 notes) at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Junior Notes D bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.875% per year through August 15, 2022. Beginning August 16, 2022, Junior Notes D will bear interest at a floating rate based on a three-month LIBOR rate plus 2.986%, reset quarterly. Junior Notes D mature in August 2077. The EPO Junior Subordinated Notes E (“Junior Notes E”), which were issued at $1.0 billion principal amount in the aggregate, are redeemable at EPO’s option, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, on or after August 16, 2027 (the non-call 10 notes) at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Junior Notes E bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% per year through August 15, 2027. Beginning August 16, 2027, Junior Notes E will bear interest at a floating rate based on a three-month LIBOR rate plus 3.033%, reset quarterly. Junior Notes E also mature in August 2077. Net proceeds from the issuance of Junior Notes D and E were used for (i) the temporary repayment of approximately $900 million of amounts then outstanding under EPO’s commercial paper program and (ii) the repayment of $800 million in principal amount of Senior Notes L that matured in September 2017. 90 Table of Contents EPO’s payment obligations under Junior Notes D and E are subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of its current and future senior indebtedness (as defined in the indenture governing such notes). Enterprise Products Partners L.P. guarantees repayment of amounts due under Junior Notes D and E on an unsecured and junior subordinated basis. The indenture governing these notes allows EPO to defer interest payments on one or more occasions for up to ten consecutive years subject to certain conditions. Subject to certain exceptions, during any period in which interest payments are deferred, neither we nor EPO can declare or pay any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, any of our respective equity securities or make any payments on, or repay, repurchase or redeem, any of our respective debt securities that rank equally with or are subordinate to EPO’s junior subordinated notes (or any related guarantee, as applicable). Each series of EPO’s junior subordinated notes ranks equally with each other. 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement In September 2017, EPO entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement that replaced its prior 364-day credit facility. The new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures in September 2018. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement. Under the terms of the new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $1.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $200 million to $1.7 billion at EPO’s election, provided certain conditions are met) at a variable interest rate for a term of 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. To the extent that principal amounts are outstanding at the maturity date, EPO may elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as a non-revolving term loan for a period of one additional year, payable in September 2019. Borrowings under this revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general company purposes. The 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants (affirmative and negative) and events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity date of any amounts borrowed under this credit agreement. The credit agreement also restricts EPO’s ability to pay cash distributions to its parent, Enterprise Products Partners L.P., if an event of default (as defined in the credit agreement) has occurred and is continuing at the time such distribution is scheduled to be paid or would result therefrom. EPO’s obligations under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement are not secured by any collateral; however, they are guaranteed by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility In September 2017, EPO entered into a revolving credit agreement that matures in September 2022 (the “Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility”). This new facility replaced EPO’s prior multi-year revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in September 2020. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under the new credit facility. Under the terms of the new Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility, EPO may borrow up to $4.0 billion (which may be increased by up to $500 million to $4.5 billion at EPO’s election, provided certain conditions are met) at a variable interest rate for a term of five years, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. Borrowings under this revolving credit facility may be used as a backstop for commercial paper and for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general company purposes. The Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties, covenants (affirmative and negative) and events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity date of any amounts borrowed under this credit facility. The credit facility also restricts EPO’s ability to pay cash distributions to its parent, Enterprise Products Partners L.P., if an event of default (as defined in the credit facility) has occurred and is continuing at the time such distribution is scheduled to be paid or would result therefrom. EPO’s obligations under the Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility are not secured by any collateral; however, they are guaranteed by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. 91 Table of Contents Issuance of Common Units The following table summarizes the issuance of common units in connection with our at-the-market (“ATM”) program, DRIP and employee unit purchase plan (“EUPP”) for the periods indicated (dollars in millions, number of units issued as shown): Number of Common Units Issued Net Cash Proceeds Received Year Ended December 31, 2015: Common units issued in connection with ATM program 25,520,424 $ 817.4 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 12,793,913 371.2 Total 38,314,337 $ 1,188.6 Year Ended December 31, 2016: Common units issued in connection with ATM program 87,867,037 $ 2,156.1 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 16,316,534 386.7 Total 104,183,571 $ 2,542.8 Year Ended December 31, 2017: Common units issued in connection with ATM program 21,807,726 $ 597.0 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 19,046,019 476.4 Total 40,853,745 $ 1,073.4 Universal shelf registration statement We have a universal shelf registration statement (the “2016 Shelf”) on file with the SEC which allows Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and EPO (each on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. ATM Program In November 2017, we filed an amended registration statement with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $2.54 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings in connection with our ATM program. Pursuant to this program, we may sell common units under an equity distribution agreement between Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and certain broker-dealers from time-to-time by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on November 20, 2017 and replaced our prior registration statement with respect to the ATM program. Following the effectiveness of the new registration statement and after taking into account the aggregate sales price of common units sold under the ATM program through December 31, 2017, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under the ATM program up to an aggregate sales price of $2.54 billion. DRIP and EUPP We have a registration statement on file with the SEC in connection with our DRIP. The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional new common units. After taking into account the number of common units issued under the DRIP through December 31, 2017, we have the capacity to issue an additional 80,717,140 common units under this plan. Affiliates of EPCO purchased $100 million of our common units through the DRIP in connection with the distribution paid on February 7, 2018. In addition to the DRIP, we have registration statements on file with the SEC in connection with our EUPP. After taking into account the number of common units issued under the EUPP through December 31, 2017, we had the capacity to issue an additional 5,760,811 common units under this plan. Use of Proceeds The net cash proceeds we received from the issuance of common units during 2017 were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under EPO’s commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities and for general partnership purposes. 92 Table of Contents For additional information regarding our issuance of common units and related registration statements, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Restricted Cash Restricted cash represents amounts held in segregated bank accounts by our clearing brokers as margin in support of our commodity derivative instruments portfolio and related physical purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and refined products. Additional cash may be restricted to maintain our commodity derivative instruments portfolio as prices fluctuate or margin requirements change. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our restricted cash amounts were $65.2 million and $354.5 million, respectively. The balance of restricted cash decreased since December 31, 2016 primarily due to the settlement of derivative instruments related to contango positions during 2017. For information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Credit Ratings As of February 1, 2018, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s, Baa1 from Moody’s and BBB+ from Fitch Ratings. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO’s short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor’s, P-2 from Moody’s and F-2 from Fitch Ratings. EPO’s credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 4,666.3 $ 4,066.8 $ 4,002.4 Cash used in investing activities 3,286.1 4,005.8 3,425.9 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,727.5 ) 321.7 (616.0 ) Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. We operate in the midstream energy industry, which includes gathering, transporting, processing, fractionating and storing natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemical and refined products. As such, changes in the prices of hydrocarbon products and in the relative price levels among hydrocarbon products could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in prices may impact demand for hydrocarbon products, which in turn may impact production, demand and the volumes of products for which we provide services. In addition, decreases in demand may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels. We may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their obligations to us in connection with our marketing of natural gas, NGLs, propylene, refined products and/or crude oil and long-term take-or-pay agreements. 93 Table of Contents Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a major consideration in our businesses, and our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to sufficiently eliminate customer credit risk. Further, adverse economic conditions in our industry, such as those experienced throughout 2015 and 2016, increase the risk of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers, particularly customers that have sub-investment grade credit ratings or small-scale companies. Such non-performance risk could be associated with long-term contracts with minimum volume commitments or fixed demand charges. We manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions may utilize letters of credit, prepayments, net out agreements and guarantees. However, these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk. Our primary markets are located in the Gulf Coast, Southwest, Rocky Mountain, Northeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. We have a concentration of trade receivable balances due from independent and major integrated oil and gas companies and other pipelines and wholesalers. These concentrations may affect our overall credit risk in that these energy industry customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts: Comparison of 2017 with 2016 Operating activities. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $599.5 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: § a $333.2 million increase in cash resulting from higher partnership earnings in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 (after adjusting our $302.6 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); § a $213.1 million year-to-year increase in cash primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations; and § a $53.2 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to our investments in crude oil pipeline joint ventures. For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see “Results of Operations” within this Part II, Item 7. Investing activities. Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $719.7 million when compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to: § an $801.3 million year-to-year decrease in cash used for business combinations, net of cash received. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used for business combinations was $198.7 million, which was primarily related to the Azure acquisition. During the same period in 2016, $1.0 billion was paid for the second and final installment for the acquisition of EFS Midstream; and § an $88.3 million year-to-year decrease in investments in unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to the completion of construction of certain NGL and crude oil joint venture projects; partially offset by § a $117.7 million year-to-year increase in capital spending for consolidated property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs (see “Capital Spending” within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information regarding our capital spending program). 94 Table of Contents Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.73 billion compared to cash provided by financing activities of $321.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $2.05 billion year-to-year change in cash flow from financing activities was primarily due to: § a $1.47 billion year-to-year decrease in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units. We issued an aggregate 40,853,745 common units, which generated $1.07 billion of net cash proceeds, in connection with our ATM program, DRIP and EUPP during the year ended December 31, 2017. This compares to an aggregate 104,183,571 common units we issued in connection with these programs and plans during the same period in 2016, which collectively generated $2.54 billion of net cash proceeds; § a $285.6 million year-to-year decrease in net cash inflows attributable to our consolidated debt obligations. EPO issued $1.7 billion in principal amount of junior subordinated notes and repaid $800.0 million in principal amount of senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the issuance of $1.25 billion and repayment of $750.0 million in principal amount of senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, net repayments under EPO’s commercial paper program were $44.2 million during 2017 compared to net issuances of $647.9 million during 2016; and § a $269.4 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in cash distributions is due to increases in both the number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the quarterly cash distribution rates per unit. Comparison of 2016 with 2015 Operating Activities Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $64.4 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $142.4 million year-to-year increase in cash primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations partially offset by an $81.6 million year-to-year decrease in cash distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015. For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see “Results of Operations” within this Part II, Item 7. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $579.9 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to: § a $1.56 billion year-to-year decrease in cash proceeds from asset sales primarily due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015, which generated proceeds of $1.53 billion; and § an $827.5 million year-to-year decrease in capital spending for consolidated property, plant and equipment; § an $80.3 million year-to-year decrease in aggregate cash used for business combinations and investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates; and § $71.0 million of distributions received in connection with the return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates during 2016. 95 Table of Contents Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $321.7 million compared to cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $616.0 million. The $937.7 million year-to-year change in cash flow from financing activities was primarily due to: § a $1.35 billion year-to-year increase in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units. We issued an aggregate 104,183,571 common units in connection with our ATM program, DRIP and EUPP during 2016, which generated $2.54 billion of net cash proceeds. This compares to an aggregate 38,314,337 common units we issued in connection with these programs and plans during 2015, which collectively generated $1.19 billion of net cash proceeds; partially offset by § a $356.8 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners during 2016 when compared to 2015. The increase in cash distributions is due to increases in both the number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the quarterly cash distribution rates per unit; and § a $72.6 million year-to-year decrease in net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements. EPO issued $1.25 billion and repaid $750.0 billion in principal amount of senior notes during 2016, compared to the issuance of $2.5 billion and repayment of $1.48 billion in principal amount of senior and junior notes during 2015. Net proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program were $647.9 million during 2016 compared to $202.2 million during 2015. Cash Distributions to Limited Partners Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business including, for example, those for capital expenditures, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, commitments and contingencies and other significant amounts. The retention of cash by the partnership allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets. In January 2018, the Board declared a cash distribution of $0.4250 per common unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, our management announced plans in October 2017 to recommend to the Board additional quarterly cash distribution increases of $0.0025 per unit with respect to each of the four quarters of 2018. For additional information regarding our expected distribution growth rate, see “Significant Recent Developments” within this Item 7. We measure available cash by reference to “distributable cash flow,” which is a non-GAAP liquidity measure. Distributable cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly cash distributions. Distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Our management compares the distributable cash flow we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. Based on the level of available cash, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board of Enterprise GP, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Unlike several other master limited partnerships, our general partner has a non-economic ownership interest in us and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from us based on incentive distribution rights or other equity interests. Our use of distributable cash flow for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. For a discussion of net cash flows provided by operating activities, see the previous section titled “Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities” within this Item 7. 96 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our calculation of distributable cash flow for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Net income attributable to limited partners (1) $ 2,799.3 $ 2,513.1 $ 2,521.2 Adjustments to GAAP net income attributable to limited partners to derive non-GAAP distributable cash flow: Add depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 1,644.0 1,552.0 1,516.0 Add non-cash asset impairment and related charges 49.8 53.5 162.6 Add losses or subtract gains attributable to asset sales (10.7 ) (2.5 ) 15.6 Add cash proceeds from asset sales (2) 40.1 46.5 1,608.6 Add changes in fair value of Liquidity Option Agreement (3) 64.3 24.5 25.4 Add or subtract changes in fair market value of derivative instruments 22.8 45.0 (18.4 ) Add cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates (4) 483.0 451.5 462.1 Subtract equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates (426.0 ) (362.0 ) (373.6 ) Subtract sustaining capital expenditures (5) (243.9 ) (252.0 ) (272.6 ) Add gains from monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges (6) 30.6 6.1 -- Add deferred income tax expense or subtract benefit, as applicable 6.1 6.6 (20.6 ) Other, net 42.9 20.5 (19.0 ) Distributable cash flow $ 4,502.3 $ 4,102.8 $ 5,607.3 Total cash distributions paid to limited partners with respect to period $ 3,635.2 $ 3,394.0 $ 3,036.8 Cash distributions per unit declared by Enterprise GP with respect to period (7) $ 1.6825 $ 1.6100 $ 1.5300 Total distributable cash flow retained by partnership with respect to period (8) $ 867.1 $ 708.8 $ 2,570.5 Distribution coverage ratio (9) 1.24x 1.21x 1.85x (1) For a discussion of significant changes in our comparative income statement amounts underlying net income attributable to limited partners, along with the primary drivers of such changes, see “Consolidated Income Statements Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. (2) For a discussion of significant changes in cash proceeds from asset sales as presented in the investing activities section of our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows, see “Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities” within this Part II, Item 7. (3) For information regarding the Liquidity Option Agreement, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (4) Reflects both distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates and those attributable to a return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates. For information regarding our unconsolidated affiliates, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (5) Sustaining capital expenditures include cash payments and accruals applicable to the period.

(7) See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to the periods presented. (8) At the sole discretion of Enterprise GP, cash retained by the partnership with respect to each of these years was primarily reinvested in our growth capital spending program, which substantially reduced our reliance on the equity and debt capital markets to fund such major expenditures. (9) Distribution coverage ratio is determined by dividing distributable cash flow by total cash distributions paid to limited partners and in connection with distribution equivalent rights with respect to the period. 97 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by operating activities to non-GAAP distributable cash flow for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 4,666.3 $ 4,066.8 $ 4,002.4 Adjustments to reconcile net cash flows provided by operating activities to distributable cash flow: Subtract sustaining capital expenditures (243.9 ) (252.0 ) (272.6 ) Add cash proceeds from asset sales 40.1 46.5 1,608.6 Add gains from monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges 30.6 6.1 -- Net effect of changes in operating accounts (32.2 ) 180.9 323.3 Other, net 41.4 54.5 (54.4 ) Distributable cash flow $ 4,502.3 $ 4,102.8 $ 5,607.3 Designated Units Issued in Connection with Holdings Merger In November 2010, we completed our merger with Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. (the “Holdings Merger”). In connection with the Holdings Merger, a privately held affiliate of EPCO agreed to temporarily waive the regular cash distributions it would otherwise receive from us with respect to a certain number of our common units it owns (the “Designated Units”). Distributions paid by us to this privately held affiliate of EPCO during 2015 excluded 35,380,000 Designated Units. The temporary distribution waiver expired in November 2015; therefore, distributions paid to partners during calendar years 2016 and 2017 were on all outstanding common units. Capital Spending An important part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to expand our network of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production resulting from development activities in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, Northeast and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, including the Niobrara, Barnett, Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville, Marcellus and Utica Shale plays. Although our focus in recent years has been on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, asset acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. We placed approximately $4.5 billion of major growth capital projects into service or commissioning during 2017, including our PDH facility, our Midland-to-ECHO Pipeline System (limited service) and expansions related to our propylene pipeline system and Beaumont refined products terminal. We have approximately $5.5 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2020 including our ninth NGL fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Texas (second quarter of 2018), the completion of joint venture-owned dock infrastructure in Corpus Christi designed to accommodate crude oil volumes (third quarter of 2018), the Shin Oak NGL pipeline (second quarter of 2019), our iBDH facility (fourth quarter of 2019) and the ethylene export terminal (first quarter of 2020). Based on information currently available, we expect our total capital spending for 2018 to approximate $3.3 billion, which includes approximately $315 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our forecast of capital spending for 2018 is based on our announced strategic operating and growth plans (through the filing date of this annual report), which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital spending due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather related issues and changes in supplier prices. Furthermore, our forecast of capital spending may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include unforeseen acquisition opportunities. 98 Table of Contents Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a significant factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we expect to make the forecast capital expenditures noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions. The following table summarizes the primary elements of our capital spending for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment: (1) Growth capital projects (2) $ 2,868.8 $ 2,722.7 $ 3,540.0 Sustaining capital projects (3) 233.0 261.4 271.6 Total $ 3,101.8 $ 2,984.1 $ 3,811.6 Business combinations: Cash used for business combinations (4) $ 198.7 $ 1,000.0 $ 1,056.5 Non-cash equity consideration (5) -- -- 1,408.7 Total $ 198.7 $ 1,000.0 $ 2,465.2 Investments in unconsolidated affiliates $ 50.5 $ 138.8 $ 162.6 (1) Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented on a cash basis. (2) Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. (4) Amount for 2017 primarily represents net cash used for the Azure acquisition in April 2017. Amounts for 2016 and 2015 represent the first and second payments for EFS Midstream. We acquired EFS Midstream in July 2015 for approximately $2.1 billion in cash, which was payable in two installments. (5) Amount presented for 2015 relates to the acquisition of noncontrolling interests in step two of the Oiltanking acquisition. Fluctuations in our spending for growth capital projects and investments in unconsolidated affiliates are explained in large part by increases or decreases in spending on major expansion projects. Our most significant growth capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 involved projects at our Mont Belvieu complex as well as projects to support crude oil, natural gas and NGL production from the Permian Basin. Fluctuations in spending for sustaining capital projects are explained in large part by the timing and cost of pipeline integrity and similar projects. Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Growth capital spending for projects to support Permian Basin production increased $909.5 million year-to-year primarily due to increased capital spending for the Midland-to-ECHO Pipeline System, which accounted for $480.2 million of the increase, construction of our Orla I and Orla II plants and related pipelines, which accounted for an additional $422.1 million of the increase, partially offset by decreased capital spending on our South Eddy plant and related pipelines, which accounted for $131.2 million of the decrease. We placed the Midland-to-ECHO Pipeline System into limited commercial service in November 2017. Additionally, we completed construction and placed the South Eddy facility into service in May 2016. Growth capital spending for our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal and our LPG export expansion project decreased a combined $299.3 million. Our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, which has an aggregate loading rate (nameplate capacity) of approximately 10,000 barrels per hour of fully refrigerated ethane and is the largest of its kind in the world, was placed into service in September 2016. Growth capital spending for projects at our Mont Belvieu complex decreased $271.9 million year-to-year, primarily due to decreased capital spending at our PDH facility, which accounted for a $443.8 million decrease, partially offset by increased capital spending on our ninth NGL fractionator, which accounted for a $141.9 million increase, and our iBDH unit, which accounted for a $93.2 million additional increase. 99 Table of Contents Growth capital spending at our ECHO and Beaumont Marine West Crude Oil terminals decreased a combined $103.7 million year-to-year as new storage tanks and related assets were placed into service at these facilities during 2016. Net cash used for business combinations decreased $801.3 million year-to-year due to the second payment of $1.0 billion made in July 2016 for EFS Midstream, partially offset by $191.4 million in net cash paid in connection with the Azure acquisition made in April 2017. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates decreased $88.3 million year-to-year primarily due to the completion of construction of certain NGL and crude oil joint venture projects. Comparison of 2016 with 2015. Growth capital spending for LPG export expansion projects at EHT and our ethane export facility decreased a combined $328.9 million year-to-year. We completed two expansion projects during 2015 at our EHT facility that increased our ability to load cargos of fully refrigerated, low-ethane propane to approximately 16.0 MMBbls per month. Likewise, growth capital spending on our ethane header system between Corpus Christi, Texas and the Mississippi River in Louisiana decreased $288.1 million year-to-year. We completed the Aegis Ethane Pipeline (i.e., the largest component of our ethane header system) in December 2015. Growth capital spending at our ECHO and Beaumont Marine West Crude Oil terminals decreased a combined $146.1 million year-to-year as new storage tanks and related assets were placed into service at these facilities during 2015 and 2016. Growth capital spending for our Rancho II crude oil pipeline, which is a component of our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System, and Midland-to-ECHO Pipeline System decreased a net $95.0 million year-to-year. We completed the Rancho II pipeline in September 2015. Growth capital spending at our Mont Belvieu complex increased $67.1 million year-to-year primarily due to construction of our PDH facility. We acquired EFS Midstream in July 2015 for approximately $2.1 billion in cash, which was payable in two installments. The initial payment of $1.1 billion was paid at closing in July 2015. The second and final installment of $1.0 billion was paid in July 2016 using a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program. Also, in February 2015, we issued 36,827,517 common units valued at approximately $1.4 billion to complete Step 2 of the Oiltanking acquisition. For information regarding these acquisitions, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8, of this annual report. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates decreased $23.8 million year-to-year primarily due to the completion of expansion projects on our Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System during 2015. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following sections discuss the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies: 100 Table of Contents Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Our estimate of depreciation expense incorporates management assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected residual values or (iv) significant changes in our forecast of the remaining life for the applicable resource basins, if any. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $35.62 billion and $33.29 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.3 billion, $1.22 billion and $1.16 billion of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals or refined products. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated residual values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset’s estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes. An equity method investment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible permanent loss in value of the investment (i.e., other than a temporary decline). Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee’s industry. When evidence of a loss in value has occurred, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment’s underlying assets. A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any write-down of the carrying values of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $37.8 million, $45.2 million and $162.6 million, respectively, which are a component of costs and expenses. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 101 Table of Contents Amortization Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. The method used to value such assets depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns the asset is expected to generate. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to certain relationships acquired in connection with business combinations and asset purchases whereby (i) we acquired information about or access to customers and now have the ability to provide services to them and (ii) the customers now have the ability to make direct contact with us. Customer relationships may arise from contractual arrangements (such as service contracts) and through means other than contracts, such as through regular contact by sales or service representatives. The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization periods for certain of our customer relationship intangible assets are limited by the estimated finite economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basins. In this context, our estimate of the useful life of each resource basin is predicated on a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. Contract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement and the Jonah natural gas gathering contracts. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a fractionation facility, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements. If our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset’s unamortized cost is not recoverable due to impairment, we would be required to reduce the asset’s carrying value to its estimated fair value through the recording of a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was $3.69 billion and $3.86 billion, respectively. We recorded $166.9 million, $171.3 million and $174.1 million of amortization expense attributable to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is subject to annual impairment testing at the end of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is probable that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Goodwill impairment testing involves determining the fair value of the associated reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the businesses that make up the reporting unit. Such assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the associated businesses, which, in turn, rely on management’s estimates of operating margins, throughput volumes and similar inputs; (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond discrete forecast periods; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of a reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a non-cash impairment charge to operating costs and expenses is required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of our goodwill was $5.75 billion. 102 Table of Contents We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2017, 2016 or 2015. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment test at December 31, 2017, each reporting unit’s fair value was substantially in excess of its carrying value (i.e., by at least 10%). For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses Our use of estimates for certain revenues and expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of our use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for a specific period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. If the assumptions underlying our revenue and expense estimates prove to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. We review our estimates based on currently available information. For information regarding our revenue recognition policies, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 103 Table of Contents Other Items Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 (dollars in millions): Payment or Settlement due by Period In less than In 1-3 In 4-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1) $ 24,780.1 $ 2,855.7 $ 3,000.0 $ 1,225.0 $ 17,699.4 Estimated cash payments for interest (2) $ 23,942.0 $ 1,082.9 $ 1,986.3 $ 1,796.8 $ 19,076.0 Operating lease obligations (3) $ 413.3 $ 57.0 $ 100.0 $ 71.3 $ 185.0 Purchase obligations: (4) Product purchase commitments: Estimated payment obligations: Natural gas $ 1,911.5 $ 615.1 $ 963.5 $ 332.9 $ -- NGLs $ 99.0 $ 69.6 $ 29.4 $ -- $ -- Crude oil $ 7,891.3 $ 1,352.3 $ 2,286.8 $ 1,456.8 $ 2,795.4 Petrochemicals and refined products $ 632.1 $ 411.9 $ 220.2 $ -- $ -- Other $ 33.3 $ 9.3 $ 16.9 $ 4.9 $ 2.2 Underlying major volume commitments: Natural gas (in TBtus) 812 265 407 140 -- NGLs (in MMBbls) 7 5 2 -- -- Crude oil (in MMBbls) 471 38 106 94 233 Petrochemicals and refined products (in MMBbls) 11 7 4 -- -- Service payment commitments (5) $ 398.0 $ 98.3 $ 144.5 $ 87.9 $ 67.3 Capital expenditure commitments (6) $ 171.6 $ 171.6 $ -- $ -- $ -- Other long-term liabilities (7) $ 578.4 $ -- $ 370.0 $ 22.4 $ 186.0 Total contractual payment obligations $ 60,850.6 $ 6,723.7 $ 9,117.6 $ 4,998.0 $ 40,011.3 (1) Represents scheduled future maturities of our consolidated debt principal obligations. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2017, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable fixed or variable interest rates paid during 2017. With respect to our variable-rate debt obligations, we applied the weighted-average interest rate paid during 2017 to determine the estimated cash payments. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for the weighted-average variable interest rates charged in 2017. In general, our estimated cash payments for interest are significantly influenced by the long-term maturities of our junior subordinated notes (due August 2066 through August 2077). Our estimated cash payments for interest with respect to each junior subordinated note are based on the current interest rate for each note applied to the entire remaining term through the respective maturity date. (3) Primarily represents land held pursuant to right-of-way agreements and property leases, leases of underground salt dome caverns for the storage of natural gas and NGLs, the lease of transportation equipment used in our operations and office space with affiliates of EPCO. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services as of December 31, 2017. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2017 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Primarily represents our unconditional payment obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts. (6) Represents unconditional payment obligations for services to be rendered or products to be delivered in connection with our capital spending program, including our share of the capital spending of our unconsolidated affiliates. (7) As reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017, “Other long-term liabilities” primarily represent the Liquidity Option Agreement, the noncurrent portion of asset retirement obligations and deferred revenues. In connection with the agreements to acquire EFS Midstream, we are obligated to spend up to an aggregate of $270 million on specified midstream gathering assets for PXD and Reliance, if requested by these producers, over a ten-year period. If constructed, these new assets would be owned by us and be a component of the EFS Midstream System. As of December 31, 2017, we have spent approximately $151 million of the $270 million commitment. Due to the uncertain timing of the remaining potential capital expenditures, we have excluded this amount from the preceding table. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 104 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. General In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding and the discount rates used to determine the present values. The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming: § the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk; § the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and § the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period. We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. Accordingly, the nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed. 105 Table of Contents See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. Commodity Hedging Activities The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps, basis swaps and option contracts. The following table summarizes our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2017 (volume measures as noted): Volume (1) Accounting Derivative Purpose Current (2) Long-Term (2) Treatment Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Octane enhancement: Forecasted purchase of NGLs (MMBbls) 1.1 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of octane enhancement products (MMBbls) 1.0 n/a Cash flow hedge Natural gas marketing: Forecasted purchases of natural gas for fuel (Bcf) 1.0 n/a Cash flow hedge Natural gas storage inventory management activities (Bcf) 3.9 n/a Fair value hedge NGL marketing: Forecasted purchases of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 49.0 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 64.6 n/a Cash flow hedge NGLs inventory management activities (MMBbls) 0.5 n/a Fair value hedge Refined products marketing: Forecasted purchases of refined products (MMBbls) 0.6 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of refined products (MMBbls) 1.3 n/a Cash flow hedge Refined products inventory management activities (MMBbls) 0.5 n/a Fair value hedge Crude oil marketing: Forecasted purchases of crude oil (MMBbls) 3.7 3.3 Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of crude oil (MMBbls) 6.9 3.3 Cash flow hedge Petrochemical marketing: Forecasted purchases of NGLs for propylene marketing activities (MMBbls) 0.8 n/a Cash flow hedge Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas risk management activities (Bcf) (3,4) 67.3 9.0 Mark-to-market NGL risk management activities (MMBbls) (4) 18.3 n/a Mark-to-market Refined products risk management activities (MMBbls) (4) 0.6 n/a Mark-to-market Crude oil risk management activities (MMBbls) (4) 104.0 12.2 Mark-to-market (1) Volume for derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflects the total amount of volumes hedged whereas volume for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflects the absolute value of derivative notional volumes. (2) The maximum term for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is December 2020, May 2018 and December 2020, respectively. (3) Current and long-term volumes include 21.1 Bcf and 5.3 Bcf, respectively, of physical derivative instruments that are predominantly priced at a marked-based index plus a premium or minus a discount related to location differences. (4) Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with transportation, processing and storage assets. At December 31, 2017, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging natural gas processing margins and (iii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory. § The objective of our anticipated future commodity purchases and sales hedging program is to hedge the margins of certain transportation, storage, blending and operational activities by locking in purchase and sale prices through the use of derivative instruments and related contracts. § The objective of our natural gas processing hedging program is to hedge an amount of earnings associated with these activities. We achieve this objective by executing fixed-price sales for a portion of our expected equity NGL production using derivative instruments and related contracts. For certain natural gas processing contracts, the hedging of expected equity NGL production also involves the purchase of natural gas for shrinkage, which is hedged using derivative instruments and related contracts. 106 Table of Contents § The objective of our inventory hedging program is to hedge the fair value of commodity products currently held in inventory by locking in the sales price of the inventory through the use of derivative instruments and related contracts. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our natural gas marketing portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 January 31, 2018 Fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ (5.3 ) $ (13.9 ) $ (6.0 ) Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (9.7 ) (16.9 ) (6.4 ) Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (0.9 ) (10.8 ) (5.6 ) The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our NGL marketing, refined products marketing and octane enhancement portfolios at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 January 31, 2018 Fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ (150.3 ) $ (76.4 ) $ (35.7 ) Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (227.7 ) (126.1 ) (54.1 ) Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (73.0 ) (26.8 ) (17.3 ) The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our crude oil marketing portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 January 31, 2018 Fair value assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ (42.4 ) $ (65.5 ) $ (32.7 ) Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (80.0 ) (109.4 ) (79.3 ) Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) (4.7 ) (21.6 ) 13.9 Interest Rate Hedging Activities We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain consolidated debt agreements. This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. The composition of our derivative instrument portfolios may change depending on our hedging requirements. With respect to the tabular data below, each portfolio’s estimated fair value at a given date is based on a number of factors, including the number and types of derivatives outstanding at that date, the notional value of the swaps and associated interest rates. 107 Table of Contents Interest rate swaps exchange the stated interest rate paid on a notional amount of existing debt for the fixed or floating interest rate stipulated in the derivative instrument.

Except as required by federal and state securities laws, we undertake no obligation 63 Table of Contents to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or any other reason. Overview of Business We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.” We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the U.S., Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. Our midstream energy operations currently include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and export and import terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases, or “LPG,” and ethane); crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and export and import terminals; petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, export and import terminals, and related services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems. Our assets currently include approximately 49,200 miles of pipelines; 260 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products; and 14 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity. The safe operation of our assets is a top priority. We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of the public and those working on our behalf by conducting our business activities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. For additional information, see “Environmental, Safety and Conservation” within the Regulatory Matters section of Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report. We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. We, Enterprise GP, EPCO and Dan Duncan LLC are affiliates under the collective common control of the DD LLC Trustees and the EPCO Trustees. Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the “ASA”) or by other service providers. Our operations are reported under four business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, and (iv) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our related marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measure, for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. Our results of operations and financial condition are subject to certain significant risks. Factors that can affect the demand for our products and services include domestic and international economic conditions, the market price and demand for energy, the cost to develop natural gas and crude oil reserves in the U.S., federal and state regulation, the cost and availability of capital to energy companies to invest in upstream exploration and production activities and the credit quality of our customers. For information regarding such risks, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. In addition, our business activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing a wide variety of topics, including commercial, operational, environmental and other matters. For a discussion of the principal effects of such laws and regulations on our business activities, see “Regulatory Matters” included under Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report. 64 Table of Contents Significant Recent Developments Enterprise Begins Service on the Shin Oak NGL Pipeline In April 2017, we announced plans to build the 658-mile Shin Oak NGL Pipeline to transport growing NGL production from the Permian Basin to our NGL fractionation and storage complex located at the Mont Belvieu hub. The Mont Belvieu area in Chambers County, Texas, with its significant energy-related infrastructure, is a key hub of the global NGL industry (the “Mont Belvieu hub”). In February 2019, the 24-inch diameter mainline segment of the Shin Oak NGL Pipeline from Orla, Texas to Mont Belvieu was placed into limited commercial service with an initial transportation capacity of 250 MBPD. Completion of the related 20-inch diameter Waha lateral is scheduled for the second quarter of 2019. Supported by long-term customer commitments, the Shin Oak NGL Pipeline will ultimately provide up to 550 MBPD of transportation capacity, which is expected to be available in the fourth quarter of 2019. In May 2018, Apache Corporation (“Apache”) executed a long-term supply agreement to sell all of its NGL production from the Alpine High discovery to us. Alpine High is a major hydrocarbon resource located in the Delaware Basin that encompasses rich and dry natural gas and oil-bearing horizons. Apache holds approximately 336,000 net acres in the Alpine High discovery. Enterprise has committed to purchase up to 205 MBPD of NGLs from Apache over the initial ten-year term of the supply agreement, the term of which may be extended at the consent of the parties. In conjunction with the long-term NGL supply agreement, we granted Apache an option to acquire up to a 33% equity interest in our subsidiary that owns the Shin Oak NGL Pipeline. In November 2018, Apache contributed this option to Altus Midstream Company, which is a majority-owned subsidiary of Apache. The option is exercisable within sixty days after certain completion milestones are met (as defined in the underlying agreements), which we expect to occur in the second quarter of 2019. Enterprise Announces $2 Billion Unit Buyback Program; Provides 2019 Distribution Guidance In January 2019, we announced that the Board of Enterprise GP had approved a $2.0 billion multi-year unit buyback program, which provides the partnership with an additional method to return capital to investors. The program authorizes the partnership to repurchase its common units from time to time, including through open market purchases and negotiated transactions. The timing and pace of buy backs under the program will be determined by a number of factors including (i) our financial performance and flexibility, (ii) organic growth and acquisition opportunities with higher potential returns on investment, (iii) our unit price and implied distributable cash flow yield and (iv) maintaining targeted financial leverage with a debt-to-normalized adjusted EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, ratio in the 3.5 times area. No time limit has been set for completion of the buyback program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Also, based on current expectations, management announced its plans to continue to recommend to the Board an increase of $0.0025 per unit per quarter to our cash distribution rate with respect to 2019. The anticipated rate of increase would result in distributions for 2019 (of $1.7650 per unit) being 2.3% higher than those paid for 2018 (of $1.7250 per unit). The payment of any quarterly cash distribution is subject to Board approval and management’s evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in connection with such payment. Service Begins on the Midland-to-ECHO 2 Pipeline System The Midland-to-ECHO 2 Pipeline System, which began limited commercial service in February 2019, provides us with approximately 200 MBPD of incremental crude oil transportation capacity from the Permian Basin to markets in the Houston area. The pipeline is expected to enter full commercial service in April 2019. The pipeline originates at our Midland terminal and extends 440 miles to our Sealy terminal, with volumes arriving at Sealy transported to our ECHO terminal using the Rancho II pipeline, which is a component of our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System. We converted a portion of our Seminole NGL Pipeline system from NGL service to crude oil service to create the Midland-to-Sealy segment of this pipeline system. The conversion is supported by a 10.75-year transportation contract with firm demand fees. The conversion does not reduce our NGL transportation capacity since displaced NGLs are transported using our other NGL pipelines, including our Shin Oak NGL Pipeline. Furthermore, we have the ability to convert this pipeline back to NGL service should market and physical takeaway conditions warrant. 65 Table of Contents Enterprise Increasing NGL Fractionation Capacity in Texas and Louisiana The demand for NGL fractionation capacity continues to expand as producers in domestic shale plays like the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford and Denver-Julesburg (“DJ”) Basin seek market access and end users require supply assurance. In light of this ongoing trend, we are constructing a new NGL fractionation facility in Chambers County, Texas adjacent to our existing Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation complex. The new facility will consist of two fractionation trains capable of processing a combined 300 MBPD of NGLs. The first of the two fractionation trains will have a nameplate capacity of 150 MBPD and is scheduled to be completed and begin service in the fourth quarter of 2019. The second of these fractionation trains will also have a nameplate capacity of 150 MBPD, and is scheduled to begin service in the first half of 2020. In November 2018, we announced a project to optimize our Shoup NGL fractionator located in Nueces County, Texas by expanding and repurposing a portion of our South Texas pipelines. This project would entail the construction of approximately 21 miles of new pipeline along with the conversion of approximately 65 miles of existing natural gas pipelines to NGL service, which will allow us to supply Shoup with an additional 25 MBPD of NGL volumes. The expanded pipeline capacity is expected to be available in the third quarter of 2019. We restarted our Tebone NGL fractionator located in Ascension Parish, Louisiana in February 2019. Tebone has a fractionation capacity of 30 MBPD and is connected by pipeline to each of our Louisiana natural gas processing plants, as well as our Mont Belvieu storage complex. The resumption of service at Tebone complements our operations at the Norco and Promix NGL fractionators and provides us with another processing option for NGLs delivered to the Mont Belvieu hub. The construction of our new 300 MBPD NGL fractionation facility at our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation complex, the optimization of our Shoup facility and restart of our Tebone fractionator highlights the flexibility of our integrated midstream network and provides a timely, efficient and cost-effective solution for accommodating growing production from domestic shale basins. Once these projects are fully complete, total NGL fractionation capacity across our network would increase to approximately 1.1 MMBPD in the Mont Belvieu area, and approximately 1.5 MMBPD company-wide. Enterprise Begins Construction of Seventh Natural Gas Processing Plant in Delaware Basin; Second Train at Orla Natural Gas Processing Plant Begins Service In October 2018, we announced that construction of our Mentone cryogenic natural gas processing plant had commenced. The Mentone plant, which is located in Loving County, Texas, is expected to have the capacity to process 300 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract in excess of 40 MBPD of NGLs. The project is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2020 and is supported by a long-term acreage dedication agreement. The Mentone plant further extends our presence in the growing Delaware Basin and provides access to our fully integrated midstream asset network serving domestic and international markets. To support development of the Mentone plant, we are constructing approximately 70 miles of gathering and residue pipelines and expanding compression capabilities. These projects will allow the Mentone plant to link to our NGL system, including the Shin Oak NGL Pipeline which entered limited commercial service in February 2019, as well as our Texas Intrastate System. We will own and operate the Mentone facility and related infrastructure. The Mentone plant will complement our existing cryogenic natural gas processing plant located near Orla, Texas in Reeves County. In May 2018 and October 2018, we commenced operations of the first and second processing trains (Orla I and Orla II), respectively, at the facility. A third processing train (Orla III) is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of 2019. We own and operate the Orla facility. In conjunction with the start-up of Orla I, we placed into service approximately 70 miles of natural gas pipelines that connect the Orla facility to our Texas Intrastate System. We also placed into service a 30-mile extension of our NGL system that provides producers at the Orla facility with NGL takeaway capacity and direct access to our integrated network of downstream NGL assets. When the Mentone plant is completed and placed into service, we expect to have an aggregate 1.6 Bcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 250 MBPD of NGL production from our processing plants in the Delaware Basin. 66 Table of Contents CME Group Launches Physical West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) Houston Crude Oil Futures Contract In September 2018, the CME Group, a leading derivatives marketplace, announced that suppliers, refiners and end users of U.S. crude oil have a new way to price and hedge WTI in Houston, Texas. Participants will have the flexibility to make or take delivery of WTI at our ECHO terminal, Enterprise Hydrocarbons Terminal (“EHT”) or pipeline interconnect at Genoa Junction. The new futures contracts received regulatory approval in October 2018 and are listed with and subject to the rules of the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”), beginning with the January 2019 contract month. Enterprise Expanding LPG Capacity at Houston Ship Channel Terminal In September 2018, we announced a project to increase LPG loading capacity at EHT by 175 MBPD, or approximately 5 MMBbls per month. The expansion will bring our total LPG export capacity at EHT to 720 MBPD, or approximately 21 MMBbls per month. Upon completion of this expansion project, EHT will have the capability to load up to six Very Large Gas Carrier (“VLGC”) vessels simultaneously, while maintaining the option to switch between loading propane and butane. Once operational, the expansion will allow EHT to load a single VLGC in less than 24 hours, creating greater efficiencies and cost savings for our customers. The incremental loading capacity is expected to be available in the third quarter of 2019. Enterprise to Develop Offshore Texas Crude Oil Export Terminal In July 2018, management announced that we are in the planning stage to develop a crude oil export terminal located offshore along the Texas Gulf Coast. The terminal would be capable of fully loading Very Large Crude Carrier (“VLCC”) marine tankers, which have capacities of approximately 2 MMBbls and provide the most efficient and cost-effective solution to export crude oil to the largest international markets in Asia and Europe. We started front-end engineering and design work for the terminal in 2018 and filed our application for regulatory permitting with the Maritime Administration (“MARAD”) in January 2019. Based on initial designs, the project could include pipelines extending from onshore facilities to an offshore terminal loading crude oil for export at approximately 85,000 barrels per hour. A final investment decision for the project will be subject to receiving state and federal permits and customer demand. Seaway Commences Loading Services for VLCC Tankers In June 2018, we commenced the loading of VLCC tankers using a combination of our jointly owned Seaway marine terminal located in Texas City, Texas and lightering operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Approximately 1.1 MMBbls of crude oil were loaded onto the FPMC C Melody at the Texas City marine terminal and the remainder of the crude oil shipment was loaded on the VLCC in a lightering zone in the Gulf of Mexico. The FPMC C Melody, chartered by Vitol, Inc., was the first VLCC to be loaded at a Texas port. The Seaway marine terminal features two docks, a 45-foot draft, an overall length of 1,125 feet, a 200-foot beam (width) and the capacity to load crude oil at a rate of 35,000 barrels per hour. Affiliate of Western Gas Acquires 20% Ownership Interest in Portion of Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System In June 2018, an affiliate of Western Gas Partners, LP (“Western”) acquired a noncontrolling 20% equity interest in our subsidiary, Whitethorn Pipeline Company LLC (“Whitethorn”), for $189.6 million in cash. Whitethorn owns the majority of our Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System, which originates at our Midland terminal and extends 418 miles to our Sealy terminal. Volumes arriving at Sealy are then transported to our ECHO terminal using our Rancho II pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System provides Permian Basin producers with the ability to transport multiple grades of crude oil, including WTI, Light WTI, West Texas Sour, and condensate, to Gulf Coast markets. As a result of operating enhancements and supplementary infrastructure, the pipeline’s transportation capacity is expected to increase to 620 MBPD beginning in March 2019. We report the pipeline’s transportation volumes on a net basis that reflects our 80% interest. Upon closing of the transaction whereby Western acquired its 20% equity interest in Whitethorn, we credited Western for 20% of the pipeline’s earnings since it was placed into service in November 2017. We paid Western $45.7 million in June 2018 to settle this obligation. 67 Table of Contents Construction Begins on Ethylene Export Dock In May 2018, we announced that construction of our ethylene export terminal located at Morgan’s Point on the Houston Ship Channel had commenced. When completed, the terminal, which we will operate, is expected to have an export capacity of approximately 2.2 billion pounds of ethylene per year, with loading rates of 2.2 million pounds per hour, and feature on-site refrigerated storage for 66 million pounds of ethylene. The project, which is underwritten by long-term customer commitments, is expected to begin limited commercial service in the fourth quarter of 2019, with full operations expected in the fourth quarter of 2020 once certain refrigeration assets are complete. We own a 50% equity interest in Enterprise Navigator Ethylene Terminal LLC, which owns the export terminal. Enterprise and Energy Transfer form Joint Venture to Restore Service on Old Ocean Pipeline In May 2018, we announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture with Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (“ETP”) to resume full service on the Old Ocean natural gas pipeline owned by ETP. The 24-inch diameter Old Ocean Pipeline originates in Maypearl, Texas in Ellis County and extends south approximately 240 miles to Sweeny, Texas in Brazoria County. ETP serves as operator of the pipeline, which has a natural gas transportation capacity of 160 MMcf/d. Repairs were completed on the pipeline and it entered full service in January 2019. In addition, both parties expanded their jointly owned North Texas 36-inch diameter natural gas pipeline, which is a component of our Texas Intrastate System. The expansion project was completed in January 2019 and provides us with additional natural gas takeaway capacity of 150 MMcf/d from West Texas, including deliveries into the Old Ocean Pipeline. The resumption of full service on the Old Ocean Pipeline and expansion of the North Texas Pipeline provide producers with additional takeaway capacity to accommodate growing natural gas production from the Delaware and Midland Basins. Expansions of our Front Range and Texas Express Pipelines In May 2018, we conducted open commitment periods to determine shipper interest in expansions of the Front Range Pipeline (“Front Range”) and Texas Express Pipeline (“Texas Express”). Given the positive responses we received from shippers, we are proceeding with the expansion projects. We own a 33.3% equity interest in Front Range and a 35% equity interest in Texas Express. We operate both pipelines. The expansions are designed to facilitate growing production of NGLs from domestic shale basins, including the DJ Basin in Colorado, by providing DJ Basin producers with flow assurance and greater access to the Gulf Coast markets. The expansions are expected to increase the transportation capacity of Front Range and Texas Express by 100 MBPD and 90 MBPD, respectively. We anticipate the expansion projects will be placed into service during the third quarter of 2019. Acquisition of Remaining 50% Ownership Interest in Delaware Processing In March 2018, we acquired the remaining 50% member interest in our Delaware Basin Gas Processing LLC (“Delaware Processing”) joint venture for $150.6 million in cash, net of $3.9 million of cash held by the former joint venture. Delaware Processing owns a cryogenic natural gas processing facility (our “Waha” gas plant) having a capacity of 150 MMcf/d. The Waha plant is located in Reeves County, Texas and entered service in August 2016. The acquired business serves growing production of NGL-rich natural gas from the Delaware Basin in West Texas and southern New Mexico. For information regarding this acquisition, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Enterprise to Expand Butane Isomerization Facility In January 2018, we announced plans to expand our butane isomerization facility by up to 30 MBPD of incremental capacity. The expansion is supported by long-term agreements to provide butane isomerization, storage and related pipeline services. We currently expect this project to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2021. 68 Table of Contents General Outlook for 2019 We provide midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are contingent on the supply of and demand for the energy commodities we handle across our integrated midstream energy asset network. The following information presents our views on key midstream energy supply and demand fundamentals as they impact our operations going into 2019. Supply Side Observations The upstream energy industry, including major oil companies, continues to shift resources to shale supply basins. We believe that U.S. shale resources provide attractive economic benefits to producers due to their low risk and short lead time production profiles. Domestic shale resources will continue to play a key role in both U.S. and global markets, further supporting that the U.S. is a major oil supplier on par with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and Russia. During most of 2018, international energy commodity markets were supported as demand for crude oil was strong due to expanding global economic activity, while crude oil supplies were viewed as balanced and maintained through a regime of prescriptive supply cuts by OPEC and Russia. As a result crude oil prices improved significantly: WTI averaged $50.86 per barrel in 2017 and rose to $76.41 by early October 2018. Meanwhile, U.S. oil production rose steadily during that period averaging 9.4 MMBPD in 2017 and reached a record 11.8 MMBPD by December 2018. Likewise, U.S. production of NGLs averaged 3.8 MMBPD in 2017 and increased to 4.7 MMBPD by November 2018, a new record as well. U.S. crude oil and NGL production was expected to average 10.9 MMBPD and 4.4 MBPD, respectively, in 2018. However, beginning in October 2018, signs of weakness began emerging in global energy markets due to perceived overproduction of crude oil and NGLs in the U.S. The impact of trade wars between the U.S., China and other developed economies, along with potential signs of economic slowdown in many developing economies, started eroding confidence in global demand. Also, there was uncertainty regarding how U.S. sanctions on Iran would be administered and their effect on Iranian oil exports. As a result, WTI oil prices tumbled from the high of $76.41 per barrel in early October 2018 to end the year at $45.41 per barrel, a decline of 41%. WTI prices averaged $64.90 per barrel for all of 2018. In response to the rapid decline in crude oil prices, OPEC and Russia agreed to cut their overall production by 1.2 MMBPD during the first half of 2019, with 800 MBPD shouldered by OPEC and the remainder by Russia and other non-OPEC countries. All in all, OPEC and Russia reduced their production in 2017, 2018 and into 2019 as they adjust to the new reality. The U.S. has now secured its place as a major global oil supplier with production levels that match, if not surpass, Russia and Saudi Arabia. As such, the new imperative for non-U.S. producers is the delicate balancing of U.S., OPEC (primarily Saudi Arabia) and Russian production, while attempting to maintain crude oil prices at a level that ensures production doesn’t grow too fast, but not too low as to cause massive fiscal deficits in oil producing nations that could threaten their political stability. With the growth in domestic shale resources, U.S. natural gas production has increased significantly over the past few years with production estimates of 89 Bcf/d at the end of 2018. As a result, natural gas prices have been suppressed in recent years as a result of strong domestic supplies exceeding demand, particularly for heating needs as recent average winter temperatures have been warmer. As measured by the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) at Henry Hub, natural gas prices for 2018 ranged from a high of $4.84 per MMBtu to a low of $2.55 per MMBtu, while averaging $3.07 per MMBtu. We believe that natural gas prices for 2019 will continue in a similar range. Natural gas production should be sufficient to meet both domestic and export demand, regardless of periodic fluctuations in demand and prices attributable to weather events. U.S. exploration and production companies have shown that they can grow shale production at crude oil prices approximating $50 per barrel and higher. Drilling technology continues to improve, which enables producers to drill and complete non-conventional wells more efficiently. These improvements include faster drilling techniques, longer horizontal well laterals, higher density fracture treatments, and increased proppant concentration. Given that crude oil prices in 2018 were supportive of production growth, rig counts in the U.S. increased 17% during the year to 1,083 69 Table of Contents at December 31, 2018. However, not all regions have reacted equally to the recovery in rig counts, with the largest increases seen in the Permian Basin (22% increase in 2018) and Eagle Ford Shale (14% increase in 2018). As more wells were drilled in 2018, most shale basins experienced a shortage of completion equipment and crews, which forced producers to defer completions and build their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells (“DUCs”). Rig counts plateaued during the second half of 2018, whereas the DUC count increased by 17% during the same period. The DUC count reached approximately 8,600 in December 2018 as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), a 31% increase over the comparable December 2017 amount. More specifically, the Permian basin saw its DUC count increase 77% during 2018 as infrastructure constraints persisted, especially during the third quarter of 2018. The overall increase in DUCs represents a significant potential volume that we believe could be brought into production starting in 2019. We believe that NGL production will benefit disproportionately as these wells are brought online as producers seek greater returns from pursuing rich natural gas at the expense of dry gas wells, and from associated natural gas and NGLs produced in connection with higher crude oil production. We operate in a number of major supply basins, including the Permian, Eagle Ford Shale, Haynesville Shale and Rockies. The following information represents our outlook for each of these basins: § The Permian Basin in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico has experienced the largest increase in drilling activity in the country, with 486 active rigs in December 2018. The basin continues to have many advantages relative to other producing regions, including stacked pay zones, light sweet crude oil and significant infrastructure. Based on producer feedback and forecasts, we believe that there is significant support for the construction of incremental midstream infrastructure in the basin. An area of focus for us has been the development of midstream infrastructure serving producers in the Delaware Basin, which is part of the overall Permian Basin. Historically, the Delaware Basin has been a relatively lightly drilled area due to a lack of conventional targets. However, with the introduction of horizontal drilling and identification of stacked targets of tight-rock and shales, drilling in the Delaware Basin has accelerated over the past five years. These drilling targets have proven to produce not only crude oil but condensate and NGLs, which present us a significant number of opportunities to provide midstream services to producers. We are actively working with producers to identify those midstream infrastructure projects that will best serve their needs and also complement our integrated asset network. Two examples of our initiatives in the Delaware Basin are the Orla and Mentone natural gas processing plants. During 2018, we placed two processing trains (Orla I and II) into service at Orla with a third (Orla III) expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2019. Once Orla III is completed, the Orla facility will have 900 MMcf/d of total processing capacity and allow us to extract up to 120 MBPD of mixed NGLs. Our Mentone facility was announced in October 2018 and is scheduled to enter service during the first quarter of 2020. When the Mentone plant is completed and placed into service, we expect to have an aggregate 1.6 Bcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 250 MBPD of NGL production from our processing plants in the Delaware Basin. Our Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System, which became fully operational in the second quarter of 2018, provides Permian Basin producers with the ability to transport multiple grades of crude oil on a segregated basis to Gulf Coast and international markets, thus maintaining and assuring the quality and grade of the final product. As a result of operating enhancements and supplementary infrastructure, the transportation capacity of the Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System is expected to increase to 620 MBPD beginning in March 2019. In addition, we placed our Midland-to-ECHO 2 Pipeline System into limited commercial service in February 2019, with full service expected in April 2019. The Midland-to-ECHO 2 Pipeline System provides us with approximately 200 MBPD of incremental crude oil transportation capacity from the Permian Basin to markets in the Houston area. We are also evaluating several other natural gas, NGL and crude oil projects in the Permian Basin. § Crude oil and natural gas production in the Eagle Ford Shale is increasing due to higher rig counts and improved drilling efficiencies. The number of drilling rigs in the Eagle Ford Shale increased to 81 active rigs in December 2018 compared to a low of 29 rigs during the downturn in 2016. According to the EIA Drilling Productivity Report, the most recent data (December 2018) for production in the Eagle Ford Region was 1.4 MMBPD of crude oil and 7.0 Bcf/d of natural gas. 70 Table of Contents Production acreage continues to change ownership in the Eagle Ford Shale, with over 1.5 million acres changing hands in 2018 and we expect this trend to continue. We believe that additional rigs will be brought to the basin as a result of the ownership changes, which could result in higher volumes for our midstream network; however, until volumes for the basin exceed historical peak production, there will likely be excess capacity of midstream infrastructure available in the region. The historical peak for Eagle Ford Region crude oil and natural gas production occurred in March 2015 and was 1.7 MMBPD and 7.4 Bcf/d, respectively. We also believe that the Eagle Ford Shale offers producers some of the best returns on capital of any region in the country due to its proximity to major consumption and export markets along the U.S. Gulf Coast and that midstream companies like us, with deep integrated networks, will enjoy the greatest operating leverage as production increases. § Natural gas production in the Haynesville Shale is also increasing due to higher rig counts and improved drilling efficiencies. The number of drilling rigs in the basin has increased from a low of 11 rigs in 2016 to 52 rigs in December 2018. Like the Eagle Ford Shale, we have seen several significant changes in the ownership of producing properties over the past year, which has contributed to increased drilling activity in the region by the new owners. The historical peak for natural gas production in the Haynesville region occurred in 2011 and was over 10.5 Bcf/d. According to the December 2018 EIA Drilling Productivity Report, Haynesville Region natural gas production was 9.8 Bcf/d. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated in its 2017 assessment that the Haynesville Shale and the associated Bossier shale plays hold a combined 304 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas resources, the second highest level in the U.S. after the Appalachia region. The Haynesville Shale benefits from its close proximity to Gulf Coast markets where substantial petrochemical and liquefied natural gas, or LNG, export projects are being constructed. At expected natural gas price levels, we estimate that natural gas production from the Haynesville Shale will continue to increase; however, until volumes for the basin exceed historical peak production, there will likely be excess capacity of midstream infrastructure available in the region. § With respect to oil and gas production in the Rocky Mountain region, rig counts have declined slightly in the Jonah and Pinedale fields and are flat in the Piceance and San Juan basins. Producers plan to continue horizontal drilling in the Jonah field; however, horizontal drilling in the Pinedale field has generally been put on hold pending further study. Drilling has continued steadily in the Piceance field, with operators permitting the horizontal Williams Fork locations. Additional resources exist in the Piceance field in the deeper Mancos play, but it is currently not being developed. There were several changes in the ownership of producing properties in the San Juan basin this past year that are expected to lead to a modest increase in drilling activity by the new owners. The Rockies benefit from sufficient natural gas and NGL pipeline infrastructure, which helps the region compete with other North American regions where production takeaway capacity may be constrained. We believe that our Rocky Mountain assets will continue to benefit regional producers by giving them access to major downstream markets such as the U.S. Gulf Coast and export destinations. With stable to higher energy commodity prices and continued improvements in drilling and completion technologies, we expect continued strong investments, including both drilling and well completion activities, by producers during 2019 in and around our assets in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Haynesville Shale and Rocky Mountain regions. Furthermore, we believe that our assets in these areas are very competitive in providing midstream services. We also believe that production basins, along with supporting midstream infrastructure such as our integrated network, located closest to prime markets on the U.S. Gulf Coast will continue to be preferred by producers due to more favorable economics as compared to other more distant areas (mostly due to lower transportation costs). Demand Side Observations Global economic growth continues to drive increasing demand for petroleum-based products. In December 2018, the International Energy Agency (“IEA”) reported that global demand for crude oil and NGLs grew by a combined 1.3 MMBPD in 2018 and expects demand to grow by 1.4 MMBPD in 2019. The IEA anticipates that overall demand for crude oil and NGLs by the countries represented by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) would decline by approximately 0.7 MMBPD between 2019 and 2023, while non-OECD demand would increase by 5 MMBPD over the same period. The IEA expects that petrochemicals will account for approximately 40% of the increase in global demand for crude oil and NGLs over this period. 71 Table of Contents The North American “shale revolution” has made the U.S. the global, low-cost supplier of NGLs. We expect this trend to continue into 2019 and beyond supported by, among other things, the ability of U.S. shale producers to improve productivity and reduce development costs, higher demand in developing economies for crude oil and related hydrocarbons, and regulatory changes favoring the use of clean-burning fuels and low-sulfur hydrocarbons such as those found in domestic shale oil basins. We continue to foresee a variety of long-term demand-side opportunities from these developments, including higher demand from a resurgent U.S. petrochemical industry and increased exports of hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, LPG and crude oil) to growing international markets. With respect to the domestic petrochemical industry, abundant supplies of shale-sourced ethane provides the U.S. with one of the cheapest feedstocks available for ethylene production. The American Chemistry Council estimates that over $200 billion is being invested in domestic chemical production, with most of those investments tied directly to producing ethylene from cost-advantaged U.S. ethane. We believe that domestic demand for ethane is expected to continue growing as several new world-scale ethylene plants begin operations in 2019 and on through the early 2020s. Furthermore, virtually every ethane-consuming chemical plant in the U.S. is in close proximity to our existing assets. Of the new domestic chemical plants, four are currently operational and have a combined ethylene production capacity of 11.1 billion pounds per year and ethane consumption rate of approximately 310 MBPD. An additional five plants are expected to enter service in 2019, with a combined ethylene production capacity of 10.5 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 295 MBPD, and another four in the early 2020s. The plants expected to enter service in the early 2020s are expected to have a combined ethylene production capacity of 10.8 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 295 MBPD. We also anticipate demand growth for ethane as a feedstock resulting from modifications made to other existing domestic facilities (e.g., debottlenecking, furnace modifications, etc.). As a result of the expected growth in U.S. ethylene production capacity, we are constructing an ethylene export terminal located at Morgan’s Point on the Houston Ship Channel. The project, which is underwritten by long-term customer commitments, is expected to begin limited commercial service in the fourth quarter of 2019, with full operations expected in the fourth quarter of 2020 once certain refrigeration assets are complete. International demand for U.S. ethane is expected to remain robust in 2019, as ethane from domestic shale basins also offers the global petrochemical industry a low-cost feedstock option plus supply diversification. Our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, the largest of its kind in the world, enables us to meet this demand and has an aggregate loading rate (nameplate capacity) of approximately 10,000 barrels per hour of fully refrigerated ethane. Ethane prices were volatile in 2018 primarily due to supply and demand imbalances attributable to infrastructure gaps (e.g., NGL pipeline and fractionation capacity constraints). We, along with others in the midstream industry, are actively working to resolve these constraints. Overall, the industry expects to place over 1.8 MMBPD of pipeline capacity and 1.7 MMBPD of fractionation capacity into service between 2019 through 2021. However, due to uncertainty regarding the exact start-up dates for several ethane-oriented petrochemical plants, additional volatility in ethane prices cannot be ruled out in 2019. We believe that U.S. exports of LPG to Asia, particularly China and India, and markets in Northwest Europe and Central and South America will continue to be strong. Per the EIA, U.S. LPG exports increased 9% in 2018 to 1,147 MBPD, based on data available through November 2018, with volumes headed to Asian markets accounting for approximately 50% of this amount (substantially all of which originated from our marine terminals). Our outlook for LPG exports to Asia is supported by a number of factors including: (i) continued economic expansion in emerging Asian markets; (ii) the widening of the Panama Canal, which was completed in 2016; and (iii) favorable domestic policies in countries like India and Indonesia where the governments are subsidizing the switch to LPG for domestic use as a means for reducing pollution and protecting against deforestation. Due to our expectation of continued growth in LPG exports, we announced a project to increase LPG loading capacity at EHT by 175 MBPD, or approximately 5 MMBbls per month. The incremental LPG loading capacity at EHT is expected to be available in the third quarter of 2019. 72 Table of Contents Finally, as crude oil production in the U.S. has increased, these new domestic barrels continue to supplant more of the U.S.’s crude oil imports, while the remainder is exported to international markets in Central and South America, Asia and Western Europe where the lighter U.S. crudes are used as feedstock in their refining facilities. We also expect U.S. refiners to continue to operate at high rates as a result of steady U.S. demand and growing exports of refined products. We believe that our marine terminals and related storage and pipeline infrastructure that handle crude oil and refined products are strategically located to meet the concurrent needs of export and import customers. We have significant export capabilities on the Houston Ship Channel at EHT and at Beaumont, Freeport and Texas City, Texas.

(2) Midland and Houston crude oil prices are based on commercial index prices as reported by Argus. (3) Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) prices are based on commercial index prices as reported by Platts. Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices. Energy commodity prices fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including supply and demand imbalances and geopolitical tensions. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.82 per gallon in 2018 compared to $0.69 per gallon in 2017 and $0.50 per gallon in 2016. An increase in our consolidated marketing revenues due to higher energy commodity sales prices may not result in an increase in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also be higher due to comparable increases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same relationship would be true in the case of lower energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs. We attempt to mitigate commodity price exposure through our hedging activities and the use of fee-based arrangements. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities. 74 Table of Contents Income Statement Highlights The following table summarizes the key components of our consolidated results of operations for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Revenues $ 36,534.2 $ 29,241.5 $ 23,022.3 Costs and expenses: Operating costs and expenses: Cost of sales 26,789.8 21,487.0 15,710.9 Other operating costs and expenses 2,898.7 2,500.1 2,425.6 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 1,687.0 1,531.3 1,456.7 Net gains attributable to asset sales (28.7 ) (10.7 ) (2.5 ) Asset impairment and related charges 50.5 49.8 52.8 Total operating costs and expenses 31,397.3 25,557.5 19,643.5 General and administrative costs 208.3 181.1 160.1 Total costs and expenses 31,605.6 25,738.6 19,803.6 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 480.0 426.0 362.0 Operating income 5,408.6 3,928.9 3,580.7 Interest expense (1,096.7 ) (984.6 ) (982.6 ) Change in fair value of Liquidity Option Agreement (56.1 ) (64.3 ) (24.5 ) Other, net 43.0 1.3 2.8 Provision for income taxes (60.3 ) (25.7 ) (23.4 ) Net income 4,238.5 2,855.6 2,553.0 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (66.1 ) (56.3 ) (39.9 ) Net income attributable to limited partners $ 4,172.4 $ 2,799.3 $ 2,513.1 Revenues The following table presents each business segment’s contribution to consolidated revenues for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 NGL Pipelines & Services: Sales of NGLs and related products $ 12,920.9 $ 10,521.3 $ 8,380.5 Midstream services 2,728.0 1,946.7 1,862.0 Total 15,648.9 12,468.0 10,242.5 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services: Sales of crude oil 10,001.2 7,365.2 5,802.5 Midstream services 1,041.4 791.6 712.5 Total 11,042.6 8,156.8 6,515.0 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services: Sales of natural gas 2,411.7 2,238.5 1,591.9 Midstream services 1,042.7 907.1 951.1 Total 3,454.4 3,145.6 2,543.0 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services: Sales of petrochemicals and refined products 5,535.4 4,696.3 2,921.9 Midstream services 852.9 774.8 799.9 Total 6,388.3 5,471.1 3,721.8 Total revenues $ 36,534.2 $ 29,241.5 $ 23,022.3 For periods through December 31, 2017, we accounted for our revenue streams using Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605, Revenue Recognition. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using a modified retrospective approach that applied the new revenue recognition standard to existing contracts at the implementation date and any future revenue contracts. For additional information regarding our consolidated revenues, including the adoption of ASC 606, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 75 Table of Contents Comparison of 2018 with 2017 Total revenues for 2018 increased $7.29 billion when compared to 2017 primarily due to a $6.05 billion increase in marketing revenues. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil increased $2.64 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $1.99 billion increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $646.3 million increase. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs, petrochemicals and refined products increased a net $3.24 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $3.39 billion increase, partially offset by a $149.2 million decrease due to lower sales volumes. Revenues from midstream services for 2018 increased $1.24 billion when compared to 2017. As a result of adopting ASC 606, we recognized $621.7 million in connection with the receipt of non-cash consideration for providing natural gas processing services during 2018. Midstream service revenues from our pipeline assets increased $481.4 million year-to-year primarily due to strong demand for transportation services in Texas and on the ATEX Pipeline. Comparison of 2017 with 2016 Total revenues for 2017 increased $6.22 billion when compared to total revenues for 2016. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, refined products and octane additives increased $3.98 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $2.75 billion increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $1.23 billion increase. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs increased $2.14 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $3.19 billion increase, partially offset by a $1.05 billion decrease due to lower sales volumes. Revenues from midstream services increased $94.7 million year-to-year primarily due to the ongoing expansion of our operations, including a $54.6 million increase attributable to our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal that was placed into service in September 2016. Largest customer information Substantially all of our consolidated revenues are earned in the U.S. and derived from a wide customer base. Our largest non-affiliated customer for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was Vitol Holding B.V. and its affiliates (collectively, “Vitol”), which accounted for 7.8%, 11.2% and 9.9%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Vitol is a global energy and commodity trading company. Operating costs and expenses Comparison of 2018 with 2017 Total operating costs and expenses for 2018 increased $5.84 billion when compared to 2017 primarily due to a $5.3 billion increase in cost of sales. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil increased $2.16 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher purchase prices, which accounted for a $1.59 billion increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $562.4 million increase. The cost of sales associated with our NGL marketing activities increased $3.09 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $2.51 billion increase. In addition, the cost of sales attributable to our NGL marketing activities for 2018 includes $621.7 million resulting from the adoption of ASC 606 and attributable to the sale and delivery of equity NGL products to customers. Other operating costs and expenses for 2018 increased $398.6 million when compared to 2017 primarily due to higher maintenance, power and employee compensation costs. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $155.7 million year-to-year primarily due to assets we constructed and placed into service since 2017. Gains related to the sale of assets increased $18.0 million year-to-year primarily due to the sale of our Red River System in October 2018. Operating costs and expenses also include $50.5 million and $49.8 million of non-cash asset impairment and related charges for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our nonrecurring fair value measurements. 76 Table of Contents Comparison of 2017 with 2016 Total operating costs and expenses for 2017 increased $5.91 billion when compared to total operating costs and expenses for 2016. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil, natural gas, petrochemicals and refined products increased $3.59 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher purchase prices, which accounted for a $2.52 billion increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $1.06 billion increase. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs increased a net $2.19 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher purchase prices, which accounted for a $3.06 billion increase, partially offset by an $873.9 million decrease due to lower sales volumes. Other operating costs and expenses for 2017 increased a net $74.5 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to higher employee compensation, power, ad valorem tax and maintenance costs. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses for 2017 increased a net $74.6 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to assets we constructed and placed into service since 2016. Operating costs and expenses also include $49.8 million and $52.8 million of non-cash asset impairment and related charges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. General and administrative costs General and administrative costs for 2018 increased $27.2 million when compared to 2017 primarily due to higher employee compensation and legal costs. General and administrative costs for 2017 increased $21.0 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to higher legal, regulatory and employee compensation costs. Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2018 increased $54.0 million when compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in earnings from our investments in NGL pipelines. Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2017 increased a net $64.0 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in earnings from our investments in crude oil pipeline ventures. Operating income Operating income for 2018 increased $1.48 billion when compared 2017 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Likewise, operating income for 2017 increased $348.2 million when compared to 2016. Interest expense The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 1,195.4 $ 1,110.4 $ 1,088.9 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization (1) 8.1 38.2 30.5 Interest costs capitalized in connection with construction projects (2) (147.9 ) (192.1 ) (168.2 ) Other (3) 41.1 28.1 31.4 Total interest expense $ 1,096.7 $ 984.6 $ 982.6 (1) Amount presented for 2018 is net of $29.4 million of swaption premium income, which reduces interest expense. (2) We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital investment levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. (3) Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs. Amount presented for 2018 includes $14.2 million of debt issuance costs that were written off in connection with the redemption of junior subordinated notes. 77 Table of Contents Comparison of 2018 with 2017 Interest expense for 2018 increased $112.1 million when compared to 2017. Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is the primary driver of interest expense, increased a net $85.0 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2018, which accounted for an $85.6 million increase. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2018 was $25.94 billion compared to $24.13 billion for 2017. In general, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital investments. For a discussion of our consolidated debt obligations and capital investments, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Capital Investments,” respectively, within this Part II, Item 7 of this annual report. Comparison of 2017 with 2016 Interest expense for 2017 increased $2.0 million when compared to 2016. Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is the primary driver of interest expense, increased a net $21.5 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2017, which accounted for a $31.6 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates in 2017, which accounted for a $10.1 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2017 was $24.13 billion compared to $23.41 billion for 2016. Change in fair value of Liquidity Option Agreement We recognize non-cash expense associated with accretion and changes in management estimates that affect our valuation of the Liquidity Option Agreement. For information regarding the Liquidity Option Agreement, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Comparison of 2018 with 2017 Liquidity option expense decreased $8.2 million in 2018 when compared to 2017 due to the effect of changes in management estimates, which accounted for a $13.6 million decrease, partially offset by accretion expense, which accounted for a $5.4 million increase. Comparison of 2017 with 2016 Liquidity option expense increased $39.8 million in 2017 when compared to 2016 also due to the effect of changes in management estimates, which accounted for a $37.6 million increase, and accretion expense, which accounted for an additional $2.2 million increase. The unfavorable adjustment attributable to changes in management estimates was due to revising the valuation model to reflect applicable provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (i.e., the limitation of interest expense deductibility, partially offset by a lower federal corporate tax rate). Gain on step acquisition of unconsolidated affiliate We recognized a non-cash gain of $39.4 million during 2018 related to the step acquisition of Delaware Processing. For information regarding this acquisition, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Income taxes Provision for income taxes primarily reflects our state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (the “Texas Margin Tax”). We are not subject to federal income tax. Our provision for income taxes for 2018 increased $34.6 million when compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in taxable margin and the Texas apportionment factor. Our provision for income taxes for 2017 increased $2.3 million when compared to 2016. Business Segment Highlights We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. 78 Table of Contents The following table presents gross operating margin by segment and non-GAAP total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Gross operating margin by segment: NGL Pipelines & Services $ 3,830.7 $ 3,258.3 $ 2,990.6 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services 1,511.3 987.2 854.6 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 891.2 714.5 734.9 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services 1,057.8 714.6 650.6 Total segment gross operating margin (1) 7,291.0 5,674.6 5,230.7 Net adjustment for shipper make-up rights 34.7 5.8 17.1 Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 7,325.7 $ 5,680.4 $ 5,247.8 (1) Within the context of this table, total segment gross operating margin represents a subtotal and corresponds to measures similarly titled within our business segment disclosures found under Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Total gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Total gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of gross operating margin may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment gross operating margin for NGL Pipelines & Services and Crude Oil Pipelines & Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights that are included in management’s evaluation of segment results. However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total gross operating margin. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income. For a discussion of operating income and its components, see the previous section titled “Consolidated Income Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income to total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Operating income (GAAP) $ 5,408.6 $ 3,928.9 $ 3,580.7 Adjustments to reconcile operating income to total gross operating margin: Add depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses 1,687.0 1,531.3 1,456.7 Add asset impairment and related charges in operating costs and expenses 50.5 49.8 52.8 Subtract net gains attributable to asset sales in operating costs and expenses (28.7 ) (10.7 ) (2.5 ) Add general and administrative costs 208.3 181.1 160.1 Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 7,325.7 $ 5,680.4 $ 5,247.8 Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. Estimated Impact of Hurricane Harvey on Results for 2017 The Gulf Coast region of Texas, including its critical energy infrastructure, was impacted by the cumulative effects of Hurricane Harvey during the third quarter of 2017. Impacts on the energy industry included, but were not limited to, severe flooding and limited access to facilities, disruptions to energy demand from area refineries and petrochemical facilities and the closure of all ports on the Texas Gulf Coast, which limited access to export markets. Although operating at reduced rates, many of our plant, pipeline and storage assets along the Texas Gulf Coast remained operational during the storm. 79 Table of Contents We estimate that Hurricane Harvey reduced our gross operating margin for 2017 by $46 million. Of this amount, $30 million represents the combined net impact of lower-than-anticipated volumes and lost business opportunities. The remaining $16 million represents expenses we incurred in connection with hurricane-related repair and recovery costs. The following table summarizes the estimated reduction in gross operating margin by business segment for 2017 due to the hurricane (dollars in millions): Reduction in total gross operating margin by segment: Petrochemical & Refined Products Services $ 30.9 NGL Pipelines & Services 8.1 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services 6.0 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 1.0 Total estimated reduction due to the effects of Hurricane Harvey $ 46.0 NGL Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Segment gross operating margin: Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities $ 1,240.1 $ 911.2 $ 846.6 NGL pipelines, storage and terminals 2,048.3 1,821.0 1,625.4 NGL fractionation 542.3 526.1 518.6 Total $ 3,830.7 $ 3,258.3 $ 2,990.6 Selected volumetric data: NGL pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 3,461 3,168 2,965 NGL marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 593 516 436 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 945 831 828 Equity NGL production (MBPD) (1) 155 158 141 Fee-based natural gas processing (MMcf/d) (2) 4,831 4,572 4,736 (1) Represents the NGL volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities. (2) Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our natural gas processing plants. Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities Comparison of 2018 with 2017. Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2018 increased a net $328.9 million when compared to 2017. Gross operating margin from our Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco natural gas processing plants increased $135.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average processing margins, including the impact of our related hedging activities. On a combined net basis for these plants, fee-based natural gas processing volumes and equity NGL production increased 126 MMcf/d and decreased 6 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our South Texas natural gas processing plants increased a net $71.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average processing margins, including the impact of related hedging activities. Fee-based natural gas processing volumes for our South Texas gas plants decreased 130 MMcf/d year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Permian Basin natural gas processing plants increased a combined $60.8 million year-to-year primarily due to gross operating margin from our Orla gas plant, which commenced operations in May 2018 and generated $41.7 million of the increase, and our acquisition in March 2018 of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our Waha gas plant, which resulted in an incremental $27.9 million of gross operating margin from this plant following the acquisition date. Fee-based natural gas processing volumes and equity NGL production from our Permian Basin natural gas processing plants increased a combined net 273 MMcf/d and 5 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year. Of these amounts, fee-based natural gas processing volumes and equity NGL production at Orla represented 195 MMcf/d and 5 MBPD, respectively. 80 Table of Contents On a combined basis, gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants in Louisiana and Mississippi decreased a net $11.7 million year-to-year primarily due to a one-time $19.1 million benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with proceeds from a business interruption insurance claim at our Pascagoula gas plant, partially offset by higher combined equity NGL production volumes of 7 MBPD, which accounted for an $11.3 million increase. The Pascagoula gas plant experienced a fire in June 2016 and several months of resulting downtime. The plant was repaired and placed back into commercial service in December 2016. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased a net $73.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for a $236.7 million increase, partially offset by a $164.2 million decrease due to lower sales volumes. As noted previously, the main purpose of our marketing activities in each business segment is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network. Results from marketing strategies that optimize our transportation and plant assets increased $172.3 million and $28.9 million, respectively, year-to-year, partially offset by decreases in earnings related to the optimization of our storage and export assets, which accounted for $99.4 million and $48.7 million, respectively, of decreases year-to-year. In addition, gross operating margin from NGL marketing activities reflects $9.3 million of non-cash, mark-to-market gains for 2018 compared to non-cash, mark-to-market losses of $11.0 million for 2017. Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2017 increased a net $64.6 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants in Louisiana and Mississippi increased a combined $54.1 million year-to-year primarily due to (i) lower repair and operating costs, which accounted for $19.4 million of the increase and were mainly attributable to fire-related repairs completed at the Pascagoula plant in 2016, (ii) a one-time $19.1 million benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with proceeds from the business interruption insurance claim at our Pascagoula gas plant and (iii) higher average processing margins, which accounted for an additional $9.8 million increase. Fee-based natural gas processing volumes at our Louisiana and Mississippi plants increased a combined 138 MMcf/d year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco natural gas processing plants increased a net $31.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average processing margins, which accounted for $41.9 million of the increase and reflect the impact of hedging activities, partially offset by lower average processing fees, which accounted for a $7.3 million decrease. On a combined basis for these three plants, fee-based natural gas processing volumes and equity NGL production decreased 61 MMcf/d and increased 16 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities decreased a net $10.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average sales margins, which accounted for a $37.9 million decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $20.1 million increase, and lower railcar leasing costs, which accounted for an additional $7.4 million increase. Results from NGL marketing’s activities decreased $11.4 million year-to-year due to non-cash, mark-to-market activity. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing plants in South Texas decreased a net $9.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower fee-based processing volumes, which accounted for a $21.7 million decrease, higher maintenance costs, which accounted for an additional $7.3 million decrease, partially offset by higher average processing margins, which accounted for an $18.6 million increase including the impact of hedging activities. Lower producer drilling activity in South Texas in 2017 contributed to a 352 MMcf/d decrease in fee-based natural gas processing volumes for these plants. Gross operating margin from our Permian Basin natural gas processing plants increased $2.0 million year-to-year, primarily due to gross operating margin from our South Eddy gas plant, which commenced operations in May 2016 and generated $3.9 million of the increase. Fee-based natural gas processing volumes and equity NGL production for our Permian Basin natural gas processing plants increased a combined 73 MMcf/d and 3 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year. NGL pipelines, storage and terminals Comparison of 2018 with 2017.

Gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System and related terminals increased a net $9.1 million primarily due to (i) higher transportation volumes of 50 MBPD, which accounted for a $26.8 million increase, (ii) higher blending, terminal and offloading revenues, which accounted for a $13.5 million increase, partially offset by (iii) lower average transportation fees, which accounted for an $18.5 million decrease, and (iv) higher pipeline offloading costs paid to affiliate pipelines, which accounted for an additional $16.3 million decrease. Gross operating margin from our equity investment in the Texas Express Pipeline increased $15.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes of 15 MBPD (net to our interest) in 2018 attributable to contractual increases in committed shipper volumes and volumes offloaded from affiliate pipelines. Due to pipeline infrastructure constraints in the Permian Basin region, we have been using offloading arrangements to optimize available capacity on the Mid-American Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and Texas Express Pipelines to transport NGLs to our Mont Belvieu complex. Gross operating margin from our Appalachia-to-Texas Express, or “ATEX,” pipeline increased $45.6 million year-to-year primarily due to contractual increases in committed shipper volumes. NGL transportation volumes on ATEX increased 22 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our underground storage facilities at the Mont Belvieu hub and in south Louisiana increased a combined $43.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher storage fees. Gross operating margin from our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal increased $31.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher loading volumes of 56 MBPD. Likewise, gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel Pipeline System increased $8.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes, which accounted for $15.7 million of the increase, partially offset by higher maintenance and other operating costs, which accounted for a $7.1 million decrease. Transportation volumes along our Houston Ship Channel Pipeline System increased 84 MBPD, which in turn is attributable to shipments of ethane from Mont Belvieu to the Morgan’s Point export terminal. Gross operating margin from our Dixie Pipeline and related terminals decreased $10.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher costs attributable to periodic pipeline integrity testing. Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines, storage and terminal assets for 2017 increased a net $195.6 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from ATEX increased $57.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher walk-up shipper volumes and contractual increases in committed shipper volumes. NGL transportation volumes for ATEX increased 18 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal and Houston Ship Channel Pipeline System increased a combined $52.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher volumes. Ethane loading volumes at our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, which was placed into service in September 2016, increased 75 MBPD year-to-year. In addition, transportation volumes on our Houston Ship Channel Pipeline System increased 105 MBPD year-to-year primarily due to shipments of ethane from Mont Belvieu to the Morgan’s Point export terminal. Gross operating margin from our underground storage facility at the Mont Belvieu hub for NGLs and related products increased $50.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average storage fees in 2017. Gross operating margin from our Seminole, Chaparral and affiliated NGL pipelines increased a combined net $23.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average transportation fees, which accounted for a $15.9 million increase, and higher transportation volumes, which accounted for an additional $14.8 million increase, partially offset by higher operating costs of $6.6 million. On a combined basis, NGL transportation volumes on these pipelines increased 33 MBPD primarily due to increased production from natural gas processing plants located in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountains. 82 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our equity investments in the Texas Express Gathering System and the Texas Express Pipeline increased a combined $18.3 million year-to-year primarily due to contractual increases in committed shipper volumes.

Transportation volumes for the South Texas NGL Pipeline System decreased 21 MBPD year-to-year. NGL fractionation Comparison of 2018 with 2017. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2018 increased $16.2 million when compared to 2017. Gross operating margin from our Hobbs NGL fractionator increased $10.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher product blending revenues, which accounted for a $3.2 million increase, and lower maintenance and other operating costs, which accounted for an additional $4.5 million increase. NGL fractionation volumes increased 4 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation complex increased $7.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher fractionation volumes of 97 MBPD (net to our interest) resulting from the start-up of our ninth NGL fractionator in May 2018. The new fractionator, which is located in Chambers County, Texas, has a capacity of 90 MBPD, which increased total NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex to 760 MBPD. Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2017 increased a net $7.5 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation complex increased a net $4.1 million primarily due to higher average fractionation fees and blending revenues, which accounted for a $50.8 million increase, partially offset by higher storage, maintenance and power expenses of $47.3 million.

Crude Oil Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Segment gross operating margin: Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System and related business activities, excluding associated non-cash mark-to-market results $ 349.3 $ 45.8 Mark-to-market loss attributable to the Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System (44.6 ) (20.5 ) Total Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System and related business activities 304.7 25.3 Other crude oil pipelines, terminals and related marketing results 1,206.6 961.9 $ 854.6 Total $ 1,511.3 $ 987.2 $ 854.6 Selected volumetric data: Crude oil pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 2,000 1,820 1,388 Crude oil marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 684 531 495 Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System and related business activities Gross operating margin from our Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System and related business activities was a combined $304.7 million for 2018 compared to a combined $25.3 million in 2017. Transportation volumes for the Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System, which entered limited service in November 2017 and full service in April 2018, averaged 437 MBPD and 333 MBPD during 2018 and 2017, respectively (net to our interest). Gross operating margin for this business for 2018 reflects a non-cash mark-to-market loss of $44.6 million associated with the hedging of crude oil market price differentials (basis spreads) between the Midland and Houston area markets. 83 Table of Contents These hedges, which were primarily entered into during 2017, serve to lock in a positive margin on our anticipated purchases of crude oil at Midland and subsequent anticipated sales to customers in the Houston area for periods extending predominantly into 2019 and minimally through 2020. At December 31, 2018, these hedges represented a weighted average of approximately 22% of the pipeline’s expected uncommitted capacity through 2020 at an average positive margin of $2.76 per barrel. The mark-to-market loss reflects a widening of the basis spread between the Midland and Houston markets to an average of $8.48 per barrel through 2020 relative to our average hedged amount of $2.76 per barrel across these same periods (as of December 31, 2018). Basis swaps, in all but very limited circumstances, do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting despite being highly effective at hedging the price risk inherent in the underlying physical transactions. The volume hedged through 2020 varies from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year; however, the hedge levels generally correspond to pipeline capacity currently expected to be available to us during the first three years of the pipeline’s operations as customer commitment volumes ramp up to peak levels. If the basis spreads underlying these hedges widen from the levels at December 31, 2018, we would be exposed to additional temporary non-cash mark-to-market losses. Conversely, if basis spreads narrow in the future reverting back towards or below the average $2.76 per barrel spread we have locked in at December 31, 2018, then we would recognize temporary non-cash mark-to-market gains in future periods. When the forecasted physical receipts and deliveries of crude oil ultimately occur in the future, we will realize a physical gross margin at then prevailing commodity price spreads; however the realized settlement of the associated financial hedges would convert that physical margin to the average $2.76 per barrel spread of the financial hedges. At that time, the unrealized mark-to-market loss recognized for 2018 and in future periods until the physical deliveries occur will be reversed, thus eliminating their impact to cumulative earnings recognized over the entire life-to-date period of the hedge. The basis spread between the Midland and Houston markets continues to fluctuate. We also have uncommitted capacity on the pipeline that could provide us with potential upside to widening or downside to narrowing market spreads. For information regarding our crude oil marketing hedging portfolio, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Gross operating margin for 2018 was also reduced by $33.9 million in connection with the allocation of pipeline earnings to Western upon closing of their acquisition of a noncontrolling 20% equity interest in the pipeline on June 1, 2018. Other crude oil pipelines, terminals and related marketing results Comparison of 2018 with 2017. Gross operating margin from our other crude oil pipelines, terminals and related marketing activities for 2018 increased a net $244.7 million when compared to 2017. Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System increased a net $71.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher firm capacity reservation fees, which accounted for $43.3 million of the increase, and higher deficiency fee revenues associated with producer volume commitments, which accounted for a $22.9 million increase. The increase in firm capacity reservation fees is attributable to use of the Rancho II pipeline by the Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System. Crude oil transportation volumes for the South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System decreased 5 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from crude oil export activities at EHT increased $49.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher net loading volumes, which increased 152 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Midland and ECHO terminals increased a combined $24.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher throughput volumes attributable to movements on the Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System. Gross operating margin from our West Texas System and equity investment in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System increased a combined $44.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes, which increased 85 MBPD (net to our interest). 84 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our EFS Midstream System increased $23.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher deficiency fee revenues. Condensate and natural gas transportation volumes for this system decreased 2 MBPD and 39 MMcf/d, respectively, year-to-year. Although gross operating margin for this system decreased $15.9 million year-to-year attributable to lower throughput volumes, the decrease was more than offset by a $34.3 million year-to-year increase in deficiency fee revenues associated with producer volume commitments. These volume commitments begin to expire in mid-2022. Based on our forecast of drilling activity in the region served by the EFS Midstream System, we expect that production volumes will increase in the coming years, thus offsetting the decline in contractual producer volume commitments. Gross operating margin from our equity investment in the Seaway Pipeline decreased $16.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average transportation fees attributable to an increase in walk-up shipper volumes, which are charged a lower tariff. Transportation volumes for Seaway decreased 9 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our related crude oil marketing activities increased a net $55.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for a $69.2 million increase, partially offset by lower non-cash mark-to-market results, which accounted for a $15.2 million decrease. Non-cash mark-to-market earnings for this business was a gain of $0.5 million for 2018 versus a gain of $15.7 million for 2017. Average sales margins increased in 2018 primarily due to higher market price differentials for crude oil between the Permian Basin region, Cushing hub and Gulf Coast markets. As crude oil production in the Permian Basin region increased in 2018, pipeline infrastructure constraints led to pricing dislocations in the supply basins (lower crude oil prices in West Texas) compared to the prices paid by end users and exporters along the Gulf Coast. As midstream infrastructure constraints are alleviated in the coming years, we expect that these market price differentials will normalize. Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from our other crude oil pipelines, terminals and related marketing activities for 2017 increased a net $107.3 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from our West Texas System and equity investment in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System increased a combined $54.7 million year-to-year primarily due to an 89 MBPD increase in crude oil transportation volumes (net to our interest).

Condensate transportation volumes for this system decreased 18 MBPD year-to-year and associated natural gas volumes decreased 101 MMcf/d year-to-year. Gross operating margin for the system decreased $59.7 million year-to-year primarily due to the lower throughput volumes; however, this decrease was more than offset by a $98.1 million year-to-year increase in deficiency fee revenues associated with producer volume commitments. Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System increased $25.0 million primarily due to higher firm capacity reservation fees, which accounted for a $17.1 million increase and was attributable to use of the Rancho II pipeline by the Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System. Crude oil transportation volumes for the South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System decreased 9 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our related crude oil marketing activities decreased a net $5.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average sales margins, which accounted for a $39.0 million decrease, lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $38.2 million decrease, partially offset by a $56.1 million benefit related to non-cash mark-to-market results, lower pipeline-related costs, which accounted for a $7.8 million increase, and higher earnings from trucking activities, which accounted for an additional $7.5 million increase. Non-cash mark-to-market earnings for this business was a gain of $15.7 million for 2017 versus a loss of $40.4 million for 2016. 85 Table of Contents Natural Gas Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Segment gross operating margin $ 891.2 $ 714.5 $ 734.9 Selected volumetric data: Natural gas pipeline transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 13,727 12,305 11,874 Comparison of 2018 with 2017. Gross operating margin from our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for 2018 increased a net $176.7 million when compared to 2017. Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System increased $75.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average firm capacity reservation fees, which accounted for a $62.6 million increase, and higher average transportation fees, which accounted for an additional $19.3 million increase, partially offset by higher maintenance and other operating costs, which accounted for a $14.8 million decrease. Due to market price differentials for natural gas between the Permian Basin region and Gulf Coast markets, shippers were willing to pay higher prices for firm capacity and spot transportation arrangements in 2018. Natural gas transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System increased 119 BBtus/d year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities increased $41.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for a $23.5 million increase, and higher non-cash mark-to-market earnings, which accounted for an additional $13.2 million increase. Average sales margins increased in 2018 primarily due to higher market price differentials for natural gas between the Permian Basin region and Gulf Coast markets. As crude oil and associated natural gas production in the Permian Basin region increased in 2018, pipeline infrastructure constraints led to pricing dislocations in the supply basins (lower natural gas prices in West Texas) compared to the prices paid by end users and exporters along the Gulf Coast. As midstream infrastructure constraints are alleviated in the coming years, we expect that these market price differentials will normalize. Gross operating margin from our Haynesville Gathering System increased a net $26.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher gathering volumes, which accounted for a $16.8 million increase, higher treating and other fee revenues, which accounted for an additional $14.1 million increase, partially offset by higher maintenance and other operating costs, which accounted for a $4.7 million decrease. Natural gas gathering volumes on the Haynesville Gathering System increased 318 BBtus/d due to prolific production from the Haynesville Shale region. Gross operating margin from our Acadian Gas System decreased a net $11.7 million year-to-year primarily due to a $17.4 million benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2017 for proceeds we received in a legal settlement for lost revenues and damages associated with the Bayou Corne sinkhole incident caused by third parties in 2012, partially offset by higher average firm capacity reservation fees on the Haynesville Extension pipeline, which accounted for an $11.0 million increase. Transportation volumes for the Acadian Gas System increased 420 BBtus/d year-to-year, with the Haynesville Extension pipeline accounting for 379 BBtus/d of the increase. Gross operating margin from our Permian Basin Gathering System increased $21.3 million year-to-year primarily due to a 287 BBtus/d increase in natural gas gathering volumes, which accounted for a $28.5 million increase, partially offset by higher costs at our Waha facility during the fourth quarter of 2018, which accounted for a $6.1 million decrease. Natural gas production in the Permian Basin region continues to rise as a result of the significant increases in crude oil production across West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. Gross operating margin from our BTA Gathering System, which we acquired in April 2017, increased $14.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher gathering volumes of 91 BBtus/d. Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for 2017 decreased a net $20.4 million when compared to 2016. 86 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System decreased $51.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower firm capacity reservation fees, which accounted for a $30.1 million decrease, lower natural gas transportation volumes, which accounted for an $8.5 million decrease, lower average transportation fees, which accounted for a $7.1 million decrease, and increased operating costs, which accounted for an additional $3.4 million decrease. The $30.1 million decrease in firm capacity reservation fees in 2017 is primarily due to the settlement of a customer contract in the fourth quarter of 2016. Natural gas transportation volumes for the Texas Intrastate System decreased 324 BBtus/d year-to-year primarily due to reduced producer activity in the Eagle Ford and Barnett Shale areas in 2017.

Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2018 increased a net $40.2 million when compared to 2017. Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline increased $34.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average transportation and other fees, which accounted for a combined $19.6 million increase, and higher transportation volumes, which accounted for an additional $18.2 million increase. Transportation volumes on the TE Products Pipeline increased a net 6 MBPD year-to-year primarily due to higher NGL transportation volumes of 14 MBPD, partially offset by lower petrochemical transportation volumes of 8 MBPD. Gross operating margin from our refined products marketing activities increased $14.3 million primarily due to higher average refined products sales margins. Gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel refined products marine terminal decreased $6.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower storage revenues. Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2017 decreased a net $25.5 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from refined products marketing decreased a net $18.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average refined products sales margins, which accounted for a $30.0 million decrease, partially offset by a $12.0 million year-to-year increase in non-cash mark-to-market income. Gross operating margin from our Beaumont and Houston Ship Channel refined products marine terminals decreased a combined $14.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating costs. Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline increased a net $7.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average transportation fees, which accounted for a $10.8 million increase, partially offset by lower transportation volumes, which accounted for a $5.8 million decrease. Transportation volumes for the TE Products Pipeline decreased 24 MBPD primarily due to lower movements of refined products and petrochemicals during 2017. Marine transportation Comparison of 2018 with 2017. Gross operating margin from marine transportation for 2018 increased $10.2 million when compared to 2017 primarily due to higher marine vessel utilization rates year-to-year. Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from marine transportation for 2017 decreased $21.5 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to lower average fees. Liquidity and Capital Resources Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. At December 31, 2018, we had $6.34 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $6.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $344.8 million of unrestricted cash on hand. We have a universal shelf registration statement (the “2016 Shelf”) on file with the SEC which allows Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and EPO (each on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. EPO issued $5.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and junior subordinated notes using the 2016 Shelf during the year ended December 31, 2018. The 2016 Shelf will expire in May 2019, and we expect to file a replacement universal shelf registration statement at or before such time. We may issue additional equity and debt securities in the future to assist us in meeting our funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital investments. 89 Table of Contents Consolidated Debt The following table presents scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2018 for the years indicated (dollars in millions): Scheduled Maturities of Debt Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Senior Notes $ 23,750.0 $ 1,500.0 $ 1,500.0 $ 1,325.0 $ 1,400.0 $ 1,250.0 $ 16,775.0 Junior Subordinated Notes 2,670.6 -- -- -- -- -- 2,670.6 Total $ 26,420.6 $ 1,500.0 $ 1,500.0 $ 1,325.0 $ 1,400.0 $ 1,250.0 $ 19,445.6 For additional information regarding our debt agreements, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Issuance of $3.0 Billion of Senior Notes in October 2018 In October 2018, EPO issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $750 million principal amount of senior notes due February 2022 (“Senior Notes VV”), (ii) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due October 2028 (“Senior Notes WW”) and (iii) $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes due February 2049 (“Senior Notes XX”). Net proceeds from this offering were used by EPO for the temporary repayment of amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program and general company purposes, including for growth capital expenditures. Senior Notes VV were issued at 99.985% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 3.50% per year. Senior Notes WW were issued at 99.764% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 4.15% per year. Senior Notes XX were issued at 99.390% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 4.80% per year. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has guaranteed the senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis. Issuance of $2.0 Billion of Senior Notes and $700 Million of Junior Subordinated Notes in February 2018 In February 2018, EPO issued $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of notes comprised of (i) $750 million principal amount of senior notes due February 2021 (“Senior Notes TT”), (ii) $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes due February 2048 (“Senior Notes UU”) and (iii) $700 million principal amount of junior subordinated notes due February 2078 (“Junior Subordinated Notes F”). Net proceeds from these offerings were used by EPO for the temporary repayment of amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program, general company purposes, and the redemption of all $682.7 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its Junior Subordinated Notes B. Senior Notes TT were issued at 99.946% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 2.80% per year. Senior Notes UU were issued at 99.865% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 4.25% per year. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has guaranteed the senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis. The Junior Subordinated Notes F are redeemable at EPO’s option, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, on or after February 15, 2028 at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.375% per year through February 14, 2028. Beginning February 15, 2028, the Junior Subordinated Notes F will bear interest at a floating rate based on a three-month LIBOR plus 2.57%, reset quarterly. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has guaranteed the Junior Subordinated Notes F through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and subordinated basis. Redemption of Junior Subordinated Notes In March 2018, EPO redeemed all of the $682.7 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its Junior Subordinated Notes B at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. This redemption was funded by EPO’s issuance of senior notes and junior subordinated notes in February 2018. 90 Table of Contents In August 2018, EPO redeemed all of the $521.1 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its Junior Subordinated Notes A at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. This redemption was funded by the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program. 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement In September 2018, EPO entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement that replaced its prior 364-day credit facility. The new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures in September 2019. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement. Under the terms of the new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $2.0 billion (which may be increased by up to $200 million to $2.2 billion at EPO’s election, provided certain conditions are met) at a variable interest rate for a term of up to 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. To the extent that principal amounts are outstanding at the maturity date, EPO may elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as a non-revolving term loan for a period of one additional year, payable in September 2020. Borrowings under this revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general company purposes. The new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants (affirmative and negative) and events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity date of any amounts borrowed under this credit agreement. The credit agreement also restricts EPO’s ability to pay cash distributions to its parent, Enterprise Products Partners L.P., if an event of default (as defined in the credit agreement) has occurred and is continuing at the time such distribution is scheduled to be paid or would result therefrom. EPO’s obligations under the new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement are not secured by any collateral; however, they are guaranteed by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Increase in Amount Authorized under Commercial Paper Program In June 2018, EPO increased the aggregate principal amount of short-term notes that it could issue (and have outstanding at any time) under its commercial paper program from $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion. The commercial paper program enables us to access typically lower short-term interest rates, which allows us to manage working capital and our overall cost of capital. As a back-stop to the commercial paper program, we intend to maintain a minimum available borrowing capacity under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility equal to the outstanding aggregate principal amount of EPO’s commercial paper notes. All commercial paper notes issued under the program are senior unsecured obligations of EPO that are unconditionally guaranteed by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. At December 31, 2018, we had no commercial paper notes outstanding. Credit Ratings At March 1, 2019, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s, Baa1 from Moody’s and BBB+ from Fitch Ratings. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO’s short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor’s, P-2 from Moody’s and F-2 from Fitch Ratings. EPO’s credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. Common Unit Buyback Program In December 1998, we announced a common unit buyback program whereby we, together with certain affiliates, could repurchase up to 4,000,000 of our common units on the open market. We purchased the remaining authorized amount of 1,236,800 common units in late December 2018 for $30.8 million at an average price of $24.92 per unit. 91 Table of Contents In January 2019, we announced that the Board of Enterprise GP had approved a $2.0 billion multi-year common unit buyback program, which provides the partnership with an additional method to return capital to investors. See “Significant Recent Developments” within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information. Issuance of Common Units The following table summarizes the issuance of common units in connection with our at-the-market (“ATM”) program, distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) and employee unit purchase plan (“EUPP”) for the years indicated (dollars in millions, number of units issued as shown): Number of Common Units Issued Net Cash Proceeds Received Year Ended December 31, 2016: Common units issued in connection with ATM program 87,867,037 $ 2,156.1 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 16,316,534 386.7 Total 104,183,571 $ 2,542.8 Year Ended December 31, 2017: Common units issued in connection with ATM program 21,807,726 $ 597.0 Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 19,046,019 476.4 Total 40,853,745 $ 1,073.4 Year Ended December 31, 2018: Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP (1) 19,861,951 $ 538.4 (1) The net cash proceeds we received from the issuance of common units during 2018 were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under EPO’s commercial paper program and for general company purposes. ATM Program We have a registration statement on file with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $2.54 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings in connection with our ATM program. Pursuant to this program, we may sell common units from time-to-time under an equity distribution agreement between Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and certain broker-dealers by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement. After taking into account the aggregate sales price of common units sold under the ATM program through December 31, 2018, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under the ATM program up to an aggregate sales price of $2.54 billion. We did not issue any common units under the ATM program during the year ended December 31, 2018. DRIP and EUPP We have a registration statement on file with the SEC in connection with our DRIP. The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional common units at a discount ranging from 0% to 5%. Beginning with the distribution declared with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017 and paid in February 2018, the discount was reduced from 5% to 2.5%. Likewise, beginning with the distribution declared with respect to the fourth quarter of 2018 and paid in February 2019, the discount was reduced from 2.5% to 0%. We have the sole discretion to determine whether common units purchased under the DRIP will come from our authorized but unissued common units or from common units purchased on the open market by the DRIP administrator. We issued 19,316,781 new common units, which generated net cash proceeds of $523.3 million, under the DRIP in 2018. After taking into account the number of common units issued under the DRIP through December 31, 2018, we have the capacity to deliver an additional 61,400,359 common units under this plan. 92 Table of Contents In addition to the DRIP, we have registration statements on file with the SEC in connection with our EUPP. We issued 545,170 new common units, which generated net cash proceeds of $15.1 million, under the EUPP in 2018. After taking into account the number of common units issued under the EUPP through December 31, 2018, we have the capacity to deliver an additional 5,215,641 common units under this plan. For additional information regarding our consolidated equity, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Cash Flow Statement Highlights The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 6,126.3 $ 4,666.3 $ 4,066.8 Cash used in investing activities 4,281.6 3,286.1 4,005.8 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,504.9 ) (1,727.5 ) 321.7 Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. Changes in energy commodity prices may impact the demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemical and refined products, which could impact sales of our products and the demand for our midstream services. Changes in demand for our products and services may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels. We may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their obligations to us in connection with our marketing activities and long-term take-or-pay agreements. Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a major consideration in our businesses, and our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to sufficiently eliminate customer credit risk. We manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions may utilize letters of credit, prepayments, net out agreements and guarantees. However, these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk. We have a concentration of trade receivable balances due from independent and major integrated oil and gas companies and other pipelines and wholesalers. These concentrations may affect our overall credit risk in that these energy industry customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts: Operating activities Comparison of 2018 with 2017. Net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2018 increased $1.46 billion when compared to 2017. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: § a $1.43 billion increase in cash resulting from higher partnership earnings in 2018 compared to 2017 (after adjusting our $1.38 billion year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); and § a $45.7 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to our investments in NGL pipeline businesses. For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see “Results of Operations” within this Part II, Item 7. 93 Table of Contents Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2017 increased $599.5 million when compared to 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: § a $333.2 million increase in cash resulting from higher partnership earnings in 2017 compared to 2016 (after adjusting our $302.6 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); § a $213.1 million year-to-year increase in cash primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations; and § a $53.2 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to our investments in crude oil pipeline businesses. Investing activities Comparison of 2018 with 2017. Cash used for investing activities in 2018 increased $995.5 million when compared to 2017 primarily due to: § a $1.12 billion year-to-year increase in expenditures for consolidated property, plant and equipment (see “Capital Investments” within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information); and § a $63.1 million year-to-year increase in investments in unconsolidated affiliates primarily related to NGL and crude oil pipeline projects; partially offset by § a $121.1 million year-to-year increase in proceeds from assets sales primarily due to the sale of our former Red River System in October 2018 for $134.9 million; and § a $48.1 million year-to-year decrease in net cash used for business combinations. We used $150.6 million in 2018 to acquire the remaining 50% equity interest in Delaware Processing. For 2017, we used $191.4 million to acquire the BTA Gathering System and related assets. Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Cash used for investing activities in 2017 decreased $719.7 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to: § an $801.3 million year-to-year decrease in cash used for business combinations, net of cash received. In 2017, net cash used for business combinations was $198.7 million, which was primarily attributable to our acquisition of the BTA Gathering System and related assets. In 2016, we paid the second and final installment for the acquisition of the EFS Midstream System; and § an $88.3 million year-to-year decrease in investments in unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to the completion of various NGL and crude oil projects; partially offset by § a $117.7 million year-to-year increase in expenditures for consolidated property, plant and equipment. Financing activities Comparison of 2018 with 2017. Cash used in financing activities for 2018 decreased $222.6 million when compared to 2017 primarily due to: § a $775.9 million year-to-year increase in net cash inflows attributable to our consolidated debt obligations. EPO issued $5.7 billion and repaid or redeemed $2.3 billion in principal amount of senior and junior subordinated notes during 2018 compared to the issuance of $1.7 billion in principal amount of junior subordinated notes and the repayment of $800.0 million in principal amount of senior notes during 2017. In addition, net repayments of short term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program increased $1.71 billion year-to-year; and 94 Table of Contents § a $237.7 million year-to-year increase in contributions from noncontrolling interests. In June 2018, Western acquired a noncontrolling 20% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns the Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System for $189.6 million in cash. In addition, during 2018 we received $41.0 million of contributions for the construction of our jointly-owned ethylene export facility; partially offset by § a $535.0 million year-to-year decrease in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units. We issued an aggregate 19,861,951 common units, which generated $538.4 million of net cash proceeds, in connection with our DRIP and EUPP during 2018. This compares to an aggregate 40,853,745 common units we issued in connection with our ATM, DRIP and EUPP during 2017, which collectively generated $1.07 billion of net cash proceeds; § a $157.0 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners during 2018 when compared to 2017. The increase in cash distributions is due to increases in both the number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the quarterly cash distribution rates per unit; § a $32.4 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to noncontrolling interests primarily related to the Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System; and § a $30.8 million repurchase of common units under a legacy buyback program in December 2018. Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Cash used in financing activities for 2017 was $1.73 billion compared to cash provided by financing activities of $321.7 million for 2016. The $2.05 billion year-to-year change in cash flow from financing activities was primarily due to: § a $1.47 billion year-to-year decrease in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units. We issued an aggregate 40,853,745 common units, which generated $1.07 billion of net cash proceeds, in connection with our ATM program, DRIP and EUPP during 2017. This compares to an aggregate 104,183,571 common units we issued in connection with these programs and plans during 2016, which collectively generated $2.54 billion of net cash proceeds; § a $285.6 million year-to-year decrease in net cash inflows attributable to our consolidated debt obligations. EPO issued $1.7 billion in principal amount of junior subordinated notes and repaid $800.0 million in principal amount of senior notes during 2017 compared to the issuance of $1.25 billion and repayment of $750.0 million in principal amount of senior notes during 2016. In addition, net repayments under EPO’s commercial paper program were $44.2 million during 2017 compared to net issuances of $647.9 million during 2016; and § a $269.4 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners during 2017 when compared to 2016. Restricted Cash Restricted cash represents amounts held in segregated bank accounts by our clearing brokers as margin in support of our commodity derivative instruments portfolio and related physical purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and refined products. Additional cash may be restricted to maintain our commodity derivative instruments portfolio as prices fluctuate or margin requirements change. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our restricted cash amounts were $65.3 million and $65.2 million, respectively. For information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. In addition, see Part II, Item 7A of this annual report. 95 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures Distributable Cash Flow Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business, including those for capital expenditures, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash by the partnership allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets. In January 2019, the Board declared a cash distribution of $0.4350 per common unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, our management announced plans to recommend to the Board additional quarterly cash distribution increases of $0.0025 per unit with respect to each of the four quarters of 2019. For additional information regarding our expected distribution growth rate, see “Significant Recent Developments” within this Item 7. We measure available cash by reference to distributable cash flow (“DCF”), which is a non-GAAP cash flow measure. DCF is an important financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain our declared quarterly cash distributions. DCF is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships since the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Our management compares the DCF we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our distribution coverage ratio was approximately 1.6 times when compared to the sum of our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to fiscal 2018. Our calculation of DCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Based on the level of available cash each quarter, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board of Enterprise GP, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Unlike several other master limited partnerships, our general partner has a non-economic ownership interest in us and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from us based on incentive distribution rights or other equity interests. Our use of DCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. For a discussion of net cash flows provided by operating activities, see “Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities” within this Part II, Item 7. 96 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our calculation of DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net income attributable to limited partners (GAAP) (1) $ 4,172.4 $ 2,799.3 $ 2,513.1 Adjustments to GAAP net income attributable to limited partners to derive non-GAAP DCF: Add non-cash depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 1,791.6 1,644.0 1,552.0 Add non-cash asset impairment and related charges 50.5 49.8 53.5 Add non-cash expense or subtract benefit attributable to unrealized changes in fair value of derivative instruments 17.8 22.8 45.0 Add non-cash expense attributable to Liquidity Option Agreement 56.1 64.3 24.5 Subtract non-cash gain on step acquisition of unconsolidated affiliate (39.4 ) -- -- Add cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates (2) 529.4 483.0 451.5 Subtract equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates (480.0 ) (426.0 ) (362.0 ) Subtract net gains attributable to asset sales (28.7 ) (10.7 ) (2.5 ) Add deferred income tax expense 21.4 6.1 6.6 Subtract sustaining capital expenditures (3) (320.9 ) (243.9 ) (252.0 ) Other miscellaneous adjustments, net 35.9 42.9 20.5 Subtotal DCF, before proceeds from asset sales and monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges $ 5,806.1 $ 4,431.6 $ 4,050.2 Add cash proceeds from asset sales 161.2 40.1 46.5 Add cash proceeds from monetization of interest rate derivative instruments (4) 22.1 30.6 6.1 Distributable cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 5,989.4 $ 4,502.3 $ 4,102.8 Total cash distributions paid to limited partners with respect to period $ 3,777.1 $ 3,635.2 $ 3,394.0 Cash distributions per unit declared by Enterprise GP with respect to period (5) $ 1.7250 $ 1.6825 $ 1.6100 Total distributable cash flow retained by partnership with respect to period (6) $ 2,213.3 $ 867.1 $ 708.8 Distribution coverage ratio (7) 1.6x 1.2x 1.2x (1) For a discussion of significant changes in our comparative income statement amounts underlying net income attributable to limited partners, along with the primary drivers of such changes, see “Income Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. (2) Reflects both distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates and those attributable to a return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures include cash payments and accruals applicable to the period. (4) For information regarding these gains, see “Interest Rate Hedging Activities” under Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (5) See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to the years indicated. (6) At the sole discretion of Enterprise GP, cash retained by the partnership with respect to each of these years was primarily reinvested in growth capital projects. This retainage of cash substantially reduced our reliance on the equity capital markets to fund such expenditures. (7) Distribution coverage ratio is determined by dividing distributable cash flow by total cash distributions paid to limited partners and in connection with distribution equivalent rights with respect to the period The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by operating activities to DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 6,126.3 $ 4,666.3 $ 4,066.8 Adjustments to reconcile GAAP net cash flows provided by operating activities to non-GAAP DCF: Subtract sustaining capital expenditures (320.9 ) (243.9 ) (252.0 ) Add cash proceeds from asset sales 161.2 40.1 46.5 Add cash proceeds from monetization of interest rate derivative instruments 22.1 30.6 6.1 Net effect of changes in operating accounts (16.2 ) (32.2 ) 180.9 Other miscellaneous adjustments, net 16.9 41.4 54.5 Distributable cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 5,989.4 $ 4,502.3 $ 4,102.8 97 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Beginning with this annual report, we provide below the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow (“FCF”). FCF is a traditional cash flow metric that is widely used by a variety of investors and other participants in the financial community, as opposed to DCF, which is a cash flow measure primarily used by investors and others in evaluating master limited partnerships. In general, FCF is a measure of how much cash flow a business generates during a specified time period after accounting for all capital investments, including expenditures for growth and sustaining capital projects. By comparison, only sustaining capital expenditures are reflected in DCF. We believe that FCF is important to traditional investors since it reflects the amount of cash available for reducing debt, investing in additional capital projects, paying distributions, common unit repurchases and similar matters. Since business partners fund certain capital projects of our consolidated subsidiaries, our determination of FCF reflects the amount of cash we receive from noncontrolling interests, net of any distributions paid to such interests. Our calculation of FCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of FCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. The following table summarizes our calculation of FCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 6,126.3 $ 4,666.3 $ 4,066.8 Adjustments to GAAP net cash flows provided by operating activities to derive non-GAAP Free Cash Flow: Subtract cash used in investing activities (4,281.6 ) (3,286.1 ) (4,005.8 ) Add cash contributions from noncontrolling interests 238.1 0.4 20.4 Subtract cash distributions paid to noncontrolling interests (81.6 ) (49.2 ) (47.4 ) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 2,001.2 $ 1,331.4 $ 34.0 The elements used in calculating FCF are sourced directly from our statements of consolidated cash flows presented under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For a discussion of significant year-to-year changes in our cash flow statement amounts, see “Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities” within this Part II, Item 7. Capital Investments An important part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations, asset acquisitions, and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to expand our network of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production resulting from development activities in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and other domestic shale plays. Although our focus in recent years has been on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, asset acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. We placed $1.9 billion of major growth capital projects into service during 2018, including our PDH facility, two processing trains at our Orla natural gas processing plant (Orla I and II), and a ninth NGL fractionator located in Chambers County, Texas. We currently have $6.7 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2020 including: § the completion of joint venture-owned dock infrastructure in Corpus Christi designed to accommodate crude oil volumes (second quarter of 2019), § the Shin Oak NGL pipeline (first quarter of 2019 through fourth quarter of 2019), § the third processing train at our Orla natural gas processing facility (second quarter of 2019), § expansion of our Front Range and Texas Express NGL pipelines (third quarter of 2019), 98 Table of Contents § our iBDH facility (fourth quarter of 2019), § our ethylene export terminal (fourth quarter of 2019 through the fourth quarter of 2020), § our Mentone cryogenic natural gas processing plant (first quarter of 2020), and § a new NGL fractionation facility in Chambers County, Texas (fourth quarter of 2019 through the first half of 2020). Based on information currently available, we expect our total capital investments for 2019 to approximate $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion, which reflects growth capital expenditures of $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion and $350 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our forecast of capital investments for 2019 is based on our announced strategic operating and growth plans (through the filing date of this annual report), which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital investments due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather related issues and changes in supplier prices. Furthermore, our forecast of capital investments may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include unforeseen acquisition opportunities. Our success in raising capital, including partnering with other companies to share costs and risks, continues to be a significant factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we expect to make the forecast capital expenditures noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions. The following table summarizes our capital investments for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Capital investments for property, plant and equipment: (1) Growth capital projects (2) $ 3,902.3 $ 2,868.8 $ 2,722.7 Sustaining capital projects (3) 320.9 233.0 261.4 Total $ 4,223.2 $ 3,101.8 $ 2,984.1 Cash used for business combinations $ 150.6 $ 198.7 $ 1,000.0 Investments in unconsolidated affiliates $ 113.6 $ 50.5 $ 138.8 (1) Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented on a cash basis. (2) Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. Fluctuations in our expenditures for growth capital projects and investments in unconsolidated affiliates are explained in large part by increases or decreases in spending on major expansion projects. Our most significant growth capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 involved projects at our Mont Belvieu complex, Houston and Beaumont terminals, as well as projects to support crude oil, natural gas and NGL production from the Permian Basin. Fluctuations in expenditures for sustaining capital projects are explained in large part by the timing and cost of pipeline integrity and similar projects. Comparison of 2018 with 2017 Investments in growth capital projects supporting Permian Basin production increased $773.0 million year-to-year primarily due to increased expenditures for (i) the Shin Oak NGL Pipeline, which accounted for $839.1 million of the increase, (ii) conversion of a portion of our Seminole NGL Pipeline system to crude oil service (the Midland-to-ECHO 2 Pipeline System), which accounted for an additional $223.4 million increase, partially offset by (iii) a $520.1 million 99 Table of Contents decrease in investment related to our Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System, which commenced limited service in November 2017 and full service in April 2018. Investments in growth capital projects to expand and support export activities at EHT increased $161.9 million year-to-year. Additionally, investments in projects that expand our refined products handling capabilities at the Beaumont marine terminal increased $93.9 million year-to-year. Investments in growth capital projects at our Mont Belvieu complex decreased a net $168.6 million year-to-year, primarily due to decreased expenditures of $529.3 million for our PDH facility and ninth NGL fractionator, which were both placed into commercial service during the second quarter of 2018, partially offset by increased expenditures on our iBDH unit, which accounted for a $224.1 million increase, and our new NGL fractionation facility, which accounted for an additional $123.6 million increase. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates increased $63.1 million year-to-year primarily due to increased expenditures for certain NGL and crude oil expansion projects. Net cash used for business combinations decreased $48.1 million year-to-year. We invested $150.6 million in 2018 to acquire the remaining 50% equity interest in Delaware Processing compared to $191.4 million in 2017 to acquire the BTA Gathering System and related assets. Comparison of 2017 with 2016 Investments in growth capital projects supporting Permian Basin production increased $909.5 million year-to-year primarily due to increased expenditures for the Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline System, which accounted for a $480.2 million increase, construction activities at our Orla natural gas processing plant and related infrastructure, which accounted for an additional $422.1 million increase, partially offset by decreased expenditures on our South Eddy natural gas processing plant and related pipelines, which accounted for a $131.2 million decrease. We completed construction and placed the South Eddy plant into service in May 2016. Investments in our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal and our LPG export expansion project at EHT decreased a combined $299.3 million. Our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal was placed into service in September 2016. Investments in growth capital projects at our Mont Belvieu complex decreased $271.9 million year-to-year, primarily due to decreased expenditures at our PDH facility, which accounted for a $443.8 million decrease, partially offset by increased expenditures on our ninth NGL fractionator, which accounted for a $141.9 million increase, and our iBDH unit, which accounted for an additional $93.2 million increase. Investments in our ECHO and Beaumont Marine West crude oil terminals decreased a combined $103.7 million year-to-year as new storage tanks and related assets were placed into service at these facilities during 2016. Net cash used for business combinations decreased $801.3 million year-to-year due to the second and final payment of $1.0 billion made in July 2016 for the EFS Midstream System, partially offset by $191.4 million in net cash paid in connection with the acquisition of the BTA Gathering System and related assets in April 2017. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates decreased $88.3 million year-to-year primarily due to the completion of certain NGL and crude oil expansion projects. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following sections discuss the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies: 100 Table of Contents Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Depreciation expense incorporates management estimates regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets into service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected residual values or (iv) significant changes in our forecast of the remaining life for the associated resource basins, if applicable. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $38.74 billion and $35.62 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.44 billion, $1.30 billion and $1.22 billion of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable through future cash flows. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals or refined products. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated residual values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset’s estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include the usage of probabilities when there is a range of possible outcomes. An equity method investment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible permanent loss in value of the investment (i.e., an “other than a temporary” decline). Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee’s industry. When evidence of a loss in value has occurred, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment has occurred. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful lives of the investment’s underlying assets. A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any write-down of the carrying values of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $46.8 million, $37.8 million and $45.2 million, respectively, which are a component of costs and expenses. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. We did not recognize any impairment charges in connection with our equity-method investments during the three years ended December 31, 2018. 101 Table of Contents Valuation and Amortization Methods of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. The method used to value such assets depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns the asset is expected to generate. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to commercial relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. In certain instances, the acquisition of these intangible assets provides us with access to customers in a defined resource basin and is analogous to having a franchise in a particular area. Efficient operation of the acquired assets (e.g., a natural gas gathering system) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing producers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones within our existing asset footprint. The duration of this type of customer relationship is limited by the estimated economic life of the associated resource basin that supports the customer group. When estimating the economic life of a resource basin, we consider a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. In other situations, the acquisition of a customer relationship intangible asset provides us with access to customers whose hydrocarbon volumes are not attributable to specific resource basins. As with basin-specific customer relationships, efficient operation of the associated assets (e.g., a marine terminal that handles volumes originating from multiple sources) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing customers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones. The duration of this type of customer relationship is typically limited to the term of the underlying service contracts, including assumed renewals. The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the estimated economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization period for a basin-specific customer relationship asset is limited by the estimated finite economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basin. Contract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the third party customer storage and terminal contracts we acquired in connection with the Oiltanking transaction in October 2014. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the contract is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a marine terminal, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements. If our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset’s carrying value is not recoverable through its future cash flows, we would be required to reduce the asset’s carrying value to its estimated fair value through the recording of a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was $3.61 billion and $3.69 billion, respectively. We recorded $170.3 million, $166.9 million and $171.3 million of amortization expense attributable to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 102 Table of Contents Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is subject to annual impairment testing at the end of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is probable that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Goodwill impairment testing involves estimating the fair value of the associated reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the assets that comprise the reporting unit. These assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the associated businesses, which, in turn, rely on management’s estimates of operating margins, throughput volumes and similar inputs; (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast periods; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of a reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a non-cash impairment charge to costs and expenses is required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the carrying value of our goodwill was $5.75 billion. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the three years ended December 31, 2018. For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses As noted previously, preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect amounts presented in the financial statements. Due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions, we routinely employ estimates in connection with revenue and expense amounts in order to meet our accelerated financial reporting deadlines. Our most significant routine estimates involve certain natural gas processing plant revenues and costs, pipeline transportation revenues, fractionation revenues, marketing revenues and related purchases, and power and utility costs. These types of transactions must be estimated since the actual amounts are generally unavailable at the time we complete our accounting close process. The estimates subsequently reverse in the next accounting period when the corresponding actual customer billing or vendor-invoiced amounts are recorded. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates, which could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Prior to issuing our financial statements, we review our revenue and expense estimates based on currently available information to determine if adjustments are required. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. Other Matters Recent Accounting Developments For information regarding recent accounting developments involving revenue recognition and leases, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, operating leases were regarded as off-balance sheet arrangements. On January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases, which requires long-term leases to be recorded on the balance sheet. Based on current information, we expect to recognize an estimated $250 million of right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities in connection with operating leases. These amounts would represent less than 1% of our total consolidated assets and liabilities, respectively. 103 Table of Contents Related Party Transactions For information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Insurance For information regarding insurance matters, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions): Payment or Settlement due by Period In less than In 1-3 In 4-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1) $ 26,420.6 $ 1,500.0 $ 2,825.0 $ 2,650.0 $ 19,445.6 Estimated cash payments for interest (2) 25,520.2 1,190.4 2,195.4 1,980.0 20,154.4 Operating lease obligations (3) 324.8 50.5 84.3 51.7 138.3 Purchase obligations: Product purchase commitments (4) 10,273.7 2,558.4 3,980.6 1,823.9 1,910.8 Service payment commitments (5) 403.8 75.1 127.5 92.6 108.6 Capital expenditure commitments (6) 171.8 171.8 -- -- -- Other long-term liabilities (7) 751.6 -- 456.2 75.1 220.3 Total contractual payment obligations $ 63,866.5 $ 5,546.2 $ 9,669.0 $ 6,673.3 $ 41,978.0 (1) Represents scheduled future maturities of our current and long-term debt principal obligations. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2018, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable interest rates. Our estimated cash payments for interest are significantly influenced by the long-term maturities of our $2.67 billion in junior subordinated notes (due June 2067 through February 2078). Our estimated cash payments for interest assume that these subordinated notes are not repaid prior to their respective maturity dates. Our estimated cash payments for interest with respect to each junior subordinated note are based on either the current fixed interest rate charged or the weighted-average variable rate paid in 2018, as applicable, for each note applied to the remaining term through the respective maturity date. (3) Primarily represents land held pursuant to property leases, leases of underground salt dome caverns for the storage of natural gas and NGLs, the lease of transportation equipment used in our operations and office space with affiliates of EPCO. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services as of December 31, 2018. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2018 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Primarily represents our unconditional payment obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts. (6) Represents unconditional payment obligations for services to be rendered or products to be delivered in connection with our capital investment program, including our share of the capital expenditures of unconsolidated affiliates. (7) As reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018, “Other long-term liabilities” primarily represent the Liquidity Option Agreement, the noncurrent portion of asset retirement obligations and deferred revenues. In connection with our acquisition of the EFS Midstream System in 2015, we are obligated to spend up to an aggregate of $270 million on specified midstream gathering assets for certain producers, over a ten-year period. If constructed, these new assets would be owned by us and be a component of the EFS Midstream System. As of December 31, 2018, we have spent $151 million of the $270 million commitment. Due to the uncertain timing of the remaining potential capital expenditures, we have excluded this amount from the preceding table. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 104 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. General In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding and the discount rates used to determine the present values. The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming: § the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk; § the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and § the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period. We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. Accordingly, the nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and commodity and interest rate hedging activities. 105 Table of Contents Commodity Hedging Activities The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps, basis swaps and option contracts. The following table summarizes our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2018 (volume measures as noted): Volume (1) Accounting Derivative Purpose Current (2) Long-Term (2) Treatment Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas processing: Forecasted natural gas purchases for plant thermal reduction (Bcf) 4.9 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs (MMBbls) 1.0 n/a Cash flow hedge Octane enhancement: Forecasted purchase of NGLs (MMBbls) 1.8 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of octane enhancement products (MMBbls) 3.1 0.1 Cash flow hedge Natural gas marketing: Natural gas storage inventory management activities (Bcf) 3.3 n/a Fair value hedge NGL marketing: Forecasted purchases of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 33.6 4.3 Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 45.0 1.7 Cash flow hedge NGLs inventory management activities (MMBbls) 0.3 n/a Fair value hedge Refined products marketing: Forecasted purchases of refined products (MMBbls) 1.0 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of refined products (MMBbls) 2.0 n/a Cash flow hedge Refined products inventory management activities (MMBbls) 0.5 n/a Fair value hedge Crude oil marketing: Forecasted purchases of crude oil (MMBbls) 18.4 1.9 Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of crude oil (MMBbls) 28.5 1.9 Cash flow hedge Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas risk management activities (Bcf) (3,4) 77.5 0.9 Mark-to-market NGL risk management activities (MMBbls) (4) 3.3 n/a Mark-to-market Refined products risk management activities (MMBbls) (4) 2.6 n/a Mark-to-market Crude oil risk management activities (MMBbls) (4) 26.3 3.2 Mark-to-market (1) Volume for derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflects the total amount of volumes hedged whereas volume for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflects the absolute value of derivative notional volumes. (2) The maximum term for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is December 2020, June 2019 and December 2020, respectively. (3) Current volume includes 29.8 Bcf of physical derivative instruments that are predominantly priced at a marked-based index plus a premium or minus a discount related to location differences. (4) Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with transportation, processing and storage assets. At December 31, 2018, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging natural gas processing margins and (iii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory. § The objective of our anticipated future commodity purchases and sales hedging program is to hedge the margins of certain transportation, storage, blending and operational activities by locking in purchase and sale prices through the use of derivative instruments and related contracts. § The objective of our natural gas processing hedging program is to hedge an amount of earnings associated with these activities. We achieve this objective by executing fixed-price sales for a portion of our expected equity NGL production using derivative instruments and related contracts. For certain natural gas processing contracts, the hedging of expected equity NGL production also involves the purchase of natural gas for shrinkage, which is hedged using derivative instruments and related contracts. 106 Table of Contents § The objective of our inventory hedging program is to hedge the fair value of commodity products currently held in inventory by locking in the sales price of the inventory through the use of derivative instruments and related contracts. Sensitivity Analysis The following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair values of our principal commodity derivative instrument portfolios at the dates indicated (dollars in millions). The fair value information presented in the sensitivity analysis tables excludes the impact of applying Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) Rule 814, which deems that financial instruments cleared by the CME are settled daily in connection with variation margin payments. As a result of this exchange rule, CME-related derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and subject to future commodity price fluctuations until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms. Derivative transactions cleared on exchanges other than the CME (e.g., the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE) continue to be reported on a gross basis.

This amount is comprised of $118.8 million of net deferred hedge gains attributable to cash flow hedges partially offset by aggregate net unrealized losses of $60.0 million attributable to fair value hedges and mark-to-market derivative instruments. The following table reflects how the net unrealized loss at December 31, 2018 will impact future earnings in the periods indicated (dollars in millions): Net unrealized loss at December 31, 2018 $ (60.0 ) Reversal of net unrealized loss (recognized as net unrealized mark-to-market gains) by period: Calendar year 2019: First quarter 11.1 Second quarter 22.1 Third quarter 19.8 Fourth quarter 4.9 Total 2019 57.9 Calendar year 2020 2.1 Total net unrealized mark-to-market gains 60.0 Total impact on earnings $ -- 107 Table of Contents As the unrealized mark-to-market gains attributable to the financial hedges are recognized in earnings, the corresponding actual losses on the financial hedges and related gains on the physical transactions will be simultaneously realized. Interest Rate Hedging Activities We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain consolidated debt agreements. This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. The composition of our derivative instrument portfolios may change depending on our hedging requirements. We have no interest rate hedging instruments outstanding as of the filing date of this annual report. Product Purchase Obligations We have long-term purchase commitments for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. For additional information regarding these commitments, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.",2023-12-30 21:17:23.445584

Overview of Business We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.” We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the U.S., Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. Our midstream energy operations currently include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and export and import terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases, or “LPG,” and ethane); crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and export and import terminals; petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, export and import terminals, and related services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems. Our assets currently include approximately 50,000 miles of pipelines; 260 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products; and 14 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity. The safe operation of our assets is a top priority. We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of the public and those working on our behalf by conducting our business activities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. For additional information, see “Environmental, Safety and Conservation” within the Regulatory Matters section of Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report. We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. We, Enterprise GP, EPCO and Dan Duncan LLC are affiliates under the collective common control of the DD LLC Trustees and the EPCO Trustees. Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the “ASA”) or by other service providers. Our operations are reported under four business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, and (iv) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. 67 Table of Contents Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our related marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measure, for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. Our results of operations and financial condition are subject to certain significant risks. Factors that can affect the demand for our products and services include domestic and international economic conditions, the market price and demand for energy, the cost to develop natural gas and crude oil reserves in the U.S., federal and state regulation, the cost and availability of capital to energy companies to invest in upstream exploration and production activities and the credit quality of our customers. For information regarding such risks, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. In addition, our business activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing a wide variety of topics, including commercial, operational, environmental and other matters. For a discussion of the principal effects of such laws and regulations on our business activities, see “Regulatory Matters” included under Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report. Significant Recent Developments Enterprise Provides Distribution and Buyback Guidance for 2020 In January 2020, management announced its plans to continue to recommend to the Board of Enterprise GP an increase of $0.0025 per unit per quarter to our cash distribution rate with respect to 2020. The anticipated rate of increase would result in distributions for 2020 (of $1.805 per unit) being 2.3% higher than those paid with respect to 2019 (of $1.765 per unit). The payment of any quarterly cash distribution is subject to Board approval and management’s evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in connection with such payments. In addition, management announced its intention to use approximately 2.0% of net cash flow provided by operating activities, or cash flow from operations (“CFFO”), in 2020 to repurchase EPD common units under the Buyback Program approved in January 2019 (the “2019 Buyback Program”). For information regarding the 2019 Buyback Program, including repurchases of common units in 2019, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Common Unit Buyback Program” within this Part II, Item 7. Enterprise Begins Service at Mentone Natural Gas Processing Facility In December 2019, we completed the first processing train at our Mentone cryogenic natural gas processing facility (“Mentone I”) and placed it into service. The Mentone facility, which is located in Loving County, Texas, has a current capacity to process 300 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract more than 40 MBPD of NGLs. Mentone and its related infrastructure further extends our presence in the Delaware Basin and provides producers access to our fully integrated midstream asset network, including our Texas Intrastate System and Shin Oak NGL Pipeline. We own and operate the Mentone facility and related infrastructure. With Mentone I in operation, we have the capability to process up to 1.6 Bcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 250 MBPD of NGL production from our processing facilities in the Delaware Basin. On a related note, we completed and placed into service a third processing train (“Orla III”) at our cryogenic natural gas processing facility located near Orla, Texas in Reeves County in July 2019. The Orla facility is capable of processing up to 900 MMcf/d of natural gas and extracting up to 140 MBPD of NGLs. Like Mentone, the Orla facility and related infrastructure supports continued growth of NGL-rich natural gas production from the Delaware Basin. We own and operate the Orla facility. 68 Table of Contents Enterprise Begins Service at Bulldog Natural Gas Processing Plant In November 2019, we placed our Bulldog cryogenic natural gas processing plant, which is located near Carthage, Texas, into service. The Bulldog plant has the capability to process up to 200 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 12 MBPD of NGLs. When combined with our legacy Panola cryogenic plant, Bulldog provides us with the capacity to process up to a total of 320 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 18 MBPD of NGLs in the region. The new plant supports continued growth of natural gas production from the Cotton Valley and Haynesville formations in East Texas. In addition, the Bulldog plant complements our value chain as the mixed NGLs produced at the plant are transported on the Panola pipeline to Mont Belvieu for fractionation. Enterprise Begins Service at Isobutane Dehydrogenation Unit In December 2019, we completed construction and placed our isobutane dehydrogenation (“iBDH”) unit into service. The facility, which is located at our Mont Belvieu complex and supported by long-term, fee-based contracts, is capable of processing approximately 25 MBPD of butane into nearly 1 billion pounds per year of isobutylene. Production from the iBDH plant will enable us to optimize our methyl tertiary butyl ether (“MTBE”) and high purity isobutylene (“HPIB”) assets and meet growing market demand for isobutylene. Steam crackers and refineries have historically been the major source of propane and butane olefins for downstream use; however, with the increased use of light-end feedstocks such as ethane, the need for “on purpose” olefins production has increased. Like our PDH facility, the iBDH plant will help meet market demand where traditional supplies have been reduced. The iBDH plant will increase our production of high purity and low purity isobutylene, both of which are used as feedstocks to manufacture lubricants, rubber products and fuel additives. Enterprise Begins Service at Ethylene Export Terminal In December 2019, we placed our ethylene export terminal into limited service, with the first cargo of 25 million pounds of ethylene exported in January 2020. The terminal, which we operate, is located at our Morgan’s Point facility on the Houston Ship Channel and features two docks and the capacity to load 2.2 billion pounds of ethylene per year. A refrigerated storage tank for 66 million pounds of ethylene is being constructed on-site that will allow the terminal to load ethylene up to a rate of 2.2 million pounds per hour. Full commercial operations at the terminal are expected in the fourth quarter of 2020 once certain refrigeration assets are complete. We own a 50% member interest in Enterprise Navigator Ethylene Terminal LLC, which owns the export facility. Our ethylene system is being developed to serve as an open market storage and trading hub for the ethylene industry using storage capacity, connections to multiple ethylene pipelines, and high-volume export capabilities. In support of our ethylene business, we recently placed into service a high-capacity underground ethylene storage well at our Mont Belvieu complex having a storage capacity of 600 million pounds of ethylene. The storage well is connected to our Morgan’s Point ethylene export terminal by a 16-mile pipeline, which was placed into service in December 2019. An additional 8 miles of ethylene pipelines extending from Morgan’s Point to Bayport, Texas are under construction and expected to be completed and placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2020. In May 2019, we announced plans to further expand our ethylene pipeline and logistics system by constructing the Baymark ethylene pipeline in South Texas, which is a leading growth area for new ethylene crackers and related facilities. The Baymark pipeline will originate in Bayport, Texas and extend approximately 90 miles to Markham, Texas. The Baymark pipeline is supported by long-term customer commitments and is expected to begin service in the fourth quarter of 2020. We will own a 70% interest in and operate the Baymark pipeline. Customers using the Baymark pipeline will have access to our high-capacity ethylene storage well in Mont Belvieu and our export terminal at Morgan’s Point. 69 Table of Contents Enterprise Announces Final Investment Decision Regarding the Sea Port Oil Terminal In July 2019, we announced the execution of long-term customer agreements with Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (“Chevron”) supporting the development of our Sea Port Oil Terminal (“SPOT”) in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of the Chevron agreements, we announced our final investment decision with respect to SPOT, subject to obtaining the required approvals and licenses from the federal Maritime Administration, which is currently reviewing our SPOT application. The SPOT project consists of onshore and offshore facilities, including a fixed platform located approximately 30 nautical miles off the Brazoria County, Texas coast in approximately 115 feet of water. SPOT is designed to load Very Large Crude Carriers (“VLCCs”) at rates of approximately 85,000 barrels per hour. We believe that SPOT’s design meets or exceeds federal requirements for such facilities and, unlike existing and other proposed offshore terminals, is designed with a vapor control system to minimize emissions. In December 2019, we announced the execution of a letter of intent (“LOI”) with an affiliate of Enbridge Inc. (“Enbridge”) to jointly develop our SPOT in the Gulf of Mexico. Under terms of the LOI, we agreed to negotiate an equity participation right agreement with Enbridge whereby, subject to SPOT receiving a deepwater port license, an affiliate of Enbridge could acquire a noncontrolling member interest in SPOT Terminal Services LLC, which owns SPOT. Enterprise to Build Midland-to-ECHO 4 Pipeline In October 2019, we announced long-term agreements supporting construction of the “Midland-to-ECHO 4” pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline will connect our Midland terminal in Midland, Texas with our ECHO terminal in Houston, Texas utilizing both new construction and segments of our existing crude oil pipelines in South Texas. The Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline is expected to enter service during the second quarter of 2021 and have an initial transportation capacity of 450 MBPD (expandable up to 540 MBPD). When placed into service, the Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline will allow our shippers with crude oil and condensate production in both the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale to maximize the value of their contracted pipeline capacity by allowing shippers to source barrels from the Permian Basin and/or the Eagle Ford Shale. This unmatched flexibility will allow shippers and producers to dynamically match their pipeline capacity to their allocation of capital and respective production profiles between the two basins. Their production will be delivered into our integrated storage, pipeline, distribution and marine terminal system that has access to both domestic and international markets. The Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline complements our Midland-to-ECHO 1 and 2 pipelines, which entered full service in the second quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019, respectively, as well as our Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline, which is comprised of a 29% undivided interest in a 36-inch pipeline we are currently constructing from Midland, Texas to our ECHO terminal and further to a third-party terminal in Webster, Texas, is expected to provide 200 MBPD of transportation capacity when placed into service during the third quarter of 2020, increasing to approximately 450 MBPD during the fourth quarter of 2020. Together, these four projects (Midland-to-ECHO 1, 2, 3 and 4) comprise our Midland-to-ECHO System, which supports crude oil production growth from the Permian Basin (and Eagle Ford Shale, as applicable) by providing producers and other shippers with transportation solutions that are both cost-efficient and operationally flexible. The Midland-to-ECHO System is expected to include 6 MMBbls of storage at our Midland terminal and access to more than 45 MMBbls of storage and approximately 4 MMBPD of export capacity at partnership assets along the Texas Gulf Coast. The network connects to every refinery in the Houston, Texas City and Beaumont/Port Arthur area, which we believe represents approximately 8 MMBPD of refining capacity. In January 2019, we completed the conversion of the Midland-to-Sealy segment of one of our two Seminole NGL pipelines from NGL service to crude oil service, thus creating the Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline. The pipeline originates at our Midland terminal and extends 444 miles to our Sealy terminal, with crude oil volumes arriving at Sealy transported to our ECHO terminal using the Rancho II pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, which was placed into limited service in February 2019 and full service in April 2019, provides us with up to 225 MBPD of incremental crude oil transportation capacity. We retain the flexibility to convert this pipeline back to NGL service should future market conditions support the need for additional NGL transportation capacity out of the Permian Basin. 70 Table of Contents Enterprise to Build Second Propane Dehydrogenation (“PDH”) Plant In September 2019, we announced the execution of long-term, fee-based contracts with affiliates of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. that support construction of our second PDH facility (referred to as “PDH 2”). The new plant is expected to have the capacity to consume up to 35 MBPD of propane and produce up to 1.65 billion pounds per year of PGP. PDH 2 will be located in Chambers County, Texas at our Mont Belvieu complex and is scheduled to begin service in the first quarter of 2023. Once PDH 2 is placed into service and integrated with PDH 1 and our other propylene production facilities, we will have the capability to produce 11 billion pounds of propylene per year. Enterprise to Expand and Extend Acadian Gas System In September 2019, we announced plans to expand and extend our Acadian Gas System in order to deliver growing natural gas production from the Haynesville Shale to the liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) market in South Louisiana. The expansion project will include construction of an approximately 80-mile natural gas pipeline (the “Gillis Lateral”) extending from near Cheneyville, Louisiana to third-party pipeline interconnects near Gillis, Louisiana, including multiple pipelines serving regional LNG export facilities. In addition to construction of the Gillis Lateral, we plan to increase the transportation capacity of the Haynesville Extension from 1.8 Bcf/d to 2.1 Bcf/d by adding horsepower at our compressor station in Mansfield, Louisiana. The Mansfield project and construction of the Gillis Lateral are supported by long-term customer contracts and are expected to begin service in the third quarter of 2021. Once the expansion project is completed, we expect that our Acadian Gas System will be able to deliver up to 2.1 Bcf/d of Haynesville Shale production into the LNG market, South Louisiana industrial complex and other pipeline interconnects that serve attractive southeastern U.S. markets. Shin Oak NGL Pipeline Commences Operations; Altus Acquires 33% Equity Interest in Shin Oak The Shin Oak NGL Pipeline (“Shin Oak”) transports NGL production from the Permian Basin to our NGL fractionation and storage complex located at the Mont Belvieu hub. In February 2019, the 24-inch diameter mainline segment of Shin Oak from Orla, Texas to Mont Belvieu was placed into limited service with an initial transportation capacity of 250 MBPD. In June 2019, an additional pipeline segment, the 20-inch diameter Waha lateral, was placed into service and increased Shin Oak’s transportation capacity to 350 MBPD. We completed construction of the remaining components of Shin Oak in the fourth quarter of 2019, which increased its transportation capacity to 550 MBPD. In May 2018, we granted Apache Midstream LLC (“Apache”) an option to acquire up to a 33% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns Shin Oak. In November 2018, Apache contributed this option to Altus Midstream Processing LP (“Altus”), which is a consolidated subsidiary of Apache. In July 2019, Altus exercised the option and acquired a 33% equity interest (effective July 31, 2019) in our subsidiary that owns Shin Oak. As a result, we received a $440.7 million cash payment from Altus, which is included in contributions from noncontrolling interests as presented on our Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. Expansion Projects at EHT In July 2019, we announced expansion projects at EHT that are expected to increase our loading capacity for crude oil and LPG at the terminal. With respect to crude oil, we are adding an eighth deep-water ship dock at EHT that is expected to increase our crude oil loading capacity by 840 MBPD, thereby increasing our overall nameplate crude oil loading capacity at EHT to 2.75 MMBPD, or nearly 83 MMBbls per month. The new dock is designed to accommodate a Suezmax vessel, which is the largest ship class that can navigate the Houston Ship Channel, and is scheduled to be placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2020. With respect to LPG, our current estimated maximum loading capacity at EHT is approximately 835 MBPD, with 175 MBPD of this loading capacity placed into service during the third quarter of 2019. The expansion project announced in July 2019 is currently expected to increase our LPG loading capacity at EHT by an additional 265 MBPD and be placed into service during the second half of 2021. When this latest expansion project is completed, EHT will have a new maximum LPG loading capacity of approximately 1.1 MMBPD, or 33 MMBbls per month. 71 Table of Contents In light of growing international demand for PGP, we also announced in July 2019 an expansion project at EHT that is currently expected to increase its export capability for semi- or fully-refrigerated PGP by 3,500 barrels per hour, or approximately 84 MBPD. Our current loading capacity at EHT for PGP is approximately 2,500 barrels per hour, or 60 MBPD, of semi-refrigerated product. With the addition of fully refrigerated volumes due to the expansion project, EHT will be able to co-load fully refrigerated PGP and LPG volumes onto the same vessel. This expansion project is expected to be placed into service during the second half of 2021. General Outlook for 2020 We provide midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are contingent on the supply of, and demand for the energy commodities we handle across our integrated midstream energy asset network. The following information presents our views on key midstream energy supply and demand fundamentals going into 2020. Supply Side Observations The upstream energy industry, led by the efforts of major oil companies, continues to shift resources to shale supply basins. Domestic shale resources continue to play a key role in both U.S. and global markets, further supporting that the U.S. is a major oil supplier on par with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and Russia. The U.S. became a net natural gas exporter on an annual basis in 2017, and it continued to export more natural gas than it imported in both 2018 and 2019. We believe that a significant portion of the expected growth in U.S. crude oil, natural gas and NGL production in 2020 will be destined for export markets. As measured by New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”), WTI oil prices started 2019 at $45.41 per barrel but rapidly increased to $66.30 per barrel on April 23, 2019 as OPEC and Russia maintained their supply cuts and the U.S. imposed sanctions on Iran, which restricted crude oil exports from that country to a minimum. However, prices subsequently softened as a result of continued trade disputes between the U.S. and other countries, with China in particular. Counteracting these “trade headwinds” was the fact that crude oil production growth in the U.S. was slowing in response to producers cutting back on drilling activities in an effort to preserve cash and enhance their financial condition in a capital-constrained environment. Consequently, WTI prices fluctuated between $51 and $66 per barrel for the rest of 2019. The WTI oil price finished 2019 at $61.06 per barrel and averaged $57.03 per barrel for all of 2019 compared to an average of $64.77 per barrel for 2018. WTI prices in 2020 have ranged from a high of $63.27 per barrel to a low of $49.57 per barrel through February 10, 2020. The forward commodity markets for WTI (as reported by the NYMEX) currently indicate monthly pricing in the range of $51.17 to $52.11 per barrel for periods extending through February 2021. As reported by the EIA, U.S. crude oil production, having finished 2018 at 12 MMBPD, spent the first seven months of 2019 between 11.7 MMBPD and 12.1 MMBPD. Nevertheless, U.S. crude oil production accelerated during the latter part of the year at a record high of 12.9 MMBPD in November 2019. In addition, as reported by the EIA, U.S. production of NGLs increased steadily throughout 2019 and averaged a record 4.8 MMBPD for the year. For 2018, U.S. production of NGLs averaged 4.4 MMBPD. The focus of U.S. exploration and production companies in 2019 was more on exercising capital discipline than increasing production. Rig counts (as reported by Baker Hughes) reflect this emphasis, declining 26% over the course of 2019 from 1,083 in December 2018 to 805 in December 2019. However, not all regions slowed equally. The Permian Basin rig count fell 17% while the Haynesville Shale rig count fell 6%, whereas the Cana Woodford rig count fell 64%. As rig counts declined and fewer wells were drilled in 2019, producers gradually began to work off their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells (“DUCs”). As reported by the EIA, the DUC count declined to approximately 7,600 in November 2019 from 8,000 in December 2018. Of the current DUCs, approximately 3,600 are in the Permian Basin. DUCs represent a significant potential volume that will continue to be brought into production. 72 Table of Contents Near-term global economic growth has been adversely impacted by the emergence of the coronavirus, officially designated as Covid-19, in China, and then in several other countries and regions including the U.S., Japan and Europe. As a result of this public health concern, a significant amount of global commerce has been affected due to travel restrictions, quarantines, and similar measures. Analysts from S&P recently estimated that the virus could lower China’s gross domestic product by approximately 1% in 2020, with a peak effect in the first quarter of 2020 before rebounding in the third quarter of 2020. Overall, economists estimate that headwinds from the virus could reduce global economic growth in 2020 by 0.2% to 0.3%, while in the U.S. first quarter of 2020 growth could be reduced by 0.2% to 0.4%. The impact of reduced hydrocarbon demand in Asia due to the virus has been felt in the price of crude oil. WTI prices have declined approximately 22% since the beginning of 2020 (as reported by the NYMEX), which we believe was largely attributable to perceived global economic weakness caused by responses to the virus. In response to the crisis, OPEC is considering production cuts to limit the potential oversupply of crude oil in global markets. We continue to monitor this situation and its potential impact on our operations. U.S. natural gas production increased from an average of 84 Bcf/d in 2018 to 91 Bcf/d in 2019 per the EIA. As a result, natural gas prices, as measured by the NYMEX at Henry Hub, averaged $2.53 per MMBtu in 2019 compared to an average of $3.07 per MMBtu in 2018. Henry Hub natural gas prices in 2020 have ranged from a high of $2.20 per MMBtu to a low of $1.77 per MMBtu through February 10, 2020. The decline in price is generally due to lower demand due to warmer winter weather and abundant natural gas supplies due to shale production. The forward commodity markets for Henry Hub natural gas (as reported by the NYMEX) currently indicate monthly pricing in the range of $1.85 to $2.61 per MMBtu for periods extending through March 2021, with longer term prices currently indicated at $2.20 to $3.20 per MMBtu. Assuming stable natural gas prices, we believe that U.S. natural gas production should be sufficient to meet both domestic and export demand. With the continued growth in shale production, the EIA reports that the U.S. is becoming a major exporter of natural gas, with LNG exports averaging 4.6 Bcf/d in 2019 and pipeline exports to Mexico averaging 5.1 Bcf/d in 2019. With the completion of several construction projects by the end of 2020, U.S. LNG liquefaction capacity (according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”)) is expected to exceed 9 Bcf/d, which we believe will make natural gas production and prices highly sensitive to fluctuations in LNG exports. In fact, some in the industry would argue that U.S. gas prices could become more dependent on international LNG markets in contrast to being traditionally dependent on domestic demand and weather. We operate in a number of major domestic supply basins, including the Permian, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Rockies. The following information represents our general outlook for each of these key basins: • The Permian Basin in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico has experienced the largest increase in production in the country. According to the December 2019 EIA Drilling Productivity Report (“2019 EIA Report”), production in the Permian Basin was 4.7 MMBPD of crude oil and 16.3 Bcf/d of natural gas in November 2019. The basin continues to have many advantages relative to other producing regions, including up to 10 or more stacked pay zones, light sweet crude oil and significant infrastructure. With 405 drilling rigs working in the Permian Basin as of December 2019 (as reported by Baker Hughes), and major oil companies such as Exxon and Chevron focused on developing their presence in the basin, we expect production to continue to grow. A prime example of our commitment to Permian Basin producers is our Midland-to-ECHO System. This network supports crude oil production growth from the basin by providing producers and other shippers with transportation solutions that are both cost efficient and operationally flexible. We placed our Midland-to-ECHO 1 and Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipelines into full commercial service during the second quarter of 2018 and second quarter of 2019, respectively. The Midland-to-ECHO 3 and Midland-to-ECHO 4 projects are expected to begin service during the third quarter of 2020 and first half of 2021, respectively. When fully complete, our Midland-to-ECHO System is expected to provide us with up to 1.8 MMBPD of crude oil transportation capacity to U.S. Gulf Coast and international markets, while assuring the quality and grade of the crude oil being shipped. 73 Table of Contents An area of particular focus for us has been the development of midstream infrastructure serving producers in the Delaware Basin, which is part of the Permian Basin. Prior to the shale production boom, the Delaware Basin was a lightly drilled area due to a lack of conventional targets; however, with the introduction of horizontal drilling techniques and identification of stacked targets of tight rock and shales, drilling in the Delaware Basin has accelerated greatly over the past five years. These drilling targets have proven to produce not only crude oil but also condensate and NGLs, which present us with a significant number of opportunities to provide midstream services to producers. We are actively working with producers to identify those midstream infrastructure projects that best serve their needs and complement our integrated asset network. Two examples of our initiatives in the Delaware Basin are the Orla and Mentone natural gas processing facilities. At our Orla processing facility, we placed two processing trains (Orla I and II) into service in 2018, and a third processing train (Orla III) was placed into service in July 2019. With three trains, the Orla facility has 900 MMcf/d of total processing capacity and allows us to extract up to 140 MBPD of mixed NGLs. Our Mentone natural gas processing facility was announced in October 2018 and its first processing train (Mentone I) entered service in December 2019. Following the completion of Mentone I, we have the capability to process up to 1.6 Bcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 250 MBPD of NGLs from our processing facilities in the Delaware Basin. Given our investment in NGL pipeline infrastructure in the region (e.g., Shin Oak), we believe that we are well positioned to accommodate NGL production growth from these plants and third party natural gas processing facilities in the Permian Basin. Overall, we have a positive outlook regarding the Permian Basin and continue to evaluate projects that meet the midstream needs of producers. • In the Eagle Ford Shale (“Eagle Ford”), crude oil and natural gas production for 2019 was essentially the same as that for 2018. According to the 2019 EIA Report, production in the Eagle Ford was 1.4 MMBPD of crude oil and 6.9 Bcf/d of natural gas in November 2019. The number of drilling rigs working in the Eagle Ford (as reported by Baker Hughes) decreased from 80 at the beginning of 2019 to 67 in December 2019; however, it appears that the rig count has stabilized as we enter 2020. Production acreage in the Eagle Ford continued to change ownership during 2019, which contributed to increased drilling activity in the region by the new owners. ConocoPhillips, EOG and other producers continue to show strong interest in the Eagle Ford, which could result in higher volumes for our midstream network; however, until volumes for the basin exceed historical peak production, there will be excess capacity of midstream infrastructure available in the region. According to the EIA, the historical peak for Eagle Ford crude oil and natural gas production occurred in March 2015 and was 1.7 MMBPD and 7.4 Bcf/d, respectively. We believe that the Eagle Ford offers producers some of the best returns on capital of any region in the country due to its proximity to major consumption and export markets along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Furthermore, we believe that our integrated midstream network will provide us with operating leverage as production increases. • With respect to the Haynesville Shale (“Haynesville”), natural gas production is increasing due to higher rig counts and improved drilling efficiencies. As reported by Baker Hughes, the number of gas drilling rigs working in the Haynesville has increased from a low of 11 rigs in 2016 to an average of 52 rigs in 2019. Like the Eagle Ford, we saw several significant changes in the ownership of producing properties in 2019, which contributed to increased drilling activity in the region by the new owners. According to the 2019 EIA Report, natural gas production in the Haynesville reached record levels in 2019, with production increasing to approximately 12.3 Bcf/d in November 2019. Assuming supportive natural gas prices, we believe these trends will continue. In 2017, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that the Haynesville and the associated Bossier Shale plays hold a combined 304 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas resources, which is the second highest level in the U.S. after the Appalachia region. The Haynesville benefits from its close proximity to U.S. Gulf Coast markets where significant petrochemical plant projects and LNG export facilities are being constructed. According to the FERC, the LNG market in South Louisiana and Southeast Texas, including facilities under construction, is expected to reach an aggregate 15 Bcf/d of export capacity. In September 2019, we announced construction of the Gillis Lateral and Mansfield compressor station project, both of which will support continued production growth in the Haynesville. 74 Table of Contents • In the Rocky Mountain region, rig counts (as reported by Baker Hughes) in the Piceance and San Juan basins and also in the Jonah field were essentially flat in 2019 when compared to 2018; however, the predominant producer in the Pinedale field suspended drilling in 2019 due to low commodity prices. As we move into 2020, we expect that Piceance, San Juan and Jonah producers will continue a modest level of conventional drilling with certain developments showing encouraging long-term trends. In the Piceance Basin, operators have drilled several horizontal wells in the Williams Fork formation and obtained permits for deeper wells in the Mancos Shale. In the San Juan Basin, operators continue to drill horizontal wells in both the crude oil and natural gas horizons of the Mancos Shale. In the Jonah field, producers saw positive results from recent horizontal well tests and plan to continue these efforts into 2020. Producers in the Rockies benefit from sufficient natural gas and NGL pipeline infrastructure, which helps the region compete with other North American regions where production takeaway capacity is constrained. We believe that our Rocky Mountain assets will continue to benefit regional producers by allowing them access to major downstream markets such as U.S. Gulf Coast and export destinations. Demand Side Observations Global economic growth continues to drive demand for petroleum-based products. In February 2020, the International Energy Agency (“IEA”) reported that global demand for crude oil and NGLs grew by a combined 1.0 MMBPD in 2019 and expects demand to grow by approximately 0.8 MMBPD in 2020. Recent statements by the IEA and other sources suggest that the coronavirus will soften near-term global demand for hydrocarbons, particularly in Asia, in the first quarter of 2020, with a likely rebound in demand during the third quarter of 2020. In December 2019, the IEA forecast that overall long-term demand for crude oil and NGLs by the countries represented by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) will decline by approximately 0.3 MMBPD between 2019 and 2024, while non-OECD demand would increase by 6 MMBPD over the same period. The IEA expects that petrochemicals will account for approximately 31% of the increase in long-term global demand for crude oil and NGLs over this period. As its reference case, the IEA’s long-term outlook for crude oil and NGL demand points to either a plateau after 2030, or to slow growth of approximately 0.2% from 2025 to 2040. We, along with a majority of forecasters, expect that long-term demand for liquid hydrocarbons such as crude oil and NGLs should not decline before the year 2040. Demand for liquid hydrocarbons is generally driven by the following sectors: airline and rail transportation, marine bunker fuel, motor fuels (gasoline and diesel) for cars, trucks and similar vehicles, industrial users, residential and commercial heating, and feedstocks in petrochemical and plastics manufacturing. Practically speaking, liquid hydrocarbons cannot be reasonably or economically replaced for each of these uses by other forms of energy in this forecast period given current technologies. Although the IEA and other forecasters project electric-powered vehicles modestly supplanting gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles in certain markets during this period, the decrease in motor fuel demand is outweighed by demand growth in other sectors for liquid hydrocarbons. We continuously review third-party economic forecasts in connection with our long-term planning. In general, third party forecasts such as the IEA’s are subject to a variety of assumptions including: (i) current views of leading economic forecasters and demographers with respect to assumed economic and demographic trends; (ii) improvements in energy production, delivery and consumption technologies; (iii) current laws and regulations that affect the energy sector are unchanged throughout the 2020-2050 projection period; (iv) future commodity prices and (v) reduced costs for renewables. Changes to these and other assumptions by forecasters may yield higher or lower outlooks for hydrocarbon demand and supply over the long-term. The North American “shale revolution” has transformed the U.S. into the global, low-cost supplier of NGLs. We expect this trend to continue into 2020 and beyond supported by, among other things: (i) the ability of U.S. shale producers to reduce development costs and improve the productivity of new and existing wells, (ii) regulatory changes in various international markets such as India and China favoring the use of clean-burning fuels and low-sulfur hydrocarbons such as those found in U.S. shale oil basins and (iii) higher demand in developing economics for liquid hydrocarbons in general. As a midstream energy company, we continue to foresee a variety of long-term, demand-side opportunities from these developments, including higher demand from the U.S. petrochemical industry and increased exports of hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, LPG and crude oil) to growing international markets. 75 Table of Contents International demand for U.S. ethane is expected to remain robust in 2020, as ethane from domestic shale basins offers the global petrochemical industry a low-cost feedstock option plus supply diversification. Our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, the largest of its kind in the world, enables us to meet this demand and has an aggregate loading rate (nameplate capacity) of approximately 10,000 barrels per hour of fully refrigerated ethane. With respect to the U.S. petrochemical industry, abundant supplies of shale-sourced ethane provides the U.S. with one of the cheapest feedstocks available for ethylene production. The American Chemistry Council estimates that over $200 billion is being invested in domestic petrochemical plants, with most of those investments tied directly to producing ethylene from cost-advantaged U.S. ethane. Of the new domestic facilities, seven world-scale ethylene plants are currently operational and we estimate that they have a combined ethylene production capacity of 17.7 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 490 MBPD. An additional four plants are being commissioned and expected to enter service in 2020, with an estimated aggregate ethylene production capacity of 7.2 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 205 MBPD. An additional four plants are expected to enter service in the early 2020s. We anticipate that these later plants will have a combined ethylene production capacity of 7.5 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 205 MBPD. We also anticipate demand growth for ethane as a feedstock resulting from modifications (e.g., debottlenecking, furnace modifications, etc.) made to other existing domestic facilities. Our midstream assets are located in close proximity to virtually all domestic ethane-consuming petrochemical plants, as well as associated derivative plants that produce various polymer products from ethylene. As a result of the expected growth in U.S. ethylene production capacity, we completed and commissioned an ethylene export terminal located at Morgan’s Point on the Houston Ship Channel in December 2019. The project, which is underwritten by long-term customer commitments, is expected to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2020 once certain refrigeration assets are completed. To a limited extent, global demand for the end products produced by the petrochemical and plastics sector is currently under pressure mostly due to improper plastic disposal methods, particularly the accumulation of plastic garbage in the world’s oceans. This situation has resulted in calls for better collection, recycling and disposal of plastics and bans of certain single-use plastic items. Although higher recycling rates and bans of certain single-use items would effectively reduce the rate of growth in global demand for plastics, we do not believe that such actions will result in a significant long-term decline in the production of plastics (or in the use of liquid hydrocarbons as feedstocks in the production of such items). With respect to long-term LPG demand, we believe that U.S. exports to Asia, particularly China and India, as well as markets in Northwest Europe and Latin America, will continue to be strong. According to EIA data available through November 2019, U.S. LPG exports increased 17% in 2019 to 1.4 MMBPD, with volumes headed to Asian markets accounting for approximately 51% of this amount. We estimate that LPG exports could reach 2.5 to 2.8 MMBPD by 2025. Our outlook for LPG exports to Asia is supported by several factors including long-term economic growth rates in Asian markets and favorable domestic policies in countries like India and Indonesia where governments are subsidizing their population’s switch from wood-based fuels to LPG for domestic use as a means of reducing pollution and protecting against deforestation. The competitiveness of U.S. Gulf Coast supplies of LPG are enhanced by the recent widening of the Panama Canal in 2016. Due to our expectation of continued growth in LPG exports, we completed an expansion project at EHT in 2019 that increased our LPG loading capacity at the terminal to approximately 835 MBPD. In July 2019, we announced an additional expansion project at EHT that would increase our LPG loading capacity by an additional 265 MBPD and be placed into service during the second half of 2021. Lastly, as U.S. crude oil production increased, these new domestic barrels continue to supplant more of the U.S.’s crude oil imports, while the remainder are exported to international markets in Central and South America, Asia and Western Europe where the lighter U.S. crudes are used as feedstock in their refining and petrochemical facilities. We expect U.S. refiners to continue to operate at high rates as a result of steady U.S. demand and growing exports of refined products. We believe that our marine terminals and related storage and pipeline infrastructure that handle crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals are strategically located to meet the concurrent needs of export and import customers. We have significant export capabilities, with expansion potential, on the Houston Ship Channel, Beaumont, Freeport and Texas City, Texas. 76 Table of Contents In July 2019, we announced long-term agreements with Chevron that support the development of SPOT in the Gulf of Mexico. SPOT is designed to load VLCCs at rates of approximately 85,000 barrels per hour. Construction of SPOT remains subject to obtaining the required approvals and licenses from the federal Maritime Administration, which is currently reviewing our SPOT application. SPOT would provide customers with an integrated export solution that leverages our extensive supply, storage and distribution network along the Gulf Coast, with access to approximately 6 MMBbls of crude oil supply and more than 300 MMBbls of storage based on our estimates.

(3) Polymer grade propylene prices represent average contract pricing for such product as reported by IHS Chemical, a division of IHS Inc. (“IHS Chemical”). Refinery grade propylene prices represent weighted-average spot prices for such product as reported by IHS Chemical. (4) The “Indicative Gas Processing Gross Spread” represents a generic estimate of the gross economic benefit from extracting NGLs from natural gas production based on certain pricing assumptions. Specifically, it is the amount by which the assumed economic value of a composite gallon of NGLs at Mont Belvieu, Texas exceeds the value of the equivalent amount of energy in natural gas at Henry Hub, Louisiana (as presented in the table above). The indicative spread does not consider the operating costs incurred by a natural gas processing facility to extract the NGLs nor the transportation and fractionation costs to deliver the NGLs to market. In addition, the actual gas processing spread earned at each plant is determined by regional pricing and extraction dynamics. As presented in the table above, the indicative spread assumes that a gallon of NGLs is comprised of 47% ethane, 28% propane, 9% normal butane, 6% isobutane and 10% natural gasoline. The value of an equivalent amount of energy in natural gas to one gallon of NGLs is assumed to be 8.4% of the price of a MMBtu of natural gas at Henry Hub. 77 Table of Contents The following table presents selected average index prices for crude oil for the periods indicated: WTI Midland Houston LLS Crude Oil, Crude Oil, Crude Oil Crude Oil, $/barrel $/barrel $/barrel $/barrel (1) (2) (2) (3) 2018 by quarter: 1st Quarter $62.87 $62.51 $65.47 $65.79 2nd Quarter $67.88 $59.93 $72.38 $72.97 3rd Quarter $69.50 $55.28 $73.67 $74.28 4th Quarter $58.81 $53.64 $66.34 $66.20 2018 Averages $64.77 $57.84 $69.47 $69.81 2019 by quarter: 1st Quarter $54.90 $53.70 $61.19 $62.35 2nd Quarter $59.81 $57.62 $66.47 $67.07 3rd Quarter $56.45 $56.12 $59.75 $60.64 4th Quarter $56.96 $57.80 $60.04 $60.76 2019 Averages $57.03 $56.31 $61.86 $62.71 (1) WTI prices are based on commercial index prices at Cushing, Oklahoma as measured by the NYMEX. (2) Midland and Houston crude oil prices are based on commercial index prices as reported by Argus. (3) Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) prices are based on commercial index prices as reported by Platts. Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices, which fluctuate for a variety of reasons including supply and demand imbalances and geopolitical tensions. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.47 per gallon in 2019 compared to $0.70 per gallon in 2018. A decrease in our consolidated marketing revenues due to lower energy commodity sales prices may not result in a decrease in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also decrease due to comparable decreases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same type of correlation would be true in the case of higher energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs. We attempt to mitigate commodity price exposure through our hedging activities and the use of fee-based arrangements. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities. 78 Table of Contents Income Statement Highlights The following table summarizes the key components of our consolidated results of operations for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 Revenues $ 32,789.2 $ 36,534.2 Costs and expenses: Operating costs and expenses: Cost of sales 22,065.8 26,789.8 Other operating costs and expenses 3,020.7 2,898.7 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 1,848.3 1,687.0 Net gains attributable to asset sales (5.7 ) (28.7 ) Asset impairment and related charges 132.7 50.5 Total operating costs and expenses 27,061.8 31,397.3 General and administrative costs 211.7 208.3 Total costs and expenses 27,273.5 31,605.6 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 563.0 480.0 Operating income 6,078.7 5,408.6 Interest expense (1,243.0 ) (1,096.7 ) Change in fair value of Liquidity Option (119.6 ) (56.1 ) Other, net 16.6 43.0 Provision for income taxes (45.6 ) (60.3 ) Net income 4,687.1 4,238.5 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (95.8 ) (66.1 ) Net income attributable to limited partners $ 4,591.3 $ 4,172.4 Revenues The following table presents each business segment’s contribution to consolidated revenues for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 NGL Pipelines & Services: Sales of NGLs and related products $ 10,934.3 $ 12,920.9 Midstream services 2,536.4 2,728.0 Total 13,470.7 15,648.9 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services: Sales of crude oil 9,007.8 10,001.2 Midstream services 1,279.5 1,041.4 Total 10,287.3 11,042.6 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services: Sales of natural gas 2,075.4 2,411.7 Midstream services 1,094.0 1,042.7 Total 3,169.4 3,454.4 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services: Sales of petrochemicals and refined products 4,985.2 5,535.4 Midstream services 876.6 852.9 Total 5,861.8 6,388.3 Total consolidated revenues $ 32,789.2 $ 36,534.2 79 Table of Contents Total revenues for 2019 decreased $3.75 billion when compared to 2018 primarily due to a $3.87 billion decrease in marketing revenues. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs, petrochemicals and refined products decreased a combined net $2.54 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $4.7 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which resulted in a $2.16 billion increase. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil decreased $993.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $540.7 million decrease, and lower sales prices, which resulted in an additional $452.7 million decrease. In addition, revenues from the marketing of natural gas decreased a net $336.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices. Revenues from midstream services for 2019 increased $121.5 million when compared to 2018. Revenues from our pipeline assets increased $250.0 million year-to-year primarily due to strong demand for transportation services in Texas. Our Midland-to-ECHO 1 and 2 pipelines accounted for a combined $206.8 million of this increase. Revenue from our Mont Belvieu storage complex increased $94.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher storage, throughput and other fees. In addition, revenues from our terminal assets increased $75.8 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in loading volumes at EHT. Revenues from our natural gas plants decreased a net $285.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower revenues attributable to the equity NGLs we receive as non-cash consideration for processing services, which accounted for a $452.3 million decrease, partially offset by the addition of revenues from our recently completed Orla facility, which accounted for a $142.8 million increase. The year-to-year decline in revenues attributable to equity NGLs is primarily due to lower NGL prices in 2019 when compared to 2018. Largest customer information Substantially all of our consolidated revenues are earned in the U.S. and derived from a wide customer base. Our largest non-affiliated customer for 2019 and 2018 was Vitol Holding B.V. and its affiliates (collectively, “Vitol”), which accounted for 10.1% and 7.8%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Vitol is a global energy and commodity trading company. Operating costs and expenses Total operating costs and expenses for 2019 decreased $4.34 billion when compared to 2018 primarily due to lower cost of sales. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs, petrochemicals and refined products decreased a combined net $2.93 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $4.81 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $1.87 billion increase. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil decreased $1.37 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $924.1 million decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $446.9 million decrease. In addition, the cost of sales associated with our marketing of natural gas decreased $420.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices. Other operating costs and expenses for 2019 increased a net $122.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher chemical and maintenance expenses, ad valorem taxes, and employee compensation costs, which accounted for a combined $137.7 million increase. The higher costs for 2019 were partially offset by a $33.9 million charge recognized in 2018 in connection with an earnings allocation arrangement with an affiliate of Western Midstream Partners, LP (“WES”) involving the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $161.3 million year-to-year primarily due to assets placed into full or limited service since 2018 (e.g., the Shin Oak and Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipelines). Non-cash asset impairment charges increased $82.2 million year-to-year primarily due to the $76.4 million write-off of our equity method investment in Centennial Pipeline LLC and the planned shutdown of certain natural gas processing assets in Texas and Louisiana. General and administrative costs General and administrative costs for 2019 increased $3.4 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher employee-related costs partially offset by lower legal costs. 80 Table of Contents Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2019 increased $83.0 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to increased earnings from our investments in crude oil pipelines. Operating income Operating income for 2019 increased $670.1 million when compared to 2018 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Interest expense The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 1,251.6 $ 1,195.4 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization (1) 107.4 8.1 Interest costs capitalized in connection with construction projects (2) (143.8 ) (147.9 ) Other (3) 27.8 41.1 Total $ 1,243.0 $ 1,096.7 (1) Amounts presented for 2019 and 2018 includes $23.1 million and $29.4 million, respectively, of swaption premium income. See discussion below for information regarding an unrealized $94.9 million loss recorded in 2019 related to forward-starting interest rate swaps. (2) We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital investment levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. (3) Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs. Amount presented for 2018 includes $14.2 million of debt issuance costs that were written off in connection with the redemption of junior subordinated notes. Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is a key driver of interest expense, increased a net $56.2 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2019, which accounted for a $68.5 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates during 2019, which accounted for a $12.3 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2019 was $27.41 billion compared to $25.94 billion for 2018. In general, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital investments. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations and capital investments, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Capital Investments,” respectively, within this Part II, Item 7. In July 2019, we sold options to be put into forward-starting swaps (referred to as “swaptions”) if the market rate of interest fell below the strike rate of the option upon expiration of the derivative instrument. The premium we realized upon sale of these swaptions is reflected as a $13.3 million reduction in interest expense for 2019. Due to declining interest rates, the counterparties to these swaptions exercised their right to put us into ten forward-starting swaps on September 30, 2019 having an aggregate notional value of $1.0 billion. Since the swaptions were not designated as hedging instruments and were subject to mark-to-market accounting, we incurred an unrealized, mark-to-market loss at inception of the forward-starting swaps totaling $94.9 million that is reflected as an increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. The ten forward-starting swaps resulting from the swaption exercise on September 30, 2019 were designated as hedging instruments and are subject to cash flow hedge accounting. 81 Table of Contents Change in fair value of Liquidity Option We recognize non-cash expense in connection with accretion and changes in management estimates that affect our valuation of the Liquidity Option liability. Expense attributable to changes in the fair value of the Liquidity Option increased to $119.6 million in 2019 from $56.1 million in 2018. The higher level of expense recognized in 2019 is primarily due to a decrease in the discount factor used in determining the present value of the liability since December 31, 2018. The discount rate is based on a weighted-average cost of capital, which declined over the course of 2019 due to lower U.S. interest rates. The counterparty to the Liquidity Option exercised its rights under the option agreement on February 25, 2020. For additional information regarding the exercise, see “Exercise of Liquidity Option” under the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item 7. In addition, please refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Gain on step acquisition of unconsolidated affiliate We recognized a non-cash gain of $39.4 million during 2018 related to the step acquisition of Delaware Basin Gas Processing LLC (“Delaware Processing”). For information regarding this acquisition, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Income taxes Our provision for income taxes, which primarily reflects our state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (the “Texas Margin Tax”), decreased $14.7 million in 2019 when compared to 2018. Our partnership is not subject to U.S. federal income tax; however, our partners are individually responsible for paying federal income tax on their share of our taxable income. Business Segment Highlights We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The following table presents gross operating margin by segment and non-GAAP total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 Gross operating margin by segment: NGL Pipelines & Services $ 4,069.8 $ 3,830.7 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services 2,087.8 1,511.3 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 1,062.6 891.2 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services 1,069.6 1,057.8 Total segment gross operating margin (1) 8,289.8 7,291.0 Net adjustment for shipper make-up rights (24.1 ) 34.7 Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 8,265.7 $ 7,325.7 (1) Within the context of this table, total segment gross operating margin represents a subtotal and corresponds to measures similarly titled within our business segment disclosures found under Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 82 Table of Contents Total gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Total gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of gross operating margin may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment gross operating margin for NGL Pipelines & Services and Crude Oil Pipelines & Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights that are included in management’s evaluation of segment results. However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total gross operating margin. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income. For a discussion of operating income and its components, see the previous section titled “Consolidated Income Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income to total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 Operating income $ 6,078.7 $ 5,408.6 Adjustments to reconcile operating income to total gross operating margin(addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses 1,848.3 1,687.0 Asset impairment and related charges in operating costs and expenses 132.7 50.5 Net gains attributable to asset sales in operating costs and expenses (5.7 ) (28.7 ) General and administrative costs 211.7 208.3 Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 8,265.7 $ 7,325.7 Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. NGL Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 Segment gross operating margin: Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities $ 1,159.7 $ 1,240.1 NGL pipelines, storage and terminals 2,402.2 2,048.3 NGL fractionation 507.9 542.3 Total $ 4,069.8 $ 3,830.7 Selected volumetric data: NGL pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 3,615 3,461 NGL marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 626 593 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 1,017 945 Equity NGL production (MBPD) (1) 144 155 Fee-based natural gas processing (MMcf/d) (2) 5,282 4,831 (1) Represents the NGL volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities.

Expenses in 2018 for the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline included a $33.9 million charge attributable to the allocation of pipeline earnings to WES upon closing of their acquisition of a 20% ownership interest in Whitethorn Pipeline Company LLC (which owns the majority of the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline) in June 2018. Net to our interest, transportation volumes for the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline increased 43 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, which commenced operations in February 2019, was $99.9 million on transportation volumes of 197 MBPD. 85 Table of Contents Mark-to-market earnings attributable to the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline are associated with the hedging of crude oil market price differentials (basis spreads) between the Midland and Houston markets based on the pipeline’s capacity available to us during the hedged periods. These hedges served to lock in a positive per barrel margin on our anticipated purchases of crude oil at Midland and subsequent anticipated sales to customers in the Houston area. The mark-to-market loss in 2018 of $44.6 million reflected an increase in the basis spread between the Midland and Houston markets to an average of $8.48 per barrel through 2020 relative to our average hedged amount of $2.76 per barrel through 2020 (as of December 31, 2018). The mark-to-market gain in 2019 of $88.4 million reflected a decrease in the basis spread between the Midland and Houston markets since December 31, 2018 to an average of $1.81 per barrel through 2020 relative to our average hedged amount of $1.95 per barrel through 2020. At December 31, 2019, there were a limited number of these hedges outstanding.

Octane enhancement and related plant operations Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement facility and HPIB plants for 2019 increased an aggregate $11.9 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for a $26.4 million increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $13.9 million decrease. Additionally, our iBDH facility, which completed construction and was placed into service during December 2019, had a gross operating loss of $4.8 million, primarily due to start-up costs incurred prior to being placed into service. Refined products pipelines and related activities Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2019 increased $10.5 million when compared to 2018. 87 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline increased $18.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher deficiency fee revenues, which accounted for a $26.1 million increase, and higher average transportation fees, which accounted for an additional $8.9 million increase, partially offset by lower transportation volumes, which accounted for an $18.3 million decrease. Transportation volumes on the TE Products Pipeline decreased 79 MBPD primarily due to lower refined products and petrochemical product movements. Gross operating margin from refined products terminals associated with our TE Products Pipeline decreased $12.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating costs, which accounted for a $7.5 million decrease, and lower facility throughput fee revenues, which accounted for an additional $4.5 million decrease. Gross operating margin from our refined products marketing activities increased $9.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for an $18.7 million increase, partially offset by lower non-cash mark-to-market earnings, which accounted for an $8.9 million decrease. Non-cash mark-to-market earnings for this business was a loss of $7.2 million in 2019 compared to a $1.7 million gain in 2018. Gross operating margin from our refined products terminal in Beaumont, Texas decreased $11.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower storage revenues, which accounted for a $7.7 million decrease, and lower terminaling volumes of 23 MBPD, which accounted for an additional $3.3 million decrease. Marine transportation and other services Gross operating margin from marine transportation for 2019 increased $20.4 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher barge fees, which accounted for $31.8 million of the increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for an $11.3 million decrease. Liquidity and Capital Resources Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital investments and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. At December 31, 2019, we had $4.85 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $4.52 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $334.7 million of unrestricted cash on hand. We may issue equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital investments. We have a universal shelf registration statement (the “2019 Shelf”) on file with the SEC which allows EPD and EPO (each on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. The 2019 Shelf replaced our prior universal shelf registration statement, which expired in May 2019. Common Unit Buyback Program In January 2019, we announced that the Board of Enterprise GP had approved a $2.0 billion multi-year unit buyback program (the “2019 Buyback Program”), which provides EPD with an additional method to return capital to investors. The 2019 Buyback Program authorizes EPD to repurchase its common units from time to time, including through open market purchases and negotiated transactions. The timing and pace of buy backs under the program will be determined by a number of factors including (i) our financial performance and flexibility, (ii) organic growth and acquisition opportunities with higher potential returns on investment, (iii) EPD’s unit price and implied cash flow yield and (iv) maintaining targeted financial leverage with a debt-to-normalized adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of approximately 3.5 times. No time limit has been set for completion of the program, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. EPD repurchased 2,909,128 common units under the 2019 Buyback Program through open market purchases in 2019 (no repurchases were made during the third or fourth quarters of 2019). The total purchase price of these repurchases was $81.1 million, excluding commissions and fees. The repurchased units were cancelled immediately upon acquisition. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining available capacity under the 2019 Buyback Program was $1.92 billion. 88 Table of Contents As noted previously, management announced in January 2020 its intention to use approximately 2.0% of CFFO in 2020 to repurchase EPD common units under the 2019 Buyback Program. Exercise of Liquidity Option In October 2014, we acquired approximately 65.9% of the limited partner interests of Oiltanking Partners, L.P. (“Oiltanking”), all of the member interests of OTLP GP, LLC, the general partner of Oiltanking (“Oiltanking GP”), and the incentive distribution rights held by Oiltanking GP from Oiltanking Holding Americas, Inc. (“OTA”), a U.S. corporation, as the first step (“Step 1”) of a two-step acquisition of Oiltanking. In February 2015, we completed the second step of this transaction consisting of the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in Oiltanking. In order to fund the equity consideration paid in Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition, we issued 54,807,352 common units to OTA on October 1, 2014 in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof. We also entered into a put option agreement (the “Liquidity Option Agreement” or “Liquidity Option”) with OTA and Marquard & Bahls AG (“M&B”), a German corporation and the ultimate parent company of OTA, in connection with Step 1. Under the Liquidity Option Agreement, EPD granted M&B the option to sell to the partnership 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OTA at any time within a 90-day period commencing on February 1, 2020. On February 25, 2020, the partnership received notice from M&B of M&B’s election to exercise its Liquidity Option right. The Liquidity Option Agreement permits M&B to allow deferred tax liabilities to remain with OTA, including tax liabilities existing at the time of the sale of Oiltanking to us in 2014, and for M&B to directly receive EPD common units upon settlement of the Liquidity Option exercise that are unencumbered by any such liabilities. As a result, the liquidity of M&B is enhanced following exercise and settlement of the option, when compared to its financial position prior thereto (hence the name “Liquidity Option”). Under the terms of the Liquidity Option Agreement, the aggregate consideration to be paid by EPD for OTA’s capital stock at settlement will equal the volume-weighted sales price of EPD common units for the 10-trading day period immediately preceding the exercise notice date, multiplied by the 54,807,352 EPD common units owned by OTA. The consideration paid by the partnership may be in the form of newly issued EPD common units, cash or any mix thereof, as determined solely by EPD. Settlement of the option exercise transaction is expected to occur on March 5, 2020. The partnership currently expects that it will elect to deliver to M&B (or its designated affiliate) 54,807,352 newly issued EPD common units (in lieu of any cash) in connection with such settlement. The acquisition of OTA upon settlement of the Liquidity Option will be accounted for as the purchase of treasury units and the assumption of related deferred income taxes. Assuming that we issue only EPD common units to M&B as consideration (in lieu of any cash consideration), the number of EPD common units outstanding would not increase as the 54,807,352 newly issued units would be offset by the 54,807,352 EPD common units held by OTA that are reclassified to treasury units. For additional information regarding the Liquidity Option and the effects of the option exercise, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 89 Table of Contents Consolidated Debt The following table presents scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2019 for the years indicated (dollars in millions): Scheduled Maturities of Debt Total 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Principal amount of senior and junior debt obligations at December 31, 2019 $ 27,878.4 $ 1,982.0 $ 1,325.0 $ 1,400.0 $ 1,250.0 $ 850.0 $ 21,071.4 Issuance of $3.0 Billion of Senior Notes in January 2020 In January 2020, EPO issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2030 (“Senior Notes AAA”), (ii) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2051 (“Senior Notes BBB”) and (iii) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2060 (“Senior Notes CCC”). Net proceeds from this offering were used by EPO for the repayment of $500 million principal amount of its Senior Notes Q that matured in January 2020, temporary repayment of amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program and for general company purposes. In addition, net proceeds from this offering will be used by EPO for the repayment of $1.0 billion principal amount of its Senior Notes Y upon their maturity in September 2020. Senior Notes AAA were issued at 99.921% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 2.80% per year. Senior Notes BBB were issued at 99.413% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 3.70% per year. Senior Notes CCC were issued at 99.360% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 3.95% per year. EPD has guaranteed these senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis. Issuance of $2.5 Billion of Senior Notes in July 2019 In July 2019, EPO issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes due July 2029 (“Senior Notes YY”) and $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2050 (“Senior Notes ZZ”). Net proceeds from this offering were used by EPO for the repayment of debt and for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments. Senior Notes YY were issued at 99.955% of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 3.125% per year. Senior Notes ZZ were issued at 99.792% of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 4.20% per year. EPD has guaranteed these senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis. Amendment to Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement In September 2019, EPO entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to its revolving credit agreement dated September 13, 2017 (the “Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement”). The First Amendment reduces the borrowing capacity under the Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement from $4.0 billion to $3.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $500 million to $4.0 billion at EPO’s election provided certain conditions are met) and extends the maturity date to September 10, 2024, although the maturity date may be extended further at EPO’s request by up to two years, with the consent of required lenders as set forth under the credit agreement. Borrowings under this revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital investments, acquisitions and general company purposes. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement. 90 Table of Contents Renewal of 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement In September 2019, EPO entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement that replaced its prior 364-day credit facility. The new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures in September 2020. Under the terms of the new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $1.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $200 million to $1.7 billion at EPO’s election, provided certain conditions are met) at a variable interest rate for a term of up to 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. To the extent that principal amounts are outstanding at the maturity date, EPO may elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as non-revolving term loans for a period of one additional year, payable in September 2021. Borrowings under this revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital investments, acquisitions and general company purposes. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement. For additional information regarding our debt agreements, see Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report. Credit Ratings At February 28, 2020, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s, Baa1 from Moody’s and BBB+ from Fitch Ratings. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO’s short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor’s, P-2 from Moody’s and F-2 from Fitch Ratings. EPO’s credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. Issuance of Common Units The following table summarizes the issuance of new common units in connection with our distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) and employee unit purchase plan (“EUPP”) for the years indicated (dollars in millions, number of units issued as shown): Number ofCommonUnits Issued Net CashProceedsReceived Year Ended December 31, 2018: Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP 19,861,951 $ 538.4 Year Ended December 31, 2019: Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP (1) 2,897,990 $ 82.2 (1) The decrease in net cash proceeds from the DRIP and EUPP between 2018 and 2019 is primarily due to (i) lower reinvestments by privately held affiliates of EPCO in 2019, (ii) lower levels of reinvestment by participants due to a reduction in the DRIP discount from 2.5% to 0% beginning with the distribution paid in February 2019 and (iii) the election to satisfy delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP using common units purchased on the open market, rather than issuing new common units, beginning with the distribution paid in August 2019. Net cash proceeds from the issuance of new common units for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under EPO’s commercial paper program and for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments. 91 Table of Contents DRIP and EUPP EPD has registration statements on file with the SEC in connection with its DRIP and EUPP. The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional common units at a discount ranging from 0% to 5%. Beginning with the distribution declared with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017 and paid in February 2018, the DRIP discount was reduced from 5% to 2.5%. Likewise, beginning with the distribution declared with respect to the fourth quarter of 2018 and paid in February 2019, the DRIP discount was reduced from 2.5% to 0%. The EUPP provides employees of EPCO a voluntary means by which they can purchase our common units at a 10% discount through payroll deductions. We have the sole discretion to determine whether common units purchased under the DRIP and EUPP will come from our authorized but unissued common units or from common units purchased on the open market by the plan’s administrator. In July 2019, EPD announced that, beginning with the quarterly distribution payment paid in August 2019, it would use common units purchased on the open market, rather than issuing new common units, to satisfy its delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP. This election is subject to change in future quarters depending on the partnership’s need for equity capital. The preceding table shows the number of new common units issued to participants in the DRIP and EUPP during the two years ended December 31, 2019. A total of 2,801,196 additional common units were purchased on the open market in 2019 and delivered to participants in connection with the DRIP and EUPP. Other than amounts attributable to the plan discount available to all participants in the EUPP, the funds used to effect the open market purchases were sourced entirely from the DRIP and EUPP participants. No other partnership funds were used to satisfy these delivery obligations. We used open market purchases to fully satisfy DRIP and EUPP investments in connection with the distribution paid on February 12, 2020. After taking into account the number of common units delivered to participants under the DRIP and EUPP through December 31, 2019, we have the capacity to deliver an additional 56,320,229 and 4,596,585 common units, respectively, under these plans. ATM Program We have a registration statement on file with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $2.54 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings in connection with our ATM program. Pursuant to this program, we may sell common units from time-to-time under an equity distribution agreement between EPD and certain broker-dealers by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement. After taking into account the aggregate sales price of common units sold under the ATM program through December 31, 2019, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under the ATM program up to an aggregate sales price of $2.54 billion. We did not issue any common units under the ATM program during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. For additional information regarding our consolidated equity, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Cash Flow Statement Highlights The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 6,520.5 $ 6,126.3 Cash used in investing activities 4,575.5 4,281.6 Cash used in financing activities 1,945.1 1,504.9 92 Table of Contents Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. Changes in energy commodity prices may impact the demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemical and refined products, which could impact sales of our products and the demand for our midstream services. Changes in demand for our products and services may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels. We may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their obligations to us in connection with our marketing activities and long-term take-or-pay agreements. Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a major consideration in our businesses, and our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to sufficiently eliminate customer credit risk. We manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions may utilize letters of credit, prepayments, net out agreements and guarantees. However, these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk. We have a concentration of trade receivable balances due from independent and major integrated oil and gas companies and other pipelines and wholesalers. These concentrations may affect our overall credit risk in that these energy industry customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts: Operating activities Net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2019 increased a net $394.2 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to: • a $779.2 million year-to-year increase resulting from higher partnership earnings in 2019 when compared to 2018 (determined by adjusting our $448.6 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); and • an $88.6 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to investments in crude oil pipeline businesses; partially offset by • a $473.6 million year-to-year decrease primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations. For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see “Results of Operations” within this Part II, Item 7. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities in 2019 increased a net $293.9 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to: • a $308.5 million year-to-year increase in expenditures for consolidated property, plant and equipment (see “Capital Investments” within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information); and • a $140.6 million year-to-year decrease in proceeds from asset sales primarily due to the sale of our former Red River System in October 2018 for $134.9 million; partially offset by • a $150.6 million year-to-year decrease in net cash used for business combinations. We acquired a 50% equity interest in Delaware Processing in March 2018 for $150.6 million. 93 Table of Contents Financing activities Cash used in financing activities in 2019 increased $440.2 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to: • a $456.2 million year-to-year decrease in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units in connection with the DRIP and EUPP. As noted previously, EPD announced in July 2019 that, beginning with the quarterly distribution payment paid in August 2019, it would use common units purchased on the open market, rather than issuing new common units, to satisfy its delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP. Prior to this change, EPD issued an aggregate 2,897,990 common units, which generated $82.2 million of net cash proceeds, in connection with the DRIP and EUPP in 2019. This compares to an aggregate 19,861,951 common units, which generated $538.4 million of net cash proceeds, issued under these plans in 2018; • a net $175.5 million year-to-year decrease in net cash inflows from debt. During 2019, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, partially offset by the repayment or repurchase of $1.52 billion principal amount of senior and junior subordinated notes. During 2018, we issued $5.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior and junior subordinated notes, partially offset by the repayment of $2.3 billion in principal amount of such notes. In addition, net issuances of short term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program were $481.8 million in 2019 compared to net repayments of $1.75 billion in 2018; • a $112.9 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners primarily due to an increase in the quarterly cash distribution rate per unit; and • a $50.3 million year-to-year increase in cash used to acquire common units under our buyback programs; partially offset by • a $394.7 million year-to-year increase in cash contributions from noncontrolling interests. In July 2019, Altus acquired a 33% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns Shin Oak for $440.7 million. In June 2019, an affiliate of American Midstream, LP acquired a 25% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns the Pascagoula natural gas processing facility for $36.0 million in cash. In June 2018, WES acquired a 20% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns a majority of the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline for $189.6 million in cash. In addition, cash contributions from noncontrolling interests in connection with the construction of our ethylene export facility increased $43.5 million year-to-year. 94 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures Distributable Cash Flow Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business, including those for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash by the partnership allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets. In January 2020, the Board declared a cash distribution of $0.4450 per common unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, our management announced plans to recommend to the Board additional quarterly cash distribution increases of $0.0025 per unit with respect to each of the four quarters of 2020. For additional information regarding our expected distribution growth rate, see “Significant Recent Developments” within this Item 7. We measure available cash by reference to distributable cash flow (“DCF”), which is a non-GAAP cash flow measure. DCF is an important financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain our declared quarterly cash distributions. DCF is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships since the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Our management compares the DCF we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our distribution coverage ratio was approximately 1.7 times when compared to the sum of our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to fiscal 2019. Our calculation of DCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Based on the level of available cash each quarter, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board of Enterprise GP, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Unlike several other master limited partnerships, our general partner has a non-economic ownership interest in us and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from us based on incentive distribution rights or other equity interests. Our use of DCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. For a discussion of net cash flows provided by operating activities, see “Cash Flow Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. 95 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our calculation of DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 Net income attributable to limited partners (GAAP) (1) $ 4,591.3 $ 4,172.4 Adjustments to net income attributable to limited partners to derive DCF (addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 1,949.3 1,791.6 Cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates (2) 631.3 529.4 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates (563.0 ) (480.0 ) Asset impairment and related charges 132.8 50.5 Change in fair market value of derivative instruments 27.2 17.8 Change in fair value of Liquidity Option 119.6 56.1 Gain on step acquisition of unconsolidated affiliate – (39.4 ) Sustaining capital expenditures (3) (325.2 ) (320.9 ) Other, net 40.0 28.6 Subtotal DCF, before proceeds from asset sales and monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges 6,603.3 5,806.1 Proceeds from asset sales 20.6 161.2 Monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges – 22.1 DCF (non-GAAP) $ 6,623.9 $ 5,989.4 Cash distributions paid to limited partners with respect to period $ 3,887.0 $ 3,777.1 Cash distribution per unit declared by Enterprise GP with respect to period (4) $ 1.7650 $ 1.7250 Total DCF retained by partnership with respect to period (5) $ 2,736.9 $ 2,212.3 Distribution coverage ratio (6) 1.70 x 1.59 x (1) For a discussion of the primary drivers of changes in our comparative income statement amounts, see “Income Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. (2) Reflects both distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates and those attributable to a return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures include cash payments and accruals applicable to the period. (4) See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to the years indicated. (5) At the sole discretion of Enterprise GP, cash retained by the partnership with respect to each of these periods was primarily reinvested in growth capital projects. This retainage of cash substantially reduced our reliance on the equity capital markets to fund such expenditures. (6) Distribution coverage ratio is determined by dividing DCF by total cash distributions paid to limited partners and in connection with distribution equivalent rights with respect to the period. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by operating activities to DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 6,520.5 $ 6,126.3 Adjustments to reconcile net cash flows provided by operating activities to DCF (addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Net effect of changes in operating accounts 457.4 (16.2 ) Sustaining capital expenditures (325.2 ) (320.9 ) Distributions received for return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates 63.3 50.0 Proceeds from asset sales 20.6 161.2 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (95.8 ) (66.1 ) Monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges – 22.1 Other, net (16.9 ) 33.0 DCF (non-GAAP) $ 6,623.9 $ 5,989.4 96 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow (“FCF”), a non-GAAP financial measure, is a traditional cash flow metric that is widely used by a variety of investors and other participants in the financial community, as opposed to DCF, which is a cash flow measure primarily used by investors and others in evaluating master limited partnerships. In general, FCF is a measure of how much cash flow a business generates during a specified time period after accounting for all capital investments, including expenditures for growth and sustaining capital projects. By comparison, only sustaining capital expenditures are reflected in DCF. We believe that FCF is important to traditional investors since it reflects the amount of cash available for reducing debt, investing in additional capital projects, paying distributions, common unit repurchases and similar matters. Since business partners fund certain capital projects of our consolidated subsidiaries, our determination of FCF reflects the amount of cash contributed from and distributed to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of FCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of FCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. FCF fluctuates based on our earnings, the level of investing activities we undertake each period, and the timing of operating cash receipts and payments. The following table summarizes our calculation of FCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 6,520.5 $ 6,126.3 Adjustments to net cash flows provided by operating activities to derive FCF(addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Cash used in investing activities (4,575.5 ) (4,281.6 ) Cash contributions from noncontrolling interests 632.8 238.1 Cash distributions paid to noncontrolling interests (106.2 ) (81.6 ) FCF (non-GAAP) $ 2,471.6 $ 2,001.2 The elements used in calculating FCF are sourced directly from our statements of consolidated cash flows presented under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For a discussion of significant year-to-year changes in our cash flow statement amounts, see “Cash Flow Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. Capital Investments An important part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations, asset acquisitions, and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to expand our network of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production resulting from development activities in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and other domestic shale plays. Although our focus in recent years has been on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, asset acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. We placed $5.4 billion of major growth capital projects into service during 2019, including Shin Oak, Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, iBDH facility, Mentone I, Bulldog natural gas plant at our Carthage processing facility, expansion of LPG loading capacity at EHT, and our Morgan’s Point ethylene export terminal. At February 1, 2020, we had $7.7 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2023 including the following major projects: • two NGL fractionators in Chambers County, Texas (“Frac X,” first quarter of 2020; “Frac XI,” third quarter of 2020), • expansion of our Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline (second quarter of 2020): • the Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline (third through fourth quarters of 2020), 97 Table of Contents • expansion of our natural gas pipelines in northeast Texas in support of our Carthage natural gas processing facility (third quarter of 2020), • completion of the Baymark ethylene pipeline in South Texas (fourth quarter of 2020), • an eighth deep-water ship dock at EHT for loading crude oil (fourth quarter of 2020), • expansion of our ethylene export capabilities at Morgan’s Point (fourth quarter of 2020), • our Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline (second quarter of 2021), • expansion of our LPG and PGP export capabilities at EHT (second half of 2021), • expansion and extension of Acadian Gas System (Gillis Lateral and related projects) (third quarter of 2021), • addition of incremental capacity at our isomerization facility (first quarter of 2022), • construction of our PDH 2 facility (first quarter of 2023). Based on information currently available, we expect our total capital investments for 2020 to approximate $3.4 billion to $4.4 billion, which reflects growth capital investments of $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion and approximately $400 million for sustaining capital expenditures. For 2021, we anticipate our total capital investments in growth capital projects to approximate $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion. Our forecast of capital investments for 2020 and 2021 is based on announced strategic operating and growth plans (through the filing date of this annual report), which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital investments due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather-related issues and changes in supplier prices. Furthermore, our forecast of capital investments may change due to decisions made by management at a later date, which may include unforeseen acquisition opportunities. Our success in raising capital, including partnering with other companies to share project costs and risks, continues to be a significant factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we expect to make the forecast capital investments noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions. The following table summarizes our capital investments for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 Capital investments for property, plant and equipment: (1) Growth capital projects (2) $ 4,208.1 $ 3,902.3 Sustaining capital projects (3) 323.6 320.9 Total $ 4,531.7 $ 4,223.2 Cash used for business combinations, net $ – $ 150.6 Investments in unconsolidated affiliates $ 111.6 $ 113.6 (1) Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented on a cash basis. (2) Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. 98 Table of Contents Fluctuations in our investments in growth capital projects and investments in unconsolidated affiliates are explained in large part by increases or decreases in expenditures for major expansion projects. Our most significant growth capital investments for the year ended December 31, 2019 involve projects at our Mont Belvieu complex, crude oil pipelines in Texas and expansion projects involving our Gulf Coast export terminals. Fluctuations in investments in sustaining capital projects are explained in large part by the timing and cost of pipeline integrity and similar projects. Investments in growth capital projects at our Mont Belvieu complex increased $623.5 million year-to-year primarily due to construction activities surrounding Frac X and Frac XI, which accounted for a combined $479.0 million increase, our iBDH facility, which accounted for a $115.1 million increase, and expansion projects involving our DIBs, which accounted for an additional $87.2 million increase, partially offset by lower expenditures attributable to PDH 1 and Frac IX, which accounted for a combined $185.3 million decrease. PDH 1 and Frac IX were both placed into service during the second quarter of 2018. We placed our iBDH facility into service in December 2019. Investments in growth capital projects related to our ethylene business (e.g., pipelines, storage facilities and export terminal) increased $207.4 million year-to-year. Investments in growth capital projects in support of Permian Basin production decreased $532.1 million year-to-year primarily due to completion of Shin Oak, which accounted for a $524.4 million decrease, and Orla natural gas processing facility, which accounted for an additional $358.4 million decrease, partially offset by increased expenditures for the construction of Mentone I, which accounted for a $249.6 million increase. Shin Oak entered limited service in February 2019, with full capacity available in December 2019. Orla III entered service in July 2019 and Mentone I commenced operations in December 2019. Net cash used for business combinations during 2018 reflects our acquisition of a 50% member interest in Delaware Processing in March 2018. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following sections discuss the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies: Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Depreciation expense incorporates management estimates regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets into service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected salvage values or (iv) significant changes in our forecast of the remaining life for the associated resource basins, if applicable. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $41.6 billion and $38.74 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.56 billion and $1.44 billion of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 99 Table of Contents Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets, which consist of intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable through future cash flows. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals or refined products. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated residual values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset’s estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include the usage of probabilities when there is a range of possible outcomes. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate there is a potential loss in value of the investment attributable to an other than temporary decline. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances include continuing operating losses of the entity and/or long-term negative changes in the entity’s industry. In the event we determine that the value of an investment is not recoverable due to an other than temporary decline, we record a non-cash impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful lives of the investment’s underlying assets. A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any write-down of the carrying values of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. In 2019 and 2018, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to long-lived assets and equity method investments of $127.5 million and $46.8 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For additional information regarding impairment charges, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Valuation and Amortization Methods of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. The method used to value such assets depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns the asset is expected to generate. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to commercial relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. In certain instances, the acquisition of these intangible assets provides us with access to customers in a defined resource basin and is analogous to having a franchise in a particular area. Efficient operation of the acquired assets (e.g., a natural gas gathering system) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing producers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones within our existing asset footprint. The duration of this type of customer relationship is limited by the estimated economic life of the associated resource basin that supports the customer group. When estimating the economic life of a resource basin, we consider a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. 100 Table of Contents In other situations, the acquisition of a customer relationship intangible asset provides us with access to customers whose hydrocarbon volumes are not attributable to specific resource basins. As with basin-specific customer relationships, efficient operation of the associated assets (e.g., a marine terminal that handles volumes originating from multiple sources) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing customers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones. The duration of this type of customer relationship is typically limited to the term of the underlying service contracts, including assumed renewals. The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the estimated economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization period for a basin-specific customer relationship asset is limited by the estimated finite economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basin. Contract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the contract is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a marine terminal, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements. If our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset’s carrying value is not recoverable through its future cash flows, we would be required to reduce the asset’s carrying value to its estimated fair value through the recording of a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was $3.45 billion and $3.61 billion, respectively. We recorded $174.7 million and $170.3 million of amortization expense attributable to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our goodwill balance was $5.75 billion. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Goodwill is not amortized; however, we evaluate goodwill for impairment on December 31 of each year or when impairment indicators (e.g., the loss of a significant customer, adverse long-term supply or demand trends, or technological obsolescence of assets) are present. Testing goodwill for impairment involves a two-step process. As Step 1 of the process, if impairment indicators are present, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned is determined and compared to its carrying value. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the assets that comprise the reporting unit. These assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the assets classified within the reporting unit, which, in turn, rely on management’s estimates of long-term operating margins, throughput volumes and similar factors; (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. We believe that the assumptions we use in estimating reporting unit fair values are consistent with those that market participants would use in their fair value estimation process. As Step 2 of the process, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value (including associated goodwill), a non-cash impairment charge to earnings is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its implied fair value. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. 101 Table of Contents In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” This ASU simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 for future goodwill impairment testing. For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses As noted previously, preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect amounts presented in the financial statements. Due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions, we routinely employ estimates in connection with revenue and expense amounts in order to meet our accelerated financial reporting deadlines. Our most significant routine estimates involve revenues and costs of certain natural gas processing facilities, pipeline transportation revenues, fractionation revenues, marketing revenues and related purchases, and power and utility costs. These types of transactions must be estimated since the actual amounts are generally unavailable at the time we complete our accounting close process. The estimates subsequently reverse in the next accounting period when the corresponding actual customer billing or vendor-invoiced amounts are recorded. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates, which could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Prior to issuing our financial statements, we review our revenue and expense estimates based on currently available information to determine if adjustments are required. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. 102 Table of Contents Other Matters Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions): Payment or Settlement due by Period In less than In 1-3 In 4-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1) $ 27,878.4 $ 1,982.0 $ 2,725.0 $ 2,100.0 $ 21,071.4 Estimated cash payments for interest (2) 26,264.5 1,224.7 2,255.2 2,084.1 20,700.5 Operating lease obligations (3) 271.2 45.2 68.7 35.9 121.4 Purchase obligations: Product purchase commitments (4) 20,574.0 2,798.0 5,274.1 4,228.2 8,273.7 Service payment commitments (4,5) 335.7 66.6 117.4 57.8 93.9 Capital expenditure commitments (6) 45.8 45.8 – – – Other long-term liabilities (7) 860.8 – 76.8 45.8 738.2 Total contractual payment obligations $ 76,230.4 $ 6,162.3 $ 10,517.2 $ 8,551.8 $ 50,999.1 (1) Represents scheduled future maturities of our current and long-term debt principal obligations. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2019, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable interest rates. Our estimated cash payments for interest are influenced by the long-term maturities of our $2.65 billion in junior subordinated notes (due June 2067 through February 2078). The estimated cash payments assume that (i) the junior subordinated notes are not repaid prior to their respective maturity dates and (ii) the amount of interest paid on the junior subordinated notes is based on either (a) the current fixed interest rate charged or (b) the weighted-average variable rate paid in 2019, as applicable, for each note through the respective maturity date. (3) Primarily represents (i) land held pursuant to property leases, (ii) the lease of underground storage caverns for natural gas and NGLs, (iii) the lease of transportation equipment used in our operations and (iv) office space leased from affiliates of EPCO. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services as of December 31, 2019. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2019 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Primarily represents our unconditional payment obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts. (6) Represents unconditional payment obligations for services to be rendered or products to be delivered in connection with our capital expenditures, including our share of the capital expenditures of unconsolidated affiliates. (7) Primarily represents the Liquidity Option liability, the noncurrent portion of asset retirement obligations and deferred revenues. We expect that the Liquidity Option will be replaced with a long-term deferred tax liability of similar amount upon exercise of the Liquidity Option. For a discussion of the Liquidity Option and the effects of the option exercise, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. We are obligated to spend up to an aggregate $270 million over a ten-year period ending in 2025 on specified midstream gathering assets for certain producers utilizing our EFS Midstream System. If constructed, these new assets would be owned by us and be a component of the EFS Midstream System. As of December 31, 2019, we have spent $151 million of the $270 million commitment. Due to the uncertain timing of the remaining potential capital expenditures, we have excluded this amount from the preceding table. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Recent Accounting Developments For information regarding recent changes in our accounting for leases, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 103 Table of Contents Related Party Transactions For information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Insurance For information regarding insurance matters, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. General In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding and the discount rates used to determine the present values. The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming: • the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk; • the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and • the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period. We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. Accordingly, the nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. 104 Table of Contents Commodity Hedging Activities The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps and basis swaps. The following table summarizes our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2019 (volume measures as noted): Volume (1) Accounting Derivative Purpose Current (2) Long-Term (2) Treatment Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas processing: Forecasted natural gas purchases for plant thermal reduction (Bcf) 3.9 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs (MMBbls) 0.8 n/a Cash flow hedge Octane enhancement: Forecasted purchase of NGLs (MMBbls) 0.6 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of octane enhancement products (MMBbls) 11.2 0.1 Cash flow hedge Natural gas marketing: Forecasted purchases of natural gas (Bcf) 1.1 n/a Cash flow hedge Natural gas storage inventory management activities (Bcf) 3.0 n/a Fair value hedge NGL marketing: Forecasted purchases of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 103.5 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 128.1 n/a Cash flow hedge NGLs inventory management activities (MMBbls) 0.5 n/a Fair value hedge Refined products marketing: Forecasted purchases of refined products (MMBbls) 0.2 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of refined products (MMBbls) 0.2 n/a Cash flow hedge Crude oil marketing: Forecasted purchases of crude oil (MMBbls) 15.3 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of crude oil (MMBbls) 19.9 n/a Cash flow hedge Propylene marketing: Forecasted sales of NGLs for propylene marketing activities (MMBbls) 0.5 n/a Cash flow hedge Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas risk management activities (Bcf) (3) 52.3 0.2 Mark-to-market NGL risk management activities (MMBbls) (3) 6.5 n/a Mark-to-market Refined products risk management activities (MMBbls) (3) 9.4 n/a Mark-to-market Crude oil risk management activities (MMBbls) (3) 27.3 11.0 Mark-to-market (1) Volume for derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflects the total amount of volumes hedged whereas volume for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflects the absolute value of derivative notional volumes. (2) The maximum term for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is January 2021, April 2020 and December 2022, respectively. (3) Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with transportation, processing and storage assets. At December 31, 2019, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging natural gas processing margins and (iii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory. 105 Table of Contents Sensitivity Analysis The following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair values of our principal commodity derivative instrument portfolios at the dates indicated (dollars in millions). The fair value information presented in the sensitivity analysis tables excludes the impact of applying Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) Rule 814, which deems that financial instruments cleared by the CME are settled daily in connection with variation margin payments. As a result of this exchange rule, CME-related derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and subject to future commodity price fluctuations until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms. Derivative transactions cleared on exchanges other than the CME (e.g., the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE) continue to be reported on a gross basis.

This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. 106 Table of Contents Sensitivity Analysis With respect to the tabular data below, the portfolio’s estimated economic value at a given date is based on a number of factors, including the number and types of derivatives outstanding at that date, the notional value of the swaps and associated interest rates. At December 31, 2019, our interest rate hedging portfolio consisted of 12 forward-starting swaps. Forward-starting swaps hedge the risk of an increase in underlying benchmark interest rates during the period of time between the inception date of the swap agreement and the future date of a debt issuance. Under the terms of the forward-starting swaps, we pay to the counterparties (at the expected settlement dates of the instruments) amounts based on a fixed interest rate applied to a notional amount and receive from the counterparties an amount equal to a variable interest rate (based on LIBOR or an equivalent index rate) on the same notional amount. The following table summarizes our portfolio of forward-starting swaps at December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions).

See “Interest Rate Hedging Activities” under Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding the swaption exercise and related loss at inception. In January 2020, six forward-starting swaps having an aggregate notional amount of $575 million were terminated in connection with EPO’s issuance of $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. On January 31, 2020, we entered into two new forward-starting swaps (cash flow hedges) having an aggregate notional amount of $150 million, expected settlement dates in February 2022 and weighted-average fixed rates of approximately 1.7%. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated economic value of our forward-starting swap portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Forward-Starting SwapPortfolio Fair Value at Scenario ResultingClassification December 31,2018 December 31,2019 January 31,2020 Fair value assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) $ – $ (13.5 ) $ (67.8 ) Fair value assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) – 38.2 (38.9 ) Fair value assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Asset (Liability) – (68.3 ) (98.1 ) The $54.3 million change in the fair value of this portfolio from December 31, 2019 to January 31, 2020 was primarily due to declining interest rates relative to the fixed rates specified in the swap agreements. LIBOR phase-out The variable rates referenced in interest rate swap agreements often reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. announced a desire to phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. Financial industry working groups are developing replacement rates and methodologies to transition existing agreements that depend on LIBOR as a reference rate. We currently do not expect the transition from LIBOR to have a material impact on us. However, if clear market standards and transition methodologies have not developed by the time LIBOR becomes unavailable, we may have difficulty reaching agreement on acceptable replacement rates. If we are unable to negotiate replacement rates on favorable terms, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. 107 Table of Contents Product Purchase Obligations We have long-term purchase commitments for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products.

You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this annual report speak only as of the date hereof. Except as required by federal and state securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or any other reason. Overview of Business We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.” Our preferred units are not publicly traded. We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. We are owned by our limited partners (preferred and common unitholders) from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP, which owns a non-economic general partner interest in us, manages our Partnership. We conduct substantially all of our business operations through EPO and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our fully integrated, midstream energy asset network (or “value chain”) links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. Our midstream energy operations include: • natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; • NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and marine terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases, or “LPG,” and ethane); • crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and marine terminals; • propylene production facilities (including propane dehydrogenation (“PDH”) facilities), butane isomerization, octane enhancement, isobutane dehydrogenation (“iBDH”) and high purity isobutylene (“HPIB”) production facilities; • petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, and marine terminals (including those used to export ethylene and polymer grade propylene (“PGP”); and • a marine transportation business that operates on key U.S. inland and intracoastal waterway systems. The safe operation of our assets is a top priority. We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of the public and those working on our behalf by conducting our business activities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. For additional information, see “Environmental, Safety and Conservation” within the Regulatory Matters section of Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report. 65 Table of Contents Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the “ASA”) or by other service providers. Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measure, for us. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to certain risks. For information regarding such risks, see “Risk Factors” included under Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. Current Outlook As noted previously, this annual report on Form 10-K, including this update to our outlook on business conditions, contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs and those of our general partner, as well as assumptions made by us and information currently available to us, which includes forecast information published by third parties. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information” within this Part II, Item 7 and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, for additional information. The following information presents our current views on key midstream energy supply and demand fundamentals. The third-party supply and demand forecasts cited in the following discussion, including our internal forecasts based on such information, remain subject to significant uncertainty because mitigation and reopening efforts related to COVID-19, emerging variants of COVID-19 and the introduction of approved vaccines and proven therapeutics continue to evolve. All references to U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) forecasts and expectations are derived from its February 2021 Short-Term Energy Outlook (“February 2021 STEO”), which was published on February 9, 2021. Changes in the supply of and demand for hydrocarbon products impacts both the volume of products that we sell and the level of services that we provide to customers, which in turn has a direct impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The continued global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in the first quarter of 2020 and include the consequences of international COVID-19 containment measures (e.g., quarantines, travel restrictions, temporary business closures and similar protective actions), reduced near-term demand for hydrocarbon products by record amounts and created a significant oversupply situation. Also, in the early stages of the pandemic, disputes between members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and Russia (collectively, the “OPEC+” group) over crude oil production levels led to unprecedented volatility in global energy markets and a historic collapse in crude oil prices in April 2020. Although the OPEC+ group and other producers subsequently reached agreements to gradually reduce the oversupply of crude oil through production cuts, the downturn in the energy industry caused by lower demand and prices negatively impacted us, the producers we work with and our other customers to varying degrees. 66 Table of Contents Supply Side Observations Ongoing production cuts within the OPEC+ group, along with market-driven cuts in U.S., Brazilian and Canadian supplies, continue to provide much-needed support for international energy markets in coping with the ongoing weakness in hydrocarbon demand attributable to the pandemic. In April 2020, the OPEC+ group resolved their production dispute by agreeing to reduce their combined crude oil production by 9.7 MMBPD in May and June 2020, 9.6 MMBPD in July 2020, 7.7 MMBPD from August through December 2020, and 5.8 MMBPD from January 2021 to April 2022. In December 2020, the OPEC+ group revised their post-2020 production curtailments in light of current market dynamics and agreed to reduce their combined crude oil production by 7.2 MMBPD beginning in January 2021. The group will also hold monthly meetings to sign off on production adjustments for the following month, which would be no more than a 0.5 MMBPD increase. In addition, Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, said it would voluntarily reduce its production by 1.0 MMBPD in February and March in recognition of demand uncertainty related to the pandemic. The duration of market-driven production cuts by non-OPEC countries such as the U.S., Brazil and Canada will depend on supply and demand fundamentals. According to the February 2021 STEO, the EIA estimates that global production of petroleum and related liquids averaged 94.2 MMBPD in 2020, which represents a decline of 6.4 MMBPD when compared to 2019, and expects an average of 97.3 MMBPD in 2021 and 100.8 MMBPD in 2022. As a result of the current business environment, most crude oil producers in North America have significantly reduced their drilling and completion of new wells compared to prior years. Baker Hughes reported that the total number of drilling rigs working in the continental U.S. (combined crude oil and natural gas rigs) declined from 805 at December 27, 2019 to 265 at June 26, 2020. The U.S. drilling rig count stood at 266 on October 2, 2020, but increased to 392 by February 5, 2021 due to strengthening energy fundamentals. In its February 2021 STEO, the EIA estimates that U.S. crude oil production averaged 11.3 MMBPD in 2020, which is down from an average of 12.3 MMBPD in 2019. According to the February 2021 STEO, the EIA expects U.S. crude oil production to decline to an average of 10.9 MMBPD in the second quarter of 2021 since near-term drilling and completion activity will not generate enough production to offset declines from existing wells. The EIA expects drilling activity to rise later in 2021, contributing to U.S. crude oil production returning to an average of 11.2 MMBPD in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 11.0 MBPD for 2021. The EIA forecasts U.S. crude oil production to average 11.5 MMBPD in 2022. In its February 2021 STEO, the EIA estimates that U.S. natural gas production averaged 91.3 Bcf/d in 2020, which is down from an average of 93.1 Bcf/d in 2019. The EIA forecasts natural gas production to average 90.5 Bcf/d in 2021 and 91.0 Bcf/d in 2022. With the expected increase in U.S. crude oil production in late-2021, the EIA expects associated natural gas production from crude oil-directed wells to increase, especially in the Permian Basin region, and to average 90.5 Bcf/d in the fourth quarter of 2021. Demand Side Observations Across the globe, downstream demand for petroleum products such as gasoline and jet fuel has recovered from the lows of the second quarter of 2020, but remains depressed due to the effects of the pandemic and refiners have reduced their utilization rates in response. Many countries have eased their COVID-19 containment measures and central banks and governments have instituted fiscal measures in an effort to stimulate economic activity. As a result, hydrocarbon demand has started to recover; however, a continuation of this trend remains dependent on successful containment of the disease, the efficacy and distribution of approved vaccines on COVID-19 and its emerging variants, and proven therapeutics. In its February 2021 STEO, the EIA estimates that global demand for petroleum and related liquids averaged 92.3 MMBPD in 2020, and expects an average of 97.7 MMBPD in 2021 and 101.2 MMBPD in 2022. By contrast, the EIA estimates that global demand for petroleum and related liquids averaged 101.2 MMBPD in 2019 (pre-pandemic). 67 Table of Contents The decrease in hydrocarbon demand attributable to COVID-19 and the resulting oversupply situation caused a significant decrease in crude oil prices. Prior to the pandemic, crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) at Cushing, Oklahoma (as reported by the NYMEX) closed at $61.06 per barrel on December 31, 2019. By March 31, 2020, WTI prices closed at $20.48 per barrel and, notwithstanding the announced OPEC+ production cuts, closed at a record low of a negative $37.63 per barrel on April 20, 2020. As demand began to recover starting in the second quarter of 2020, WTI prices rebounded from the April lows and closed at $39.27 per barrel on June 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, WTI prices closed at $40.22 per barrel. At December 31, 2020, WTI prices closed at $48.52 per barrel as supply and demand fundamentals strengthened. Prices continue to increase as we begin 2021, averaging $52.10 per barrel in January 2021. In its February 2021 STEO, the EIA estimates that U.S. consumption of natural gas averaged 83.3 Bcf/d in 2020, which reflects a 2.2% decrease from the 2019 average of 85.2 Bcf/d. The EIA expects U.S. consumption of natural gas to decrease to an average of 81.7 Bcf/d in 2021 and 81.0 Bcf/d in 2022 due to rising natural gas prices, which are expected to negatively impact demand from the electric power sector. Natural gas prices, as measured by the NYMEX at Henry Hub and reported in the February 2021 STEO, averaged $2.03 per MMBtu in 2020 compared to an average of $2.57 per MMBtu in 2019. The EIA forecasts Henry Hub spot prices to increase to an average $2.95 per MMBtu in 2021 due to rising space heating demand and liquefied natural gas exports amid the overall decrease in U.S. natural gas production expected for 2021. The EIA expects Henry Hub spot prices to average $3.27 per MMBtu in 2022. Enterprise Outlook We believe that crude oil prices will continue to increase. Our view considers the record retrenchment in drilling and completion activities worldwide, including by U.S. producers in 2020, along with steep decline curves in shale basins that result in lower near-term production through mid-2021, and the expected continuing recovery of global hydrocarbon demand following the pandemic. However, in the interim, we believe the midstream industry will be challenged in its supply-side businesses and that challenges and opportunities will be different for each producing basin. Although the current industry and business outlooks remain challenging, we believe that our integrated, diversified and fee-based business model, will enable us to successfully traverse this difficult period. The Partnership and its consolidated operations remain in a strong position, with our financial strength and operational flexibility demonstrated by the following: • At December 31, 2020, we had $6.06 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $5.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $1.06 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. Our liquidity is supported by investment grade credit ratings on EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt of BBB+, Baa1 and BBB+ from Standard and Poors, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively. • EPO successfully issued $4.25 billion in principal amount of senior notes in 2020. Based on current conditions, we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and/or access to debt capital markets to fund the remaining principal amount of senior notes maturing through 2021. • In light of the current downturn in the domestic energy industry, we reevaluated our planned capital investments. Based on information currently available, we expect our total capital investments for 2021, net of contributions from joint venture partners, to approximate $2.1 billion, which reflects growth capital investments of $1.6 billion and sustaining capital expenditures of $440 million. In addition, we currently expect our growth capital investments in 2022 and 2023 for sanctioned projects to approximate $800 million and $400 million, respectively. These amounts do not include capital investments associated with our proposed deepwater offshore crude oil terminal (the Sea Port Oil Terminal or “SPOT”), which remains subject to governmental approvals. We currently anticipate receiving approval for SPOT as early as the third quarter of 2021; however, we can give no assurance as to whether the project will ultimately be approved or the timing of such decision. 68 Table of Contents • We continue to optimize our assets to provide incremental services to customers and to respond to market opportunities. As prices for certain NGLs, crude oil and refined products fell in 2020 due to collapsing demand for refined products as a result of the pandemic, our storage services provided valuable flexibility for our customers. In addition, our earnings from marketing activities in 2020 benefited from using uncontracted storage capacity to capture contango opportunities in NGLs, crude oil and refined products. • Across all of our assets, we have contracted with a large number of quality customers in order to achieve customer diversification. In 2020, our top 200 largest customers represented 95.3% of consolidated revenues. Based on their respective year-end 2020 debt ratings, 81.4% of our top 200 customers were either investment grade rated or backed by letters of credit. Additionally, only 8.1% of our top 200 customer revenues were attributable to sub-investment grade or non-rated upstream producers. In light of current events, we are closely monitoring the recoverability of our long-lived assets for potential impairment. We recognized a combined $890.6 million of non-cash asset impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2020. If the adverse economic impacts of the pandemic persist for longer periods than currently expected, these developments could result in our recognition of additional non-cash impairment charges in the future. Significant Recent Developments Enterprise and Magellan to Develop Joint Houston Crude Oil Futures Contract In January 2021, we and Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P (“Magellan”) announced that our affiliates had entered into an agreement to jointly develop a futures contract for the physical delivery of crude oil in the Houston, Texas area in response to market interest for a Houston-based index with greater scale, flow assurance and price transparency. The quality specifications will be consistent with WTI crude oil originating from the Permian Basin with delivery capabilities at either our ECHO terminal in Houston or Magellan’s East Houston terminal. Ethylene Export Terminal Enters Full Service In December 2020, our ethylene export terminal located at our Morgan’s Point facility on the Houston Ship Channel entered full service with the commissioning of a refrigerated storage tank capable of handling 66 million pounds of ethylene. The ethylene export terminal, which had been in limited service since December 2019, features two docks and a nameplate capacity to load 1 million tons of ethylene per year. Ethylene is the primary feedstock for a wide variety of consumer products, including cell phones and computer parts, food packaging, apparel, textiles and personal protective equipment. We own a 50% member interest in Enterprise Navigator Ethylene Terminal LLC, which owns the export facility. Our ethylene system serves as an open market storage and trading hub for the ethylene industry by incorporating storage capacity, connections to multiple ethylene pipelines, and high-volume export capabilities. In support of our ethylene business, our Mont Belvieu storage operations include a high-capacity underground ethylene storage well having a storage capacity of 600 million pounds of ethylene. The storage well is connected to our Morgan’s Point ethylene export terminal and further to Bayport, Texas by a 27-mile pipeline. Enterprise Joins The Alliance To End Plastic Waste In December 2020, we became the first midstream company member of The Alliance to End Plastic Waste (the “Alliance”), which represents an international community of chief executive officers from across the plastic industry that are committed to addressing the global plastic waste challenge. Formed in 2019, the Alliance partners with a diverse and growing network of organizations, technical leaders, engineers and scientists, all dedicated to the goal of ending plastic waste. To achieve this goal, the Alliance focuses on four strategic areas – infrastructure, innovation, education and clean up – to unlock innovative solutions that will bring the world closer to the Alliance’s ambition of diverting millions of tons of plastic waste in more than 100 at-risk cities across the globe by 2025. 69 Table of Contents Expansion of Midland-to-ECHO System Enters Service In July 2019, we announced a third expansion of our Midland-to-ECHO System comprised of a 36-inch pipeline extending from Midland, Texas to our Enterprise Crude Houston (“ECHO”) terminal, and further from ECHO to a third-party terminal in Webster, Texas (collectively, the “Midland-to-Webster pipeline”). We proportionately consolidate a 29% undivided interest in the Midland-to-Webster pipeline, which we refer to as the “Midland-to-ECHO 3” pipeline. In October 2020, we announced that the Midland-to-ECHO segment was placed into service. The ECHO-to-Webster segment was mechanically complete in December 2020. Once all facilities are placed into full commercial service, our maximum transportation capacity on the pipeline is expected to approximate 450 MBPD. Amendments to Crude Oil Transportation Agreements; Cancellation of Midland-to-ECHO 4 Pipeline In September 2020, we announced the amendment of certain crude oil transportation agreements and the related cancellation of the Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline. In general, the amendments provide for the reduction of near-term pipeline volume commitments in exchange for extending the term of the related transportation agreements and using existing pipeline infrastructure. Cancellation of the Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline reduced our growth capital investments by an aggregate $800 million over the years 2020 through 2022. As a result of the cancellation, we recorded an impairment charge of $42.2 million. Execution of Long-Term PGP Sales Agreement in Support of PDH 2 Facility In June 2020, we announced the execution of a long-term sales agreement with Marubeni Corporation to supply PGP from our second propane dehydrogenation plant (“PDH 2”), which is currently under construction at our Mont Belvieu complex. Marubeni Corporation is a major Japanese integrated trading and investment business conglomerate and the world’s largest olefins trader. PGP is a primary petrochemical that has global demand growth as a feedstock to manufacture consumer, medical and industrial products that improve the daily lives and protect the health of people around the world. PDH 2 is expected to have the capacity to upgrade 35 MBPD of propane into 1.65 billion pounds per year (equivalent to 25 MBPD) of PGP and begin service in the second quarter of 2023. Once PDH 2 is placed into service and integrated with PDH 1 and our other propylene production facilities, we will have the capability to produce 11 billion pounds of propylene per year. 70 Table of Contents Selected Energy Commodity Price Data The following table presents selected average index prices for natural gas and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods indicated: Polymer Refinery Indicative Gas Natural Normal Natural Grade Grade Processing Gas, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Gasoline, Propylene, Propylene, Gross Spread $/MMBtu $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/pound $/pound $/gallon (1) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (3) (3) (4) 2019 by quarter: 1st Quarter $3.15 $0.30 $0.67 $0.82 $0.85 $1.16 $0.38 $0.24 $0.31 2nd Quarter $2.64 $0.21 $0.55 $0.63 $0.65 $1.21 $0.37 $0.24 $0.25 3rd Quarter $2.23 $0.17 $0.44 $0.51 $0.66 $1.06 $0.38 $0.23 $0.21 4th Quarter $2.50 $0.19 $0.50 $0.68 $0.82 $1.20 $0.35 $0.21 $0.25 2019 Averages $2.63 $0.22 $0.54 $0.66 $0.75 $1.16 $0.37 $0.23 $0.26 2020 by quarter: 1st Quarter $1.95 $0.14 $0.37 $0.57 $0.63 $0.93 $0.31 $0.18 $0.19 2nd Quarter $1.71 $0.19 $0.41 $0.43 $0.44 $0.41 $0.26 $0.11 $0.17 3rd Quarter $1.98 $0.22 $0.50 $0.58 $0.60 $0.80 $0.35 $0.17 $0.25 4th Quarter $2.67 $0.21 $0.57 $0.76 $0.68 $0.92 $0.41 $0.24 $0.22 2020 Averages $2.08 $0.19 $0.46 $0.59 $0.59 $0.77 $0.33 $0.18 $0.21 (1) Natural gas prices are based on Henry-Hub Inside FERC commercial index prices as reported by Platts, which is a division of McGraw Hill Financial, Inc. (2) NGL prices for ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane and natural gasoline are based on Mont Belvieu Non-TET commercial index prices as reported by Oil Price Information Service. (3) Polymer grade propylene prices represent average contract pricing for such product as reported by IHS Chemical, a division of IHS Inc. (“IHS Chemical”). Refinery grade propylene (“RGP”) prices represent weighted-average spot prices for such product as reported by IHS Chemical. (4) The “Indicative Gas Processing Gross Spread” represents our generic estimate of the gross economic benefit from extracting NGLs from natural gas production based on certain pricing assumptions. Specifically, it is the amount by which the assumed economic value of a composite gallon of NGLs at Mont Belvieu, Texas exceeds the value of the equivalent amount of energy in natural gas at Henry Hub, Louisiana. Our estimate of the indicative spread does not consider the operating costs incurred by a natural gas processing facility to extract the NGLs nor the transportation and fractionation costs to deliver the NGLs to market. In addition, the actual gas processing spread earned at each plant is determined by regional pricing and extraction dynamics. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.38 per gallon in 2020 versus $0.47 per gallon for 2019. 71 Table of Contents The following table presents selected average index prices for crude oil for the periods indicated: WTI Midland Houston LLS Crude Oil, Crude Oil, Crude Oil Crude Oil, $/barrel $/barrel $/barrel $/barrel (1) (2) (2) (3) 2019 by quarter: 1st Quarter $54.90 $53.70 $61.19 $62.35 2nd Quarter $59.81 $57.62 $66.47 $67.07 3rd Quarter $56.45 $56.12 $59.75 $60.64 4th Quarter $56.96 $57.80 $60.04 $60.76 2019 Averages $57.03 $56.31 $61.86 $62.71 2020 by quarter: 1st Quarter $46.17 $45.51 $47.81 $48.15 2nd Quarter $27.85 $28.22 $29.68 $30.12 3rd Quarter $40.93 $41.05 $41.77 $42.47 4th Quarter $42.66 $43.07 $43.63 $44.08 2020 Averages $39.40 $39.46 $40.72 $41.21 (1) WTI prices are based on commercial index prices at Cushing, Oklahoma as measured by the NYMEX. (2) Midland and Houston crude oil prices are based on commercial index prices as reported by Argus. (3) Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) prices are based on commercial index prices as reported by Platts. Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices. Energy commodity prices in 2020 fluctuated significantly due to the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and, with respect to crude oil prices in early 2020, the production dispute between Saudi Arabia and Russia. See “Current Outlook” within this Part II, Item 7 for information regarding these recent events. A decrease in our consolidated marketing revenues due to lower energy commodity sales prices may not result in a decrease in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also decrease due to comparable decreases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same type of correlation would be true in the case of higher energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs. We attempt to mitigate commodity price exposure through our hedging activities and the use of fee-based arrangements. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities. 72 Table of Contents Income Statement Highlights The following table summarizes the key components of our consolidated results of operations for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 Revenues $ 27,199.7 $ 32,789.2 Costs and expenses: Operating costs and expenses: Cost of sales 16,723.2 22,065.8 Other operating costs and expenses 2,800.2 3,020.7 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 1,961.5 1,848.3 Net gains attributable to asset sales (4.4 ) (5.7 ) Asset impairment and related charges 890.6 132.7 Total operating costs and expenses 22,371.1 27,061.8 General and administrative costs 219.6 211.7 Total costs and expenses 22,590.7 27,273.5 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 426.1 563.0 Operating income 5,035.1 6,078.7 Interest expense (1,287.4 ) (1,243.0 ) Change in fair value of Liquidity Option (2.3 ) (119.6 ) Other, net 16.0 16.6 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes 124.3 (45.6 ) Net income 3,885.7 4,687.1 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (110.1 ) (95.8 ) Net income attributable to preferred units (0.9 ) – Net income attributable to common unitholders $ 3,774.7 $ 4,591.3 Revenues The following table presents each business segment’s contribution to consolidated revenues for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 NGL Pipelines & Services: Sales of NGLs and related products $ 8,970.7 $ 10,934.3 Midstream services 2,206.5 2,536.4 Total 11,177.2 13,470.7 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services: Sales of crude oil 5,410.8 9,007.8 Midstream services 1,278.2 1,279.5 Total 6,689.0 10,287.3 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services: Sales of natural gas 1,530.5 2,075.4 Midstream services 1,022.6 1,094.0 Total 2,553.1 3,169.4 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services: Sales of petrochemicals and refined products 5,942.6 4,985.2 Midstream services 837.8 876.6 Total 6,780.4 5,861.8 Total consolidated revenues $ 27,199.7 $ 32,789.2 73 Table of Contents Total revenues for 2020 decreased $5.59 billion when compared to 2019 primarily due to a net $5.15 billion decrease in marketing revenues. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil and natural gas decreased $4.14 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower average sales prices, which accounted for a $3.27 billion decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $867.8 million decrease. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs decreased a net $1.96 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower average sales prices, which accounted for a $3.16 billion decrease, partially offset by the effects of higher sales volumes, which resulted in a $1.2 billion increase. Revenues from the marketing of petrochemicals and refined products increased a net $957.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $2.05 billion increase, partially offset by lower average sales prices, which resulted in a $1.1 billion decrease. Revenues from midstream services for 2020 decreased $441.4 million when compared to 2019. Revenues from our natural gas processing facilities decreased $229.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower market values for the equity NGLs we receive as non-cash consideration for processing services. Revenues from our Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, which commenced limited service in February 2019 and full service in April 2019 and Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline, which commenced service in October 2020, increased a combined $49.6 million year-to-year. Revenues from our other pipeline assets decreased $179.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products transportation services. Lastly, revenues from our Mont Belvieu-area NGL fractionators decreased $82.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower fractionation fees. For additional information regarding our revenues, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Operating costs and expenses Total operating costs and expenses for 2020 decreased $4.69 billion when compared to 2019 primarily due to lower cost of sales. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil and natural gas decreased a combined $3.83 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower average purchase prices, which accounted for a $3.19 billion decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $634.4 million decrease. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs decreased a net $2.25 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower average purchase prices, which accounted for a $3.22 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $970.7 million increase. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of petrochemicals and refined products increased a net $736.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $1.81 billion increase, partially offset by lower average purchase prices, which accounted for a $1.07 billion decrease. Other operating costs and expenses for 2020 decreased $220.5 million year-to-year primarily due to lower maintenance, chemicals and power-related expenses, which accounted for a $282.2 million decrease, partially offset by higher ad valorem taxes and employee compensation costs, which accounted for a $50.2 million increase. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $113.2 million year-to-year primarily due to assets placed into full or limited service since the first quarter of 2019 (e.g., the iBDH plant, Mentone and Orla gas processing facilities, Fracs X and XI and the Enterprise Navigator ethylene terminal). Non-cash asset impairment charges increased $757.9 million year-to-year primarily due to the recognition in 2020 of the full impairment of goodwill associated with our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services business segment, which accounted for $296.3 million of expense, the partial impairment of our marine transportation business, which accounted for $256.7 million of expense, and the partial impairment of natural gas gathering and processing assets in South Texas, which accounted for an additional $125.7 million of expense. For information regarding these charges, see Notes 2, 4 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. General and administrative costs General and administrative costs for 2020 increased $7.9 million when compared to 2019 primarily due to higher professional services and employee compensation costs. 74 Table of Contents Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2020 decreased $136.9 million when compared to 2019 primarily due to decreased earnings from our investments in crude oil pipelines. Operating income Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $1.04 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Interest expense The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 1,330.6 $ 1,251.6 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization (1) 39.3 107.4 Interest costs capitalized in connection with construction projects (2) (115.0 ) (143.8 ) Other (3) 32.5 27.8 Total $ 1,287.4 $ 1,243.0 (1) Amount presented for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects an unrealized, mark-to-market loss of $94.9 million recognized in September 2019 in connection with the exercise of swaptions. Due to declining interest rates, the counterparties to the swaptions exercised their right to put us into ten forward-starting swaps in September 2019 having an aggregate notional value of $1.0 billion. Since the swaptions were not designated as hedging instruments and were subject to mark-to-market accounting, we incurred an unrealized, mark-to-market loss at inception of the forward-starting swaps that is reflected as an increase in interest expense in 2019. The ten forward-starting swaps resulting from the swaption exercise were designated as hedging instruments and qualified for cash flow hedge accounting. (2) We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital investment levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. (3) Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is a key driver of interest expense, increased a net $79.0 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2020, which accounted for a $109.2 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates during 2020, which accounted for a $30.2 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2020 was $29.91 billion compared to $27.41 billion for 2019. In general, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital investments. For information regarding our debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Change in fair value of Liquidity Option On February 25, 2020, we received notice from Marquard & Bahls AG (“M&B”) of M&B’s election to exercise its rights (the “Liquidity Option”) under the Liquidity Option Agreement among the Partnership, OTA Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation previously named Oiltanking Holding Americas, Inc. (“OTA”), and M&B dated October 1, 2014 (the “Liquidity Option Agreement”). The Partnership settled its obligations under the Liquidity Option Agreement on March 5, 2020. 75 Table of Contents For the period in which the Liquidity Option was outstanding, we recognized non-cash expense in connection with accretion and changes in management estimates that affected the valuation of the Liquidity Option liability. Expense amounts attributable to changes in the fair value of the Liquidity Option were $2.3 million and $119.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The expense recognized for 2020 primarily reflects accretion expense for the period in which the Liquidity Option liability was outstanding before it was settled on March 5, 2020. The higher level of expense recognized in 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in the discount factor used in determining the present value of the liability. For additional information regarding the exercise, see “Issuance of Common Units due to Settlement of Liquidity Option in March 2020” within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Part II, Item 7. In addition, please refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Income taxes The following table presents the components of our consolidated benefit from (provision for) income taxes for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 Deferred tax benefit attributable to OTA $ 155.3 Texas Margin Tax (32.1 ) $ (44.2 ) Other 1.1 (1.4 ) Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $ 124.3 $ (45.6 ) On March 5, 2020, the Partnership settled its obligations under the Liquidity Option Agreement and indirectly assumed the deferred tax liability of OTA, which reflects OTA’s outside basis difference in the limited partner interests it received from the Partnership in October 2014. Upon settlement of the Liquidity Option, the Liquidity Option liability was effectively replaced by the deferred tax liability of OTA calculated in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. At March 5, 2020, the Liquidity Option liability amount was $511.9 million. Since the book value of the Liquidity Option liability exceeded OTA’s estimated deferred tax liability of $439.7 million on that date, we recognized a non-cash benefit in earnings of $72.2 million, which is reflected in the “Benefit from (provision for) income tax” line on our Statement of Consolidated Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. OTA recognized an additional net, non-cash deferred income tax benefit of $83.1 million primarily due to a decrease in the outside basis difference of its investment in the Partnership attributable to a decline in the market price of the Partnership’s common units subsequent to March 5, 2020 through September 30, 2020. In total, our earnings for 2020 reflect $155.3 million of deferred income tax benefit attributable to OTA. On September 30, 2020, OTA exchanged the Partnership common units it owned for non-publicly traded preferred units having a stated value of $1,000 per unit. As a result and beginning September 30, 2020, OTA’s deferred tax liability no longer fluctuates due to market price changes in our common units. For information regarding the issuance of preferred units on September 30, 2020, including the OTA-related exchange, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within this Part II, Item 7. For information regarding our income taxes, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Business Segment Highlights We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. 76 Table of Contents The following table presents gross operating margin by segment and non-GAAP total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 Gross operating margin by segment: NGL Pipelines & Services $ 4,182.4 $ 4,069.8 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services 1,997.3 2,087.8 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 926.6 1,062.6 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services 1,081.8 1,069.6 Total segment gross operating margin (1) 8,188.1 8,289.8 Net adjustment for shipper make-up rights (85.7 ) (24.1 ) Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 8,102.4 $ 8,265.7 (1) Within the context of this table, total segment gross operating margin represents a subtotal and corresponds to measures similarly titled within our business segment disclosures found under Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Total gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Total gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of gross operating margin may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment gross operating margin for NGL Pipelines & Services and Crude Oil Pipelines & Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights that are included in management’s evaluation of segment results. However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total gross operating margin. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income. For a discussion of operating income and its components, see the previous section titled “Income Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income to total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 Operating income $ 5,035.1 $ 6,078.7 Adjustments to reconcile operating income to total gross operating margin(addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses 1,961.5 1,848.3 Asset impairment and related charges in operating costs and expenses 890.6 132.7 Net gains attributable to asset sales in operating costs and expenses (4.4 ) (5.7 ) General and administrative costs 219.6 211.7 Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 8,102.4 $ 8,265.7 Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin for us. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower energy commodity prices, we experienced a reduction in volumes on a number of our assets (e.g., our crude oil pipelines and export docks and natural gas gathering systems) during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to reduced upstream drilling and production activity and lower downstream refinery activity and demand for transportation fuels. Furthermore, we may continue to experience throughput declines in the future on our gathering systems, long-haul liquids and natural gas pipelines and at our terminal and other facilities until the pandemic ends and economic activity is fully restored. For a general discussion of the impact of the pandemic on our partnership and industry, see “Current Outlook” within this Part II, Item 7. 77 Table of Contents NGL Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 Segment gross operating margin: Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities $ 997.5 $ 1,159.7 NGL pipelines, storage and terminals 2,524.1 2,402.2 NGL fractionation 660.8 507.9 Total $ 4,182.4 $ 4,069.8 Selected volumetric data: NGL pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 3,589 3,615 NGL marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 722 626 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 1,359 1,017 Equity NGL production volumes (MBPD) (1) 151 144 Fee-based natural gas processing volumes (MMcf/d) (2, 3) 4,285 4,738 (1) Represents the NGL volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities.

Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $162.2 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing facilities located in the Rocky Mountains (Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco plants) decreased a combined $94.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities). On a combined basis, fee-based natural gas processing volumes at these plants decreased 319 MMcf/d year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our South Texas natural gas processing facilities decreased $90.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $51.2 million decrease, lower average processing fees, which accounted for a $23.9 million decrease, and lower processing volumes, which accounted for an additional $12.8 million decrease. On a combined basis, fee-based natural gas processing volumes at these plants decreased 156 MMcf/d and equity NGL production volumes increased 5 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas processing facilities decreased a net $32.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $33.4 million decrease, and lower processing volumes, which accounted for an additional $17.9 million decrease, partially offset by lower operating costs, which accounted for a $10.7 million increase, and higher average processing fees, which accounted for an additional $9.5 million increase. Net to our interest, fee-based natural gas processing and equity NGL production volumes at these plants decreased a combined 389 MMcf/d and 8 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Permian Basin natural gas processing facilities decreased a net $18.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $42.5 million decrease, and lower average processing fees, which accounted for an additional $25.2 million decrease, partially offset by higher processing volumes, which accounted for a $54.8 million increase. On a combined basis, fee-based natural gas processing and equity NGL production volumes at our Permian Basin plants increased 363 MMcf/d and 8 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year, primarily due to additional processing capacity at our Orla facility that was placed into service in July 2019 and the start-up of our Mentone facility in December 2019. 78 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased a net $71.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $248.9 million increase, partially offset by lower average sales margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $177.7 million decrease. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin can be attributed to results from marketing strategies that seek to optimize our storage assets, which accounted for a $123.7 million increase, partially offset by lower earnings from strategies that seek to optimize our export, plant and transportation assets, which accounted for a combined $98.2 million decrease. In addition, gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities attributable to non-cash, mark-to-market earnings increased $46.0 million year-to-year. NGL pipelines, storage and terminals Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines, storage and terminal assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $121.9 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. A number of our pipelines, including the Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole NGL Pipeline, Chaparral NGL Pipeline, Shin Oak NGL Pipeline, Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline, serve Permian Basin and/or Rocky Mountain producers. On a combined basis, gross operating margin from these pipelines increased a net $65.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average transportation fees, which accounted for a $64.9 million increase, and lower operating costs, which accounted for an additional $36.4 million increase, partially offset by lower transportation volumes of 101 MBPD (net to our interest), which accounted for a $25.9 million decrease. Gross operating margin from LPG-related activities at EHT increased $62.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher export volumes of 105 MBPD. The increase in export volumes is attributable to an LPG expansion project at EHT that was completed in the third quarter of 2019. Gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel Pipeline System increased $21.5 million year-to-year primarily due to an 86 MBPD increase in transportation volumes. Gross operating margin at our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal increased $8.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower operating costs. Export volumes from our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal decreased 9 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Aegis Pipeline increased a net $27.3 million year-to-year primarily due to a 107 MBPD increase in transportation volumes associated with contract commitments, which accounted for a $43.0 million increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for a $9.5 million decrease. Gross operating margin from our South Louisiana NGL Pipeline System and related storage facilities decreased a combined $22.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower transportation volumes of 60 MBPD, which accounted for an $11.9 million decrease, and lower terminal revenues, which accounted for an additional $6.0 million decrease. Gross operating margin from our Lou-Tex NGL Pipeline decreased $8.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower transportation volumes of 24 MBPD. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu storage facility decreased a net $16.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower handling and throughput fee revenues, which accounted for a $45.6 million decrease, partially offset by higher storage fees, which accounted for a $32.1 million increase. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System decreased $11.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower pipeline capacity fee revenues earned from an affiliate pipeline. Transportation volumes on our South Texas NGL Pipeline System increased 15 MBPD year-to-year. NGL fractionation Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation during the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $152.9 million when compared to the year ended December 31 2019. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu-area NGL fractionators increased $123.9 million primarily due to higher fractionation volumes, which increased 353 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest) primarily due to the start-up of Frac X and Frac XI in March 2020 and September 2020, respectively. Gross operating margin from our Hobbs NGL fractionator increased $20.2 million year-to-year primarily due to major maintenance activities completed in the first quarter of 2019.

Gross operating margin from our Haynesville Gathering System decreased $19.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower gathering volumes of 211 BBtus/d, which accounted for a $14.4 million decrease, and lower average gathering fees, which accounted for an additional $4.9 million decrease. On a combined basis, gross operating margin from our Jonah Gathering System, Piceance Basin Gathering System, and San Juan Gathering System in the Rocky Mountains decreased a net $17.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower volumes of 492 BBtus/d, which accounted for a $44.9 million decrease, partially offset by higher average fees, which accounted for a $22.5 million increase. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities decreased $51.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average sales margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $37.0 million decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $14.1 million decrease. Gross operating margin from our Permian Basin Gathering System increased $34.3 million year-to-year primarily due to a 456 BBtus/d increase in natural gas gathering volumes. 81 Table of Contents Petrochemical & Refined Products Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Petrochemical & Refined Products Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 Segment gross operating margin: Propylene production and related activities $ 471.0 $ 445.1 Butane isomerization and related operations 67.6 79.9 Octane enhancement and related plant operations 161.7 166.0 Refined products pipelines and related activities 318.6 330.8 Ethylene exports and other services 62.9 47.8 Total $ 1,081.8 $ 1,069.6 Selected volumetric data: Propylene production volumes (MBPD) 89 97 Butane isomerization volumes (MBPD) 96 109 Standalone DIB processing volumes (MBPD) 127 99 Octane enhancement and related plant sales volumes (MBPD) (1) 35 32 Pipeline transportation volumes, primarily refined products and petrochemicals (MBPD) 802 739 Marine terminal volumes, primarily refined products and petrochemicals (MBPD) 262 325 (1) Reflects aggregate sales volumes for our octane additive and iBDH facilities located at our Mont Belvieu complex and our HPIB facility located adjacent to the Houston Ship Channel. Propylene production and related activities Gross operating margin from propylene production and related activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $25.9 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross operating margin from our propylene production facilities increased a combined $14.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower operating costs, which accounted for an $18.9 million increase, and higher exchange and storage fee revenues, which accounted for an additional $15.6 million increase, partially offset by lower propylene and associated by-product sales volumes, which accounted for a $23.6 million decrease. Propylene production volumes at these facilities decreased a combined 6 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest). As refiners reduced their utilization rates in response to lower demand for refined products caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a decrease in the availability of refinery grade propylene feedstock used by our facilities to create polymer grade propylene. As a result, our propylene production volumes were reduced, with the largest impacts occurring in the second quarter of 2020. Gross operating margin from our propylene export terminals increased $10.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average terminal fees. Propylene export volumes decreased 3 MBPD year-to-year. Isomerization and related operations Gross operating margin from isomerization and related operations decreased a net $12.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average by-product sales prices, which accounted for a $21.9 million decrease, and lower isomerization volumes of 13 MBPD, which accounted for an additional $9.5 million decrease, partially offset by lower operating costs, which accounted for a $19.7 million increase. Octane enhancement and related plant operations Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement and related plant operations decreased a net $4.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average sales margins, which accounted for a $23.4 million decrease, and higher operating costs, which accounted for an additional $13.5 million decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $27.6 million increase. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to our iBDH plant, which is integrated with our legacy octane enhancement and high purity isobutylene assets and was placed into service in December 2019. 82 Table of Contents Refined products pipelines and related activities Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $12.2 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline System and associated terminals decreased a combined $37.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower interstate refined products transportation volumes, which accounted for a $12.5 million decrease, and lower NGL transportation volumes, which accounted for a $12.0 million decrease, higher operating costs, which accounted for a $3.8 million decrease, and lower average intrastate refined products transportation fees, which accounted for an additional $2.7 million decrease. Overall transportation volumes on our TE Products Pipeline System increased a net 34 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our refined products terminal in Beaumont, Texas decreased a net $7.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower storage revenues, which accounted for a $14.5 million decrease, partially offset by lower operating costs, which accounted for a $9.4 million increase. Marine terminal volumes at Beaumont decreased 53 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our refined products marketing activities increased $27.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes. Ethylene exports and other services Gross operating margin from ethylene exports and other services for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $15.1 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross operating margin from our ethylene export terminal and its related operations was a combined $25.6 million for 2020. Our ethylene export terminal and associated infrastructure were placed into limited service in December 2019 and full service in December 2020. Loading volumes at our ethylene export terminal for 2020 were 10 MBPD (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from marine transportation services decreased $12.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average fleet utilization rates in 2020. Liquidity and Capital Resources Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe that the Partnership and its consolidated businesses will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund their capital investments and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. At December 31, 2020, we had $6.06 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $5.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $1.06 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. We may issue debt and equity securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital investments. We have a universal shelf registration statement (the “2019 Shelf”) on file with the SEC which allows the Partnership and EPO to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. Enterprise Declares Cash Distribution for Fourth Quarter of 2020 On January 7, 2021, we announced that the Board declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.45 per common unit, or $1.80 per unit on an annualized basis, to be paid to the Partnership’s common unitholders with respect to the fourth quarter of 2020. The quarterly distribution was paid on February 11, 2021 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on January 29, 2021. The total amount paid was $988.8 million, which includes $7.1 million for distribution equivalent rights on phantom unit awards. In light of current economic conditions, management will evaluate any future increases in cash distributions on a quarterly basis. The payment of any quarterly cash distribution is subject to management’s evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in connection with such payments and Board approval. 83 Table of Contents Consolidated Debt At December 31, 2020, the average maturity of EPO’s consolidated debt obligations was approximately 20.4 years. The following table presents the scheduled maturities of principal amounts of EPO’s consolidated debt obligations at December 31, 2020 for the years indicated (dollars in millions): Total 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Principal amount of senior and junior debt obligations $ 30,146.4 $ 1,325.0 $ 1,400.0 $ 1,250.0 $ 850.0 $ 1,150.0 $ 24,171.4 In January 2020, EPO issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $1.0 billion principal amount of 2.80% fixed-rate senior notes due January 2030 (“Senior Notes AAA”), (ii) $1.0 billion principal amount of 3.70% fixed-rate senior notes due January 2051 (“Senior Notes BBB”) and (iii) $1.0 billion principal amount of 3.95% fixed-rate senior notes due January 2060 (“Senior Notes CCC”). Net proceeds from this offering were used by EPO for the repayment of $500 million principal amount of its Senior Notes Q that matured in January 2020, temporary repayment of amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program and for general company purposes. In addition, net proceeds from this offering were used by EPO for the repayment of $1.0 billion principal amount of its Senior Notes Y that matured in September 2020. In August 2020, EPO issued $1.0 billion principal amount of 3.20% fixed-rate senior notes due February 2052 (“Senior Notes DDD”) and $250.0 million principal amount of reopened 2.80% fixed-rate Senior Notes AAA. We received aggregate net proceeds of $1.25 billion from the sale of the notes after deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. Net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes were used for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments, and to repay a portion of the $750.0 million in principal amount of Senior Notes TT that matured in February 2021. In September 2020, EPO entered into a new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement that replaced its September 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement. The new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures in September 2021. There was no principal amount outstanding under the September 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement when it expired and was replaced by the September 2020 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement. In February 2021, EPO notified its trustee and paying agent to redeem all of the $575.0 million outstanding principal amount of its Senior Notes RR effective as of March 15, 2021 (one month prior to their scheduled maturity in April 2021). These notes are redeemable at EPO’s election at par (i.e., at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount of such notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon). On a short term basis, the redemption of EPO’s Senior Notes RR is expected to be made using proceeds from the issuance of short term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program. For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Credit Ratings As of March 1, 2021, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s, Baa1 from Moody’s and BBB+ from Fitch Ratings. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO’s short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor’s, P-2 from Moody’s and F-2 from Fitch Ratings. EPO’s credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. 84 Table of Contents Common Unit Repurchases Under 2019 Buyback Program In January 2019, we announced that the Board had approved a $2.0 billion multi-year unit buyback program (the “2019 Buyback Program”), which provides us with an additional method to return capital to investors. The 2019 Buyback Program authorizes the Partnership to repurchase its common units from time to time, including through open market purchases and negotiated transactions. The timing and pace of buy backs under the program will be determined by a number of factors including (i) our financial performance and flexibility, (ii) organic growth and acquisition opportunities with higher potential returns on investment, (iii) the market price of the Partnership’s common units and implied cash flow yield and (iv) maintaining targeted financial leverage, which is currently a debt-to-normalized adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio in the range of 3.25 to 3.75 times. No time limit has been set for completion of the 2019 Buyback Program, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We repurchased an aggregate 8,978,317 common units under the 2019 Buyback Program through open market and private purchases during the year ended December 31, 2020. The total purchase price of these repurchases was $186.3 million including commissions and fees. Units repurchased under the 2019 Buyback Program are immediately cancelled upon acquisition. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining available capacity under the 2019 Buyback Program was $1.73 billion. In addition to the 2019 Buyback Program, privately held affiliates of EPCO acquired 1,459,000 of our common units on the open market during the year ended December 31, 2020. In the aggregate, 10,437,317 common units were purchased on the open market during the year ended December 31, 2020 under the 2019 Buyback Program and by privately held affiliates of EPCO. Issuance of Common Units due to Settlement of Liquidity Option in March 2020 On March 5, 2020, we settled our obligations under the Liquidity Option Agreement by issuing 54,807,352 new common units to Skyline North Americas, Inc. in exchange for the capital stock of OTA. Upon settlement of the Liquidity Option, we indirectly acquired the 54,807,352 Partnership common units owned by OTA (which were issued by us to OTA in October 2014) and assumed all future income tax obligations of OTA, including its deferred tax liability. For additional information regarding settlement of the Liquidity Option, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. September 2020 Issuance of Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units On September 30, 2020, we issued and sold an aggregate of 50,000 Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units in a private placement transaction. The stated value of each preferred unit is $1,000 per unit. The total offering price for the preferred units was $50.0 million, of which $32.5 million was received in cash with the remaining $17.5 million funded through the exchange of 1,120,588 of our common units owned by the purchasers. Cash proceeds from the preferred unit offering include $15.0 million received from a privately held affiliate of EPCO for the purchase of 15,000 preferred units. Offering expenses were approximately $1.0 million. Concurrently, we exchanged all of the 54,807,352 Partnership common units owned directly by OTA for 855,915 of our new preferred units having an equivalent value. The preferred units held by OTA, like the common units OTA held prior to the exchange, are accounted for as treasury units by us in consolidation. The historical cost of the treasury units did not change as a result of the exchange and remains at the $1.3 billion recognized in March 2020 in connection with settlement of the Liquidity Option. For additional information regarding the preferred units, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 85 Table of Contents Cash Flow Statement Highlights The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 5,891.5 $ 6,520.5 Cash used in investing activities 3,120.7 4,575.5 Cash used in financing activities 2,022.7 1,945.1 Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. Changes in energy commodity prices may impact the demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemical and refined products, which could impact sales of our products and the demand for our midstream services. Changes in demand for our products and services may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, public health emergencies, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels. We may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their contractual obligations to us in connection with our marketing activities and long-term take-or-pay agreements. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts: Operating activities Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $629.0 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to: • a $310.1 million year-to-year decrease primarily due to higher levels of working capital employed in our marketing activities, which accounted for a $1.4 billion decrease, partially offset by the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations; • a $177.5 million year-to-year decrease resulting from lower partnership earnings in 2020 when compared to 2019 (determined by adjusting our $801.4 million year-to-year decrease in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); and • a $141.4 million year-to-year decrease in cash distributions attributable to earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, with those unconsolidated affiliates owning crude oil pipelines and terminals accounting for substantially all of the decrease. For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see “Income Statement Highlights” and “Business Segment Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $1.45 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to: • a $1.24 billion year-to-year decrease in investments for property, plant and equipment (see “Capital Investments” within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information); • a $124.2 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions attributable to the return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates, with those unconsolidated affiliates owning crude oil pipelines and terminals accounting for a majority of the increase; and 86 Table of Contents • a $96.0 million year-to-year decrease in investments in unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to lower cash outlays for NGL and crude oil pipeline projects. Financing activities Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased a net $77.6 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to: • a $601.9 million year-to-year decrease in cash contributions from noncontrolling interests. In July 2019, an affiliate of Apache Corporation acquired a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns the Shin Oak NGL Pipeline for $440.7 million. In addition, cash contributions from noncontrolling interests in connection with our Pascagoula natural gas processing plant and ethylene export facility decreased a combined $105.5 million year-to-year; • a $105.2 million year-to-year increase in cash used to acquire common units under our 2019 Buyback Program; • an $82.2 million year-to-year decrease in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units under our distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) and employee unit purchase plan (“EUPP”). In July 2019, the Partnership announced that, beginning with the quarterly distribution payment paid in August 2019, it would use common units purchased on the open market, rather than issuing new common units, to satisfy its delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP; and • a $51.2 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to common unitholders attributable to increases in the quarterly cash distribution rate per unit; partially offset by • a net $757.4 million year-to-year increase in net cash inflows from debt. In 2020, we issued $4.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, partially offset by the repayment of $1.5 billion principal amount of senior notes. In 2019, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, partially offset by the repayment or repurchase of $1.52 billion principal amount of senior and junior subordinated notes. In addition, net repayments of short term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program were $481.8 million in 2020 compared to net issuances of $481.8 million in 2019; and • a $31.5 million increase in net cash proceeds from the issuance of preferred units in September 2020. Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures Distributable Cash Flow Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business, including those for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash by the partnership allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets. We measure available cash by reference to distributable cash flow (“DCF”), which is a non-GAAP cash flow measure. DCF is an important financial measure for our common unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain our declared quarterly cash distributions. DCF is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships since the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Our management compares the DCF we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our common unitholders. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. Our calculation of DCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 87 Table of Contents Based on the level of available cash each quarter, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board of Enterprise GP, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Unlike several other master limited partnerships, our general partner has a non-economic ownership interest in us and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from us based on incentive distribution rights or other equity interests. Our use of DCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. For a discussion of net cash flows provided by operating activities, see “Cash Flow Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. The following table summarizes our calculation of DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 Net income attributable to common unitholders (GAAP) (1) $ 3,774.7 $ 4,591.3 Adjustments to net income attributable to common unitholders to derive DCF (addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 2,071.9 1,949.3 Cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates (2) 614.1 631.3 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates (426.1 ) (563.0 ) Asset impairment and related charges 890.6 132.8 Change in fair market value of derivative instruments (79.3 ) 27.2 Change in fair value of Liquidity Option 2.3 119.6 Deferred income tax expense (benefit) (147.6 ) 20.0 Sustaining capital expenditures (3) (293.6 ) (325.2 ) Other, net 20.2 20.0 Operational DCF (4) $ 6,427.2 $ 6,603.3 Proceeds from asset sales 12.8 20.6 Monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges (33.3 ) – DCF (non-GAAP) $ 6,406.7 $ 6,623.9 Cash distributions paid to common unitholders with respect to period, including distribution equivalent rights on phantom unit awards $ 3,926.9 $ 3,887.0 Cash distribution per common unit declared by Enterprise GP with respect to period (5) $ 1.7850 $ 1.7650 Total DCF retained by the Partnership with respect to period (6) $ 2,479.8 $ 2,736.9 Distribution coverage ratio (7) 1.63 x 1.70 x (1) For a discussion of the primary drivers of changes in our comparative income statement amounts, see “Income Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. (2) Reflects distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates attributable to earnings and the return of capital. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures include cash payments and accruals applicable to the period. (4) Represents DCF before proceeds from asset sales and the monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. (5) See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to the years indicated. (6) At the sole discretion of Enterprise GP, cash retained by the partnership with respect to each of these periods was primarily reinvested in growth capital projects. This retainage of cash substantially reduced our reliance on the equity capital markets to fund such expenditures. (7) Distribution coverage ratio is determined by dividing DCF by total cash distributions paid to common unitholders and in connection with distribution equivalent rights with respect to the period. 88 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by operating activities to DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 5,891.5 $ 6,520.5 Adjustments to reconcile net cash flows provided by operating activities to DCF (addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Net effect of changes in operating accounts 767.5 457.4 Sustaining capital expenditures (293.6 ) (325.2 ) Distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates attributable to the return of capital 187.5 63.3 Proceeds from asset sales 12.8 20.6 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (110.1 ) (95.8 ) Monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges (33.3 ) – Other, net (15.6 ) (16.9 ) DCF (non-GAAP) $ 6,406.7 $ 6,623.9 Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow (“FCF”), a non-GAAP financial measure, is a traditional cash flow metric that is widely used by a variety of investors and other participants in the financial community, as opposed to DCF, which is a cash flow measure primarily used by investors and others in evaluating midstream energy companies, including master limited partnerships. In general, FCF is a measure of how much cash flow a business generates during a specified time period after accounting for all capital investments, including expenditures for growth and sustaining capital projects. By comparison, only sustaining capital expenditures are reflected in DCF. We believe that FCF is important to traditional investors since it reflects the amount of cash available for reducing debt, investing in additional capital projects, paying distributions, common unit repurchases and similar matters. Since business partners fund certain capital projects of our consolidated subsidiaries, our determination of FCF reflects the amount of cash contributed from and distributed to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of FCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of FCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. FCF fluctuates based on our earnings, the level of investing activities we undertake each period, and the timing of operating cash receipts and payments. The following table summarizes our calculation of FCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 5,891.5 $ 6,520.5 Adjustments to net cash flows provided by operating activities to derive FCF (addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Cash used in investing activities (3,120.7 ) (4,575.5 ) Cash contributions from noncontrolling interests 30.9 632.8 Cash distributions paid to noncontrolling interests (131.3 ) (106.2 ) FCF (non-GAAP) $ 2,670.4 $ 2,471.6 The elements used in calculating FCF are sourced directly from our statements of consolidated cash flows presented under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For a discussion of significant year-to-year changes in our cash flow statement amounts, see “Cash Flow Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. 89 Table of Contents Capital Investments The following table summarizes our capital investments for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2020 2019 Capital investments for property, plant and equipment: (1) Growth capital projects (2) $ 2,985.8 $ 4,208.1 Sustaining capital projects (3) 302.1 323.6 Total $ 3,287.9 $ 4,531.7 Investments in unconsolidated affiliates $ 15.6 $ 111.6 (1) Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented on a cash basis. In total, these amounts represent “Capital expenditures” as presented on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. (2) Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. We placed a number of growth capital projects into commercial service during 2020 including: • Frac X and Frac XI in March 2020 and September 2020, respectively; • expansion projects on the Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline in April 2020; • the Midland-to-ECHO segment of the Midland-to-Webster pipeline in October 2020; and • refrigerated storage at our ethylene export terminal in December 2020. We currently have $3.6 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2023, which includes completion of a natural gasoline hydrotreater facility at our Mont Belvieu-area complex in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Gillis Lateral natural gas pipeline and related infrastructure in the fourth quarter of 2021, and our PDH 2 facility in the second quarter of 2023. Capital investing activity throughout the domestic energy industry has been significantly reduced in response to the supply and demand disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of these adverse macroeconomic conditions, we discussed with our customers and reevaluated our planned capital investments in order to modify the capacity, timing and need for certain capital projects and to maximize available liquidity. Based on information currently available, we expect our total capital investments for 2021, net of contributions from joint venture partners, to approximate $2.1 billion, which reflects growth capital investments of $1.6 billion and sustaining capital expenditures of $440 million. In addition, we currently expect our growth capital investments in 2022 and 2023 for sanctioned projects to approximate $800 million and $400 million, respectively. These amounts do not include capital investments associated with SPOT, our proposed deepwater offshore crude oil terminal, which remains subject to governmental approvals. We currently anticipate receiving approval for SPOT as early as the third quarter of 2021; however, we can give no assurance as to whether the project will ultimately be approved or the timing of such decision. Our forecast of capital investments for 2021 through 2023 is based on announced strategic operating and growth plans (through the filing date of this quarterly report), which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital investments due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather-related issues and changes in supplier prices. Furthermore, our forecast of capital investments may change due to decisions made by management at a later date, which may include unforeseen acquisition opportunities. Our success in raising capital, including partnering with other companies to share project costs and risks, continues to be a significant factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we expect to make the forecast capital investments noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions. 90 Table of Contents Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2020 with Year Ended December 31, 2019 In total, investments in growth capital projects decreased $1.2 billion year-to-year primarily due to the following: • completion of projects at our Mont Belvieu complex, which accounted for a $759.7 million decrease and included placing into service our iBDH facility (December 2019), Frac X (March 2020) and Frac XI (September 2020); • lower investments in natural gas processing facilities and related infrastructure that support Permian Basin production, which accounted for a $372.4 million decrease. We completed the final phase of our Orla plant in July 2019 and placed our Mentone plant into service in December 2019; • completion of the Shin Oak NGL Pipeline (in stages through the fourth quarter of 2019), which accounted for a $353.2 million decrease; and • lower investments in projects attributable to our ethylene business, which accounted for a $175.3 million decrease; partially offset by, • higher investments in our PDH 2 facility, which accounted for a $335.7 million increase; • higher investments in crude oil pipelines, including those expanding our Midland-to-ECHO System, and related infrastructure that support Permian Basin production, which accounted for a combined $82.2 million increase; and • higher investments in natural gas pipelines and related infrastructure in support of East Texas and Louisiana production, which accounted for a $47.9 million increase. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates decreased $96.0 million year-to-year primarily due to lower spending on NGL pipeline expansion projects, which accounted for a $49.4 million decrease, and lower spending on our joint venture dock infrastructure at Corpus Christi and other crude oil-related projects, which accounted for an additional $44.2 million decrease. Fluctuations in investments for sustaining capital projects are primarily due to the timing and cost of pipeline integrity and similar projects. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following sections discuss the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies: Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Depreciation expense incorporates management estimates regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets into service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected salvage values or (iv) significant changes in our forecast of the remaining life for the associated resource basins, if applicable. 91 Table of Contents At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $41.91 billion and $41.6 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.68 billion and $1.56 billion of depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets, which consist of intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable through future cash flows. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand for or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals or refined products. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated residual values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset’s estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include the usage of probabilities when there is a range of possible outcomes. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate there is a potential loss in value of the investment attributable to an other than temporary decline. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances include continuing operating losses of the entity and/or long-term negative changes in the entity’s industry. In the event we determine that the value of an investment is not recoverable due to an other than temporary decline, we record a non-cash impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful lives of the investment’s underlying assets. A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any write-down of the carrying values of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. In 2020 and 2019, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges attributable to assets other than goodwill totaling $594.3 million and $132.8 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For information regarding impairment charges involving property, plant and equipment and investments in unconsolidated affiliates, see Notes 4 and 5, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Valuation and Amortization Methods of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. The method used to value such assets depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns the asset is expected to generate. 92 Table of Contents Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to commercial relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. In certain instances, the acquisition of these intangible assets provides us with access to customers in a defined resource basin and is analogous to having a franchise in a particular area. Efficient operation of the acquired assets (e.g., a natural gas gathering system) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing producers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones within our existing asset footprint. The duration of this type of customer relationship is limited by the estimated economic life of the associated resource basin that supports the customer group. When estimating the economic life of a resource basin, we consider a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. In other situations, the acquisition of a customer relationship intangible asset provides us with access to customers whose hydrocarbon volumes are not attributable to specific resource basins. As with basin-specific customer relationships, efficient operation of the associated assets (e.g., a marine terminal that handles volumes originating from multiple sources) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing customers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones. The duration of this type of customer relationship is typically limited to the term of the underlying service contracts, including assumed renewals. The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the estimated economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization period for a basin-specific customer relationship asset is limited by the estimated finite economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basin. Contract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the contract is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a marine terminal, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements. If our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset’s carrying value is not recoverable through its future cash flows, we would be required to reduce the asset’s carrying value to its estimated fair value through the recording of a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was $3.31 billion and $3.45 billion, respectively. We recorded $143.2 million and $174.7 million of amortization expense attributable to intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets Our goodwill balance was $5.45 billion and $5.75 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Goodwill, which represents the cost of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of its net assets at the acquisition date, is subject to annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment charges represent the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value (including its respective goodwill) exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill. 93 Table of Contents We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using accepted valuation techniques, primarily through the use of discounted cash flows (i.e., an income approach to fair value) supplemented by market-based assessments, if available. The estimated fair values of our reporting units incorporate assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the assets and operations that comprise each reporting unit including: (i) discrete financial forecasts for the assets comprising the reporting unit, which, in turn, rely on management’s estimates of long-term operating margins, throughput volumes, capital investments and similar factors; (ii) long-term growth rates for the reporting unit’s cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. The fair value estimates are based on Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy. We believe that the assumptions we use in estimating reporting unit fair values are consistent with those that market participants would use in their fair value estimation process. However, due to uncertainties in the estimation process and volatility in the supply and demand for hydrocarbons and similar risk factors, actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. In December 2020, management determined that the carrying value of our natural gas pipelines and services reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. This reporting unit, which reflects the operations of our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services business segment, includes our natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines, storage facilities and related marketing activities. The long-term outlook for natural gas production in certain supply basins such as the Rocky Mountains and East Texas is expected to remain lower for longer due to reduced drilling activity. In addition, the decline in pipeline revenues attributable to lower regional natural gas price spreads is expected to adversely impact the future cash flows of our transmission pipelines. These factors, coupled with an increase in the estimated rate of return required for such businesses by market participants, resulted in the fair value of this reporting unit being less than its carrying value at December 31, 2020. The resulting goodwill impairment charge of $296.3 million represents the entire amount of goodwill attributable to this reporting unit. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2019. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment test at December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units, with the exception of our natural gas pipelines and services reporting unit, was at least 10% in excess of its carrying value. For information regarding our goodwill, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses As noted previously, preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect amounts presented in the financial statements. Due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions, we routinely employ estimates in connection with revenue and expense amounts in order to meet our accelerated financial reporting deadlines. Our most significant routine estimates involve revenues and costs of certain natural gas processing facilities, pipeline transportation revenues, fractionation revenues, marketing revenues and related purchases, and power and utility costs. These types of transactions must be estimated since the actual amounts are generally unavailable at the time we complete our accounting close process. The estimates subsequently reverse in the next accounting period when the corresponding actual customer billing or vendor-invoiced amounts are recorded. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates, which could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Prior to issuing our financial statements, we review our revenue and expense estimates based on currently available information to determine if adjustments are required. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. 94 Table of Contents Other Matters Parent-Subsidiary Guarantor Relationship The Partnership (the “Parent Guarantor”) has guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on the consolidated debt obligations of EPO (the “Subsidiary Issuer”), with the exception of the remaining debt obligations of TEPPCO Partners, L.P. (collectively, the “Guaranteed Debt”). If EPO were to default on any of its Guaranteed Debt, the Partnership would be responsible for full and unconditional repayment of such obligations. At December 31, 2020, the total amount of Guaranteed Debt was $30.59 billion, which was comprised of $27.5 billion of EPO’s senior notes, $2.63 billion of EPO’s junior subordinated notes and $455.6 million of related accrued interest. The Partnership’s guarantees of EPO’s senior note obligations, commercial paper notes and borrowings under bank credit facilities represent unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Partnership that rank equal in right of payment to all other existing or future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Partnership. In addition, these guarantees effectively rank junior in right of payment to any existing or future indebtedness of the Partnership that is secured and unsubordinated, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Partnership’s guarantees of EPO’s junior subordinated notes represent unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Partnership that rank equal in right of payment to all other existing or future subordinated indebtedness of the Partnership and senior in right of payment to all existing or future equity securities of the Partnership. The Partnership’s guarantees of EPO’s junior subordinated notes effectively rank junior in right of payment to (i) any existing or future indebtedness of the Partnership that is secured, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness and (ii) all other existing or future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Partnership. The Partnership may be released from its guarantee obligations only in connection with EPO’s exercise of its legal or covenant defeasance options as described in the underlying agreements. Selected Financial Information of Obligor Group The following tables present summarized financial information of the Partnership (as Parent Guarantor) and EPO (as Subsidiary Issuer) on a combined basis (collectively, the “Obligor Group”), after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions among the Obligor Group. In accordance with Rule 13.01 of Regulation S-X, the summarized financial information of the Obligor Group excludes the Obligor Group’s equity in income and investments in the consolidated subsidiaries of EPO that are not party to the guarantee obligations (the “Non-Obligor Subsidiaries”). The total carrying value of the Obligor Group’s investments in the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries was $45.98 billion at December 31, 2020. The Obligor Group’s equity in the earnings of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.54 billion. Although the net assets and earnings of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries are not directly available to the holders of the Guaranteed Debt to satisfy the repayment of such obligations, there are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries to pay distributions or make loans to EPO or the Partnership. EPO exercises control over the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries. We continue to believe that the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership presented under Item 8 of this annual report provide a more appropriate view of our credit standing. Our investment grade credit ratings are based on the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements and not the Obligor Group financial information presented below. 95 Table of Contents The following table presents summarized balance sheet information for the combined Obligor Group at December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions): Selected asset information: Current receivables from Non-Obligor Subsidiaries $ 775.4 Other current assets 5,805.7 Long-term receivables from Non-Obligor Subsidiaries 187.3 Other noncurrent assets, excluding investments in Non-Obligor Subsidiaries of $45.98 billion 8,198.5 Selected liability information: Current portion of Guaranteed Debt, including interest of $455.6 million $ 1,780.6 Current payables to Non-Obligor Subsidiaries 1,129.0 Other current liabilities 3,858.6 Noncurrent portion of Guaranteed Debt, principal only 28,806.8 Noncurrent payables to Non-Obligor Subsidiaries 27.0 Other noncurrent liabilities 42.9 Mezzanine equity of Obligor Group: Preferred units $ 49.3 The following table presents summarized income statement information for the combined Obligor Group for the year ended December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions): Revenues from Non-Obligor Subsidiaries $ 2,602.4 Revenues from other sources 15,361.4 Operating income of Obligor Group 1,069.7 Net loss of Obligor Group excluding equity in earnings of Non-Obligor Subsidiaries of $3.54 billion (157.0 ) Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions): Payment or Settlement due by Period In less than In 1-3 In 4-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1) $ 30,146.4 $ 1,325.0 $ 2,650.0 $ 2,000.0 $ 24,171.4 Estimated cash payments for interest (2) 28,834.6 1,294.0 2,442.2 2,284.2 22,814.2 Operating lease obligations (3) 460.5 33.7 69.3 58.7 298.8 Purchase obligations: Product purchase commitments (4) 14,800.7 2,266.6 4,230.6 3,501.4 4,802.1 Service payment commitments (4,5) 278.8 62.0 102.0 29.0 85.8 Other long-term liabilities (6) 365.8 – 85.8 50.8 229.2 Total contractual payment obligations $ 74,886.8 $ 4,981.3 $ 9,579.9 $ 7,924.1 $ 52,401.5 (1) Represents scheduled future maturities of our current and long-term debt principal obligations. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2020, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable interest rates. Our estimated cash payments for interest are influenced by the long-term maturities of our $2.65 billion in junior subordinated notes (due June 2067 through February 2078). The estimated cash payments assume that (i) the junior subordinated notes are not repaid prior to their respective maturity dates and (ii) the amount of interest paid on the junior subordinated notes is based on either (a) the current fixed interest rate charged or (b) the weighted-average variable rate paid in 2020, as applicable, for each note through the respective maturity date. (3) Primarily represents (i) land held pursuant to property leases, (ii) the lease of underground storage caverns for natural gas and NGLs, (iii) the lease of transportation equipment used in our operations and (iv) office space leased from affiliates of EPCO. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services as of December 31, 2020. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2020 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Primarily represents our unconditional payment obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts. (6) Primarily represents the noncurrent portion of asset retirement obligations and deferred revenues. 96 Table of Contents We are obligated to spend up to an aggregate $270 million over a ten-year period ending in 2025 on specified midstream gathering assets for certain producers utilizing our EFS Midstream System. If constructed, these new assets would be owned by us and be a component of the EFS Midstream System. As of December 31, 2020, we have spent $151 million of the $270 million commitment. Due to the uncertain timing of the remaining potential capital expenditures, we have excluded this amount from the preceding table. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Related Party Transactions For information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report as well as Part III, Item 13 of this annual report. Insurance For information regarding insurance matters, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. General In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding and the discount rates used to determine the present values. The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming: • the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk; • the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and • the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period. We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. Accordingly, the nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed. 97 Table of Contents See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. Commodity Hedging Activities The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps and basis swaps. The following table summarizes our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2020 (volume measures as noted): Volume (1) Accounting Derivative Purpose Current (2) Long-Term (2) Treatment Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas processing: Forecasted natural gas purchases for plant thermal reduction (billion cubic feet (“Bcf”)) 6.0 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs (million barrels (“MMBbls”)) (3) 0.6 n/a Cash flow hedge Natural gas marketing: Natural gas storage inventory management activities (Bcf) 4.0 n/a Fair value hedge NGL marketing: Forecasted purchases of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 142.8 1.6 Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 172.1 4.5 Cash flow hedge NGLs inventory management activities (MMBbls) 1.9 n/a Fair value hedge Refined products marketing: Forecasted purchases of refined products (MMBbls) 41.2 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of refined products (MMBbls) 51.1 3.3 Cash flow hedge Refined products inventory management activities (MMBbls) 0.8 n/a Fair value hedge Crude oil marketing: Forecasted purchases of crude oil (MMBbls) 32.9 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of crude oil (MMBbls) 44.5 n/a Cash flow hedge Petrochemical marketing: Forecasted purchases of petrochemical products (MMBbls) 0.4 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of petrochemical products (MMBbls) 0.5 n/a Cash flow hedge Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas risk management activities (Bcf) (3) 10.3 0.4 Mark-to-market NGL risk management activities (MMBbls) (3) 26.5 7.9 Mark-to-market Refined products risk management activities (MMBbls) (3) 6.9 n/a Mark-to-market Crude oil risk management activities (MMBbls) (3) 32.5 2.6 Mark-to-market (1) Volume for derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflects the total amount of volumes hedged whereas volume for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflects the absolute value of derivative notional volumes. (2) The maximum term for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is December 2022, December 2021 and October 2023, respectively. (3) Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with our transportation, processing and storage assets. At December 31, 2020, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory and (iii) hedging natural gas processing margins. 98 Table of Contents The following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair values of our principal commodity derivative instrument portfolios at the dates indicated (dollars in millions). The fair value information presented in the sensitivity analysis tables excludes the impact of applying Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) Rule 814, which deems that financial instruments cleared by the CME are settled daily in connection with variation margin payments. As a result of this exchange rule, CME-related derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and subject to future commodity price fluctuations until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms. Derivative transactions cleared on exchanges other than the CME (e.g., the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE) continue to be reported on a gross basis.

This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. Sensitivity Analysis At December 31, 2020, our interest rate hedging portfolio consisted of forward-starting swaps. Forward-starting swaps hedge the risk of an increase in underlying benchmark interest rates during the period of time between the inception date of the swap agreement and the future date of a debt issuance. Under the terms of the forward-starting swaps, we pay to the counterparties (at the expected settlement dates of the instruments) amounts based on a fixed interest rate applied to a notional amount and receive from the counterparties an amount equal to a variable interest rate (based on LIBOR or an equivalent index rate) on the same notional amount. With respect to the tabular data below, the portfolio’s estimated economic value at a given date is based on a number of factors, including the number and types of derivatives outstanding at that date, the notional value of the swaps and associated interest rates. The following table summarizes our portfolio of forward-starting swaps at December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions): Hedged Transaction Number and Typeof DerivativesOutstanding NotionalAmount ExpectedSettlementDate Weighted-AverageFixed RateLocked AccountingTreatment Future long-term debt offering 1 forward-starting swap $75.0 4/2021 2.41% Cash flow hedge Future long-term debt offering 5 forward-starting swaps $500.0 4/2021 2.13% Cash flow hedge Future long-term debt offering 2 forward-starting swaps (1) $150.0 2/2022 1.72% Cash flow hedge Future long-term debt offering 1 forward starting swap (1) $100.0 4/2021 1.46% Cash flow hedge Future long-term debt offering 2 forward starting swaps (1) $150.0 2/2022 1.48% Cash flow hedge Future long-term debt offering 2 forward starting swaps (1) $100.0 2/2022 0.95% Cash flow hedge (1) These swaps were entered into during the first quarter of 2020.

LIBOR phase-out The variable rates referenced in interest rate swap agreements often reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. announced a desire to phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of June 2023. Financial industry working groups are developing replacement rates and methodologies to transition existing agreements that depend on LIBOR as a reference rate. We currently do not expect the transition from LIBOR to have a material impact on us. 100 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:16:03.805199

Except as required by federal and state securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or any other reason. Overview of Business We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.” Our preferred units are not publicly traded. We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. We are owned by our limited partners (preferred and common unitholders) from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP, which owns a non-economic general partner interest in us, manages our Partnership. We conduct substantially all of our business operations through EPO and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our fully integrated, midstream energy asset network (or “value chain”) links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. Our midstream energy operations include: • natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; • NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and marine terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases, or “LPG,” and ethane); • crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and marine terminals; • propylene production facilities (including propane dehydrogenation (“PDH”) facilities), butane isomerization, octane enhancement, isobutane dehydrogenation (“iBDH”) and high purity isobutylene (“HPIB”) production facilities; • petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, and marine terminals (including those used to export ethylene and polymer grade propylene (“PGP”)); and • a marine transportation business that operates on key U.S. inland and intracoastal waterway systems. The safe operation of our assets is a top priority. We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of the public and those working on our behalf by conducting our business activities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. For additional information, see “Environmental, Safety and Conservation” within the Regulatory Matters section of Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report. 58 Table of Contents Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the “ASA”) or by other service providers. Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of segment gross operating margin for us. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to certain risks. For information regarding such risks, see “Risk Factors” included under Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. Current Outlook As noted previously, this annual report on Form 10-K, including this update to our outlook on business conditions, contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs and those of Enterprise GP. In addition, it reflects assumptions made by us and information currently available to us, which includes forecast information published by third parties. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information” within this Part II, Item 7 and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, for additional information. The following information presents our current views on key midstream energy supply and demand fundamentals. All references to U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) forecasts and expectations are derived from its February 2022 Short-Term Energy Outlook (“February 2022 STEO”), which was published on February 8, 2022. The level of services we provide and the amount of volumes we purchase and sell are directly affected by changes in supply and demand for hydrocarbon products, which impacts our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, supply and demand for hydrocarbon products were significantly reduced by the global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequences of containment measures including quarantines, travel restrictions, temporary business closures and similar protective actions. During late 2020 and early 2021, most countries began to gradually reduce mobility restrictions to less stringent methods of COVID-19 containment (e.g., vaccines, mask requirements and social distancing) allowing for the resumption of travel and business activities. These changes, coupled with strong fiscal and economic stimulus worldwide, helped bolster an economic recovery in most industrial economies. According to the EIA, U.S. gross domestic product increased 5.7% in 2021 compared to a decrease of 3.4% in 2020. This strong economic recovery has increased the demand for hydrocarbon products necessary to produce energy, transportation fuels and raw materials. Preliminary EIA estimates showed that the global consumption of petroleum and other liquid fuels grew by 5.2 MMBPD in 2021 while at the same time global liquid fuels inventories fell by an average of 1.6 MMBPD. Crude oil and other liquids production from a combination of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and non-OPEC members increased by only 1.7 MMBPD during this period. The growth in global crude oil consumption relative to production has led to a significant increase in crude oil prices as demonstrated by the average price of Brent crude oil, which increased from an average of $44 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2020 to $79 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2021. The EIA forecasts a reversal of this trend with a prediction that global crude oil and other liquids production will outpace consumption in 2022 and 2023, leading to a rise in global liquid fuels inventories. Their forecast shows global crude oil and other liquids consumption growing by a cumulative 5.4 MMBPD through 2023, while production is expected to grow by a cumulative 8.0 MMBPD through 2023. This is expected to cause a rise in global liquid fuels inventories by an average of 0.8 MMBPD in 2022 and 1.0 MMBPD in 2023, which is forecast to put downward pressure on crude oil prices. According to the EIA, Brent crude oil prices are forecasted to average $83 per barrel in 2022 before decreasing to $68 per barrel in 2023. 59 Table of Contents We acknowledge some uncertainties exist with respect to the forecasted increases in liquid fuels consumption levels due to the potential for continued supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, inflationary pressures and the potential for additional restrictions associated with COVID-19 containment measures should more contagious variants emerge. However, we are optimistic that these risks remain outweighed by the strength in the global economy, a seemingly widespread fatigue from COVID-19 related mobility and activity restrictions and the desire by the entire global population to improve their living conditions through the use of hydrocarbons for energy and materials. We believe that these additional production and consumption trends, along with the associated increases in inventory levels, will create additional opportunities to provide midstream services to our customers while leveraging the strengths of our portfolio, which include: • Our Assets – Our people find creative ways to optimize our large, integrated and diversified asset base to provide incremental services to customers and to respond to market opportunities. Additional production volumes could lead to higher demand for processing, transportation, fractionation and terminaling services. Storage services provide valuable flexibility for customers seeking to balance supply and demand while also allowing us to capture valuable contango and other marketing opportunities should they arise. • Our Customers – We have contracted with a large number of quality customers in order to achieve revenue diversification. In 2021, our top 200 largest customers represented 98.6% of consolidated revenues. Based on their respective year-end 2021 debt ratings, 87.0% of revenues from our top 200 customers were either investment grade rated or backed by letters of credit. Additionally, less than 3% of our top 200 customer revenues were attributable to sub-investment grade or non-rated upstream producers. • Our Liquidity – At December 31, 2021, we had $7.32 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $4.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $2.82 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. Our liquidity is supported by investment grade credit ratings on EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt of BBB+, Baa1 and BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively. • Our Access to Capital Markets – EPO successfully issued $1.0 billion in principal amount of senior notes in 2021. Based on current conditions, we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and/or access to debt capital markets to fund our operations, capital investments and the remaining principal amount of senior notes maturing through 2022. Recent Developments Enterprise Announces Acquisition of Navitas Midstream In January 2022, we announced that an affiliate of Enterprise entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC (“Navitas Midstream”) from an affiliate of Warburg Pincus LLC in a debt-free transaction for $3.25 billion in cash consideration. Navitas Midstream’s assets include approximately 1,750 miles of pipelines and over 1.0 Bcf/d of cryogenic natural gas processing capacity. The purchase price was paid in cash at closing on February 17, 2022. We funded the cash consideration for this acquisition using proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under our commercial paper program and cash on hand. 60 Table of Contents Enterprise Completes Expansion of Acadian Natural Gas Pipeline System in Louisiana In December 2021, we announced recently starting commercial service on our new Gillis Lateral pipeline and the associated expansion of our existing Acadian Haynesville Extension system to serve the growing liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) market on the Gulf Coast. The 83-mile Gillis Lateral pipeline originates near Alexandria, Louisiana on our Acadian Haynesville Extension system and extends to third party pipeline interconnects near Gillis, Louisiana, including multiple pipelines serving regional LNG export facilities. The recently completed Gillis Lateral pipeline has the capability to transport approximately 1.0 Bcf/d of natural gas. To accommodate the additional volumes, we increased capacity on our Acadian Haynesville Extension pipeline from 1.8 Bcf/d to 2.1 Bcf/d by adding horsepower at our Mansfield Compressor Station located in Mansfield, Louisiana. The Legacy Acadian and Haynesville Extension pipelines are part of the Acadian Gas System, which is comprised of approximately 1,300 miles of natural gas pipelines and leased underground storage. It links natural gas supplies in Louisiana and offshore Gulf of Mexico to distribution companies, electric utility plants and industrial customers located primarily in the Baton Rouge/New Orleans/Mississippi River corridor. Our 378-mile Haynesville Gathering System has a capacity of approximately 1.3 Bcf/d, can treat up to 810 MMcf/d of natural gas and provides a significant and reliable source of supply for the Acadian Gas System. Enterprise and Chevron Explore Carbon Storage Business Opportunities In September 2021, we and Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (“Chevron”) jointly announced a framework to study and evaluate opportunities for carbon dioxide capture, utilization and storage from our respective business operations in the U.S. Midcontinent and Gulf Coast. Projects resulting from this evaluation would seek to combine our extensive midstream pipeline and storage network with Chevron’s sub-surface expertise to create opportunities to capture, aggregate, transport and sequester carbon dioxide in support of the evolving energy landscape. The initial phase of the study in which we will evaluate specific business opportunities is expected to last about six months. Issuance of $1.0 Billion of Senior Notes in September 2021 In September 2021, EPO issued $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due February 2053 (“Senior Notes EEE”). Net proceeds from this offering were used for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments, and the repayment of debt (including the repayment of a portion of our $750.0 million in principal amount of 3.50% Senior Notes VV and a portion of our $650.0 million in principal amount of 4.05% Senior Notes CC, in each case at their maturity in February 2022). Senior Notes EEE were issued at 99.170% of their principal amount and have a fixed rate of interest of 3.30% per year. The Partnership guaranteed these senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis. Enterprise and Magellan Team Up With Intercontinental Exchange for New Houston Crude Oil Futures Contract In June 2021, we, Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P (“Magellan”) and Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”) announced the establishment of a new futures contract for the physical delivery of crude oil in the Houston, Texas area in response to market interest for a Houston-based index with greater scale, flow assurance and price transparency. On January 24, 2022, the ICE Midland WTI American Gulf Coast futures contract went live for trading with the March 2022 contract being the first contract month for deliveries. The quality specifications of the new futures contract are consistent with West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) originating from the Permian Basin with common delivery options at either our ECHO terminal in Houston or Magellan’s East Houston terminal. In support of this new futures contract, we and Magellan have discontinued provisions for delivery services under legacy futures contracts that are deliverable at each terminal. 61 Table of Contents Selected Energy Commodity Price Data The following table presents selected average index prices for natural gas and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods indicated: Polymer Refinery Indicative Gas Natural Normal Natural Grade Grade Processing Gas, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Gasoline, Propylene, Propylene, Gross Spread $/MMBtu $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/pound $/pound $/gallon (1) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (3) (3) (4) 2020 by quarter: 1st Quarter $1.95 $0.14 $0.37 $0.57 $0.63 $0.93 $0.31 $0.18 $0.19 2nd Quarter $1.71 $0.19 $0.41 $0.43 $0.44 $0.41 $0.26 $0.11 $0.17 3rd Quarter $1.98 $0.22 $0.50 $0.58 $0.60 $0.80 $0.35 $0.17 $0.25 4th Quarter $2.67 $0.21 $0.57 $0.76 $0.68 $0.92 $0.41 $0.24 $0.22 2020 Averages $2.08 $0.19 $0.46 $0.59 $0.59 $0.77 $0.33 $0.18 $0.21 2021 by quarter: 1st Quarter $2.71 $0.24 $0.89 $0.94 $0.93 $1.33 $0.73 $0.44 $0.38 2nd Quarter $2.83 $0.26 $0.87 $0.97 $0.98 $1.46 $0.67 $0.27 $0.41 3rd Quarter $4.02 $0.35 $1.16 $1.34 $1.34 $1.62 $0.82 $0.36 $0.51 4th Quarter $5.84 $0.39 $1.24 $1.46 $1.46 $1.82 $0.66 $0.33 $0.41 2021 Averages $3.85 $0.31 $1.04 $1.18 $1.18 $1.56 $0.72 $0.35 $0.43 (1) Natural gas prices are based on Henry-Hub Inside FERC commercial index prices as reported by Platts, which is a division of S&P Global, Inc. (2) NGL prices for ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane and natural gasoline are based on Mont Belvieu, Texas Non-TET commercial index prices as reported by Oil Price Information Service by IHS Markit (“IHS”). (3) Polymer grade propylene prices represent average contract pricing for such product as reported by IHS. Refinery grade propylene (“RGP”) prices represent weighted-average spot prices for such product as reported by IHS. (4) The “Indicative Gas Processing Gross Spread” represents our generic estimate of the gross economic benefit from extracting NGLs from natural gas production based on certain pricing assumptions. Specifically, it is the amount by which the assumed economic value of a composite gallon of NGLs in Chambers County, Texas exceeds the value of the equivalent amount of energy in natural gas at Henry Hub, Louisiana. Our estimate of the indicative spread does not consider the operating costs incurred by a natural gas processing facility to extract the NGLs nor the transportation and fractionation costs to deliver the NGLs to market. In addition, the actual gas processing spread earned at each plant is further influenced by regional pricing and extraction dynamics. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.75 per gallon in 2021 versus $0.38 per gallon for 2020. 62 Table of Contents The following table presents selected average index prices for crude oil for the periods indicated: WTI Midland Houston LLS Crude Oil, Crude Oil, Crude Oil Crude Oil, $/barrel $/barrel $/barrel $/barrel (1) (2) (2) (3) 2020 by quarter: 1st Quarter $46.17 $45.51 $47.81 $48.15 2nd Quarter $27.85 $28.22 $29.68 $30.12 3rd Quarter $40.93 $41.05 $41.77 $42.47 4th Quarter $42.66 $43.07 $43.63 $44.08 2020 Averages $39.40 $39.46 $40.72 $41.21 2021 by quarter: 1st Quarter $57.84 $59.00 $59.51 $59.99 2nd Quarter $66.07 $66.41 $66.90 $67.95 3rd Quarter $70.56 $70.74 $71.17 $71.51 4th Quarter $77.19 $77.82 $78.27 $78.41 2021 Averages $67.92 $68.49 $68.96 $69.47 (1) WTI prices are based on commercial index prices at Cushing, Oklahoma as measured by the NYMEX.

(3) Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) prices are based on commercial index prices as reported by Platts. Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices. An increase in our consolidated marketing revenues due to higher energy commodity sales prices may not result in an increase in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also be expected to increase due to comparable increases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same type of relationship would be true in the case of lower energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs. We attempt to mitigate commodity price exposure through our hedging activities and the use of fee-based arrangements. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” under Part II, Item 7A of this annual report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities. 63 Table of Contents Income Statement Highlights The following table summarizes the key components of our consolidated results of operations for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Revenues $ 40,806.9 $ 27,199.7 Costs and expenses: Operating costs and expenses: Cost of sales 29,887.0 16,723.2 Other operating costs and expenses 2,914.1 2,800.2 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 2,037.5 1,961.5 Asset impairment charges 232.6 890.6 Net gains attributable to asset sales and related matters 6.1 (4.4 ) Total operating costs and expenses 35,077.3 22,371.1 General and administrative costs 209.3 219.6 Total costs and expenses 35,286.6 22,590.7 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 583.4 426.1 Operating income 6,103.7 5,035.1 Other income (expense): Interest expense (1,283.0 ) (1,287.4 ) Other, net 4.6 13.7 Total other expense, net (1,278.4 ) (1,273.7 ) Income before income taxes 4,825.3 3,761.4 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (70.0 ) 124.3 Net income 4,755.3 3,885.7 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (117.6 ) (110.1 ) Net income attributable to preferred units (3.6 ) (0.9 ) Net income attributable to common unitholders $ 4,634.1 $ 3,774.7 Revenues The following table presents each business segment’s contribution to consolidated revenues for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 NGL Pipelines & Services: Sales of NGLs and related products $ 13,716.5 $ 8,970.7 Midstream services 2,586.1 2,206.5 Total 16,302.6 11,177.2 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services: Sales of crude oil 9,519.0 5,410.8 Midstream services 1,383.2 1,278.2 Total 10,902.2 6,689.0 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services: Sales of natural gas 3,412.7 1,530.5 Midstream services 986.9 1,022.6 Total 4,399.6 2,553.1 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services: Sales of petrochemicals and refined products 8,195.7 5,942.6 Midstream services 1,006.8 837.8 Total 9,202.5 6,780.4 Total consolidated revenues $ 40,806.9 $ 27,199.7 64 Table of Contents Total revenues for 2021 increased $13.61 billion when compared to 2020 primarily due to a $12.99 billion increase in marketing revenues. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs, natural gas, petrochemicals and refined products increased a combined net $8.88 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales prices, which accounted for an $11.4 billion increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $2.52 billion decrease. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil increased $4.11 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales prices, which accounted for a $2.84 billion increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $1.27 billion increase. Revenues from midstream services for 2021 increased $617.9 million when compared to 2020. Revenues from our natural gas processing facilities increased $263.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average market values for the equity NGLs we receive as non-cash consideration for processing services. Revenues from our terminal facilities increased $190.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher deficiency fee revenue. Revenues from our crude oil pipeline assets increased $124.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher demand for crude oil transportation services. Lastly, revenues from our propylene production facilities increased $74.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher propylene fractionation fees. For additional information regarding our revenues, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.

The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs, natural gas, petrochemicals and refined products increased a combined net $8.55 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher average purchase prices, which accounted for a $10.65 billion increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $2.1 billion decrease. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil increased $4.61 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher average purchase prices, which accounted for a $3.45 billion increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $1.16 billion increase. Other operating costs and expenses Other operating costs and expenses for 2021 increased $113.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher maintenance and employee compensation costs and ad valorem taxes. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $76.0 million year-to-year primarily due to assets placed into full or limited service since the first quarter of 2020 (e.g., Chambers County Frac X and XI, and the Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline) and major maintenance activities accounted for under the deferral method. We adopted the deferral method for our reaction-based plants in November 2020. Under the deferral method, major maintenance costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next major overhaul project. Asset impairment chargesNon-cash asset impairment charges decreased $658.0 million year-to-year primarily due to the recognition in 2020 of the full impairment of goodwill associated with our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services business segment, which accounted for $296.3 million of expense, the partial impairment of our marine transportation business, which accounted for $256.7 million of expense, and the partial impairment of natural gas gathering and processing assets in South Texas, which accounted for an additional $125.7 million of expense. For information regarding these charges, see Notes 2, 4 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. General and administrative costs General and administrative costs for 2021 decreased $10.3 million when compared to 2020 primarily due to lower professional services costs. Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2021 increased $157.3 million when compared to 2020 primarily due to higher earnings from investments in crude oil pipelines. 65 Table of Contents Operating income Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $1.07 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Interest expense The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 1,298.9 $ 1,330.6 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization 38.3 39.3 Interest costs capitalized in connection with construction projects (1) (79.6 ) (115.0 ) Other (2) 25.4 32.5 Total $ 1,283.0 $ 1,287.4 (1) We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital investment levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. (2) Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is a key driver of interest expense, decreased $31.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower debt principal amounts outstanding during 2021, which accounted for a $25.3 million decrease, and the effects of lower overall interest rates during 2021, which accounted for an additional $6.4 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2021 was $29.48 billion compared to $29.91 billion for 2020. For information regarding our debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Income taxes The following table presents the components of our consolidated benefit from (provision for) income taxes for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Deferred tax benefit (expense) attributable to OTA $ (27.6 ) $ 155.3 Revised Texas Franchise Tax (“Texas Margin Tax”) (41.9 ) (32.1 ) Other (0.5 ) 1.1 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $ (70.0 ) $ 124.3 On February 25, 2020, we received notice from Marquard & Bahls AG (“M&B”) of its election to exercise its rights under the Liquidity Option Agreement among the Partnership, OTA Holdings, Inc. (a Delaware corporation previously named Oiltanking Holding Americas, Inc. (“OTA”)), and M&B dated October 1, 2014 (the “Liquidity Option Agreement”). The Partnership settled its obligations under the Liquidity Option Agreement on March 5, 2020 and indirectly assumed the deferred tax liability of OTA, which reflects OTA’s outside basis difference in the limited partner interests it received from the Partnership in October 2014. 66 Table of Contents At March 5, 2020, the Partnership’s liability recognized in connection with the Liquidity Option Agreement was $511.9 million (referred to as the “Liquidity Option liability”). Upon settlement of the Liquidity Option Agreement, the Liquidity Option liability was effectively replaced by the deferred tax liability of OTA calculated in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Since the book value of the Liquidity Option liability exceeded OTA’s estimated deferred tax liability of $439.7 million on that date, we recognized a non-cash benefit in earnings of $72.2 million, which is reflected in the “Benefit from (provision for) income taxes” line on our Statement of Consolidated Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. OTA recognized an additional net, non-cash deferred income tax benefit of $83.1 million which reflected a decrease in the outside basis difference of its investment in the Partnership caused by a decline in the market price of the Partnership’s common units subsequent to March 5, 2020 through September 30, 2020. In total, our earnings for 2020 reflect $155.3 million of deferred income tax benefit attributable to OTA. On September 30, 2020, OTA exchanged the Partnership common units it owned for non-publicly traded preferred units having a stated value of $1,000 per unit. As a result and beginning September 30, 2020, OTA’s deferred tax liability no longer fluctuates due to market price changes in our common units. Income tax expense attributable to the Texas Margin Tax increased $9.8 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in the Texas apportionment factor and higher Partnership earnings. For information regarding our income taxes, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Business Segment Highlights Our operations are reported under four business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services and (iv) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. The following information summarizes the assets and operations of each business segment: • Our NGL Pipelines & Services business segment includes our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities, NGL pipelines, NGL fractionation facilities, NGL and related product storage facilities, and NGL marine terminals. • Our Crude Oil Pipelines & Services business segment includes our crude oil pipelines, crude oil storage and marine terminals, and related crude oil marketing activities. • Our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services business segment includes our natural gas pipeline systems that provide for the gathering, treating and transportation of natural gas. This segment also includes our natural gas marketing activities. • Our Petrochemical & Refined Products Services business segment includes our (i) propylene production facilities, which include propylene fractionation units and a PDH facility, and related pipelines and marketing activities, (ii) butane isomerization complex and related deisobutanizer (“DIB”) operations, (iii) octane enhancement, iBDH and HPIB production facilities, (iv) refined products pipelines, terminals and related marketing activities, (v) an ethylene export terminal and related operations; and (vi) marine transportation business. We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. 67 Table of Contents The following table presents gross operating margin by segment and total gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measure, for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Gross operating margin by segment: NGL Pipelines & Services $ 4,315.9 $ 4,182.4 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services 1,679.9 1,997.3 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 1,155.5 926.6 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services 1,357.2 1,081.8 Total segment gross operating margin (1) 8,508.5 8,188.1 Net adjustment for shipper make-up rights 53.8 (85.7 ) Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 8,562.3 $ 8,102.4 (1) Within the context of this table, total segment gross operating margin represents a subtotal and corresponds to measures similarly titled within our business segment disclosures found under Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Total gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Total gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of gross operating margin may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment gross operating margin for NGL Pipelines & Services and Crude Oil Pipelines & Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights that are included in management’s evaluation of segment results. However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total gross operating margin. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income. For a discussion of operating income and its components, see the previous section titled “Income Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income to total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Operating income $ 6,103.7 $ 5,035.1 Adjustments to reconcile operating income to total gross operating margin(addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses (1) 2,010.6 1,961.5 Asset impairment charges in operating costs and expenses 232.6 890.6 Net losses (gains) attributable to asset sales and related matters in operatingcosts and expenses 6.1 (4.4 ) General and administrative costs 209.3 219.6 Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 8,562.3 $ 8,102.4 (1) Excludes amortization of major maintenance costs for reaction-based plants, which are a component of gross operating margin. Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin for us. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. 68 Table of Contents Winter Storms Uri and Viola in 2021 Two major winter storms, Uri and Viola, impacted Texas and the southern U.S. in mid-February 2021 (the “February 2021 winter storms”). The storms had a major impact on the electric power grid in Texas, which resulted in widespread power outages. Voluntarily and in accordance with our agreements with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (“ERCOT”), we temporarily shut down our non-essential plants and other operations in Texas to support residential power consumption. Those Texas assets that remained operational (e.g., our natural gas processing plants, storage facilities and Texas Intrastate System) were impacted by rolling blackouts. The economic impacts of these disruptions, higher power and natural gas costs, as well as losses on natural gas hedges, were mitigated by sales of natural gas to electricity generators, natural gas utilities and industrial customers to assist them in meeting their requirements. During and following the storms, many of our customers also experienced downtime due to freeze-related damage and repairs that impacted our volumes. Estimated Impact of Hurricane Ida on Results for 2021 In late August 2021, southern Louisiana and Mississippi, including its critical energy infrastructure, were impacted by the cumulative effects of Hurricane Ida. Impacts on the energy industry included, but were not limited to, severe flooding and limited access to facilities, disruptions to offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico, and reduced energy demand from area refineries and petrochemical facilities. Our plant, pipeline and storage assets in southern Louisiana and Mississippi did not experience significant property damage, and the majority have returned to normal operations. We expect our volumes impacted by the remaining third-party facility disruptions to return to normal levels as repairs are completed and production is fully restored. We estimate that Hurricane Ida reduced our gross operating margin for the third and fourth quarters of 2021 by approximately $34 million, almost all of which is related to our Louisiana and Mississippi processing, transportation and fractionation assets and related marketing activities, which are a component of our NGL Pipelines & Services segment. Of this amount, approximately $29 million represents the combined net impact of lower than anticipated volumes and lost business opportunities. The remaining $5 million represents expenses, net of property damage insurance reimbursements, which we incurred during the year in connection with hurricane-related repair and recovery costs. NGL Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Segment gross operating margin: Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities $ 1,134.8 $ 997.5 NGL pipelines, storage and terminals 2,323.7 2,524.1 NGL fractionation 857.4 660.8 Total $ 4,315.9 $ 4,182.4 Selected volumetric data: NGL pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 3,412 3,589 NGL marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 658 722 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 1,253 1,359 Equity NGL production volumes (MBPD) (1) 167 151 Fee-based natural gas processing volumes (MMcf/d) (2, 3) 4,057 4,285 (1) Represents the NGL volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities. (2) Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our natural gas processing plants. (3) Fee-based natural gas processing volumes are measured at either the wellhead or plant inlet in MMcf/d. 69 Table of Contents Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $137.3 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross operating margin from our Permian Basin natural gas processing facilities increased $93.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $67.9 million increase, and higher processing volumes, which accounted for an additional $28.9 million increase. On a combined basis, fee-based natural gas processing and equity NGL production volumes at our Permian Basin plants increased 158 MMcf/d and 27 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing facilities located in the Rocky Mountains (Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco plants) increased a combined $73.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities). On a combined basis, fee-based natural gas processing and equity NGL production volumes at these plants decreased 245 MMcf/d and 3 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas processing facilities increased $44.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities). Net to our interest, combined fee-based natural gas processing and equity NGL production volumes at these plants decreased 50 MMcf/d and increased 3 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities decreased $72.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average sales margins, which accounted for a $44.4 million decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $18.0 million decrease. The year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin can be attributed to results from marketing strategies that seek to optimize our export, storage and plant assets, which accounted for a combined $154.6 million decrease, partially offset by higher earnings from strategies that seek to optimize our transportation assets, which accounted for a $91.3 million increase. In addition, gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities attributable to non-cash, mark-to-market earnings decreased $9.6 million year-to-year. NGL pipelines, storage and terminals Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines, storage and terminal assets for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $200.4 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. A number of our pipelines, including the Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole NGL Pipeline, Chaparral NGL Pipeline, and Shin Oak NGL Pipeline, serve Permian Basin and/or Rocky Mountain producers. On a combined basis, gross operating margin from these pipelines decreased $109.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower transportation volumes of 49 MBPD (net to our interest), which accounted for an $57.3 million decrease, and a $44.0 million decrease due to lower average transportation and deficiency fees, which was primarily due to certain contracts associated with the Rocky Mountain segment of our Mid-America Pipeline System reaching their termination date in September 2021. Gross operating margin from LPG-related activities at our Enterprise Hydrocarbons Terminal (“EHT”) decreased $53.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower export volumes of 87 MBPD. Gross operating margin from our related Houston Ship Channel Pipeline decreased $11.9 million year-to-year primarily due to an 81 MBPD decrease in transportation volumes. Gross operating margin at our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal increased $12.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher export volumes of 23 MBPD. Gross operating margin from our Dixie Pipeline and related terminals decreased a combined $23.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher maintenance and other operating costs, which accounted for a $12.0 million decrease, and lower transportation volumes of 20 MBPD, which accounted for an additional $10.9 million decrease. Gross operating margin from our Chambers County storage complex decreased a net $14.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating costs, which accounted for a $16.8 million decrease, and lower throughput fee revenues, which accounted for an additional $10.7 million decrease, partially offset by higher storage fee revenues, which accounted for a $13.0 million increase. Gross operating margin from our ATEX Pipeline decreased $10.6 million year-to-year primarily due to a 3 MBPD decrease in transportation volumes, which accounted for a $5.3 million decrease, and higher operating costs, which accounted for an additional $3.4 million decrease. 70 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System increased $13.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher pipeline capacity fee revenues. Transportation volumes on our South Texas NGL Pipeline System decreased 7 MBPD year-to-year. NGL fractionation Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation during the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $196.6 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross operating margin from our Chambers County NGL fractionation complex increased a net $196.3 million year-to-year. This increase was primarily due to higher fractionation volumes, which accounted for a $151.1 million increase, and higher ancillary service revenues, which accounted for an additional $59.4 million increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for a $136.8 million decrease. NGL fractionation volumes at our Chambers County NGL fractionation complex, which includes the average daily operating rates for newly constructed assets from the time the asset was placed into service, decreased 55 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest). While the average daily operating rate for our Chambers County NGL fractionation complex decreased year-to-year, total NGL fractionation volumes increased primarily due to a full period of contributions from Frac X and Frac XI, which entered service in late March 2020 and September 2020, respectively. In addition, gross operating margin at our Chambers County NGL fractionation complex increased due to $63.2 million in margins on the optimization of our power supply arrangements and $40.5 million of payments received in connection with our participation in the Texas Load Resources Demand Response Program (“LaaR”) during the February 2021 winter storms. The amounts earned from optimization activities were based on the settlement of ERCOT prices, which were finalized by the State of Texas during the second quarter of 2021. The amounts earned from the LaaR program partially compensate us for higher electricity expenses incurred during the storms and for lost revenues resulting from voluntary fractionation plant outages during the storms. The natural gasoline hydrotreater at our Chambers County complex, which was placed into service in October 2021, generated gross operating margin of $6.8 million. Gross operating margin from our Norco NGL fractionator decreased $13.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher maintenance costs and lower fractionation volumes as a result of downtime for major maintenance activities during the second quarter of 2021 and Hurricane Ida during the third quarter of 2021. NGL fractionation volumes at our Norco NGL fractionator decreased 16 MBPD year-to-year. Crude Oil Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Segment gross operating margin: Midland-to-ECHO System and related business activities $ 381.4 $ 359.2 Other crude oil pipelines, terminals and related marketing results 1,298.5 1,638.1 Total $ 1,679.9 $ 1,997.3 Selected volumetric data: Crude oil pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 2,088 2,166 Crude oil marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 645 724 Gross operating margin from our Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $317.4 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing activities (excluding those attributable to the Midland-to-ECHO System) decreased $264.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average sales margins, which accounted for a $231.8 million decrease, and lower non-cash, mark-to-market earnings, which accounted for an additional decrease of $22.9 million. Results from crude oil marketing strategies that optimize our storage and transportation assets decreased $177.5 million and $45.0 million, respectively, year-to-year. 71 Table of Contents Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System decreased $42.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower transportation volumes of 17 MBPD, which accounted for a $26.5 million decrease, and lower average transportation fees, which accounted for an additional $20.6 million decrease. Gross operating margin from our equity investment in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline decreased $12.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower transportation volumes of 42 MBPD (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our West Texas Pipeline System decreased $39.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average transportation fees. Transportation volumes on our West Texas Pipeline System increased 34 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from crude oil activities at EHT decreased $20.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower storage revenues and other fees. Crude oil terminal volumes at EHT decreased 112 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our equity investment in the Seaway Pipeline increased $35.5 million year-to-year primarily due to LaaR payments from power service providers in connection with the February 2021 winter storms. Transportation volumes on our Seaway Pipeline decreased 30 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our Midland-to-ECHO System and related business activities increased a net $22.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes, which accounted for a $95.6 million increase, partially offset by lower average sales margins from marketing activities, which accounted for a $77.5 million decrease. Natural Gas Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Segment gross operating margin $ 1,155.5 $ 926.6 Selected volumetric data: Natural gas pipeline transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 14,249 13,421 Gross operating margin from our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $228.9 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. As noted previously, two major winter storms impacted Texas and the southern U.S. in mid-February 2021. Given the higher demand for natural gas during the February 2021 winter storms, we sold natural gas to assist electricity generators, natural gas utilities and industrial customers in meeting their requirements. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities increased $267.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins in connection with these unusual storm events. Gross operating margin from our Permian Basin Gathering System increased $15.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher condensate sales, which accounted for a $10.8 million increase, and higher natural gas gathering volumes of 200 BBtus/d, which accounted for an additional $8.5 million increase. The year-to-year increase in gathering volumes is attributable to deliveries at our Orla facility. Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System decreased a net $58.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower capacity reservation revenues, which accounted for a $118.2 million decrease, partially offset by higher storage and other fees, which accounted for a $32.8 million increase, and higher transportation volumes of 591 BBtus/d, which accounted for an additional $18.6 million increase. 72 Table of Contents Petrochemical & Refined Products Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Petrochemical & Refined Products Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Segment gross operating margin: Propylene production and related activities $ 798.2 $ 471.0 Butane isomerization and related operations 75.0 67.6 Octane enhancement and related plant operations 106.9 161.7 Refined products pipelines and related activities 289.6 318.6 Ethylene exports and related activities 73.8 25.6 Marine transportation and other services 13.7 37.3 Total $ 1,357.2 $ 1,081.8 Selected volumetric data: Propylene production volumes (MBPD) 99 89 Butane isomerization volumes (MBPD) 85 96 Standalone DIB processing volumes (MBPD) 154 127 Octane enhancement and related plant sales volumes (MBPD) (1) 33 35 Pipeline transportation volumes, primarily refined products and petrochemicals (MBPD) 890 802 Marine terminal volumes, primarily refined products and petrochemicals (MBPD) 234 262 (1) Reflects aggregate sales volumes for our octane additive and iBDH facilities located at our Chambers County complex and our HPIB facility located adjacent to the Houston Ship Channel. Propylene production and related activities Gross operating margin from propylene production and related activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $327.2 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross operating margin from our Chambers County propylene production facilities increased a combined net $324.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for a $220.5 million increase, higher propylene fractionation fees, which accounted for a $119.6 million increase, and higher propylene sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $31.6 million increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for a $52.6 million decrease. Propylene and associated by-product production volumes at these facilities increased a combined 9 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest). Butane isomerization and related operations Gross operating margin from isomerization and related operations increased a net $7.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average by-product sales prices, which accounted for a $22.1 million increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for a $14.7 million decrease. Octane enhancement and related plant operations Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement and related plant operations decreased $54.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating costs, which accounted for a $29.4 million decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $25.9 million decrease. Volumes at these facilities for 2021 were lower when compared to 2020 primarily due to planned major maintenance activities, which were completed in the last week of January 2021 for our HPIB plant and the beginning of May 2021 for our octane enhancement plant. Refined products pipelines and related activities Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $29.0 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross operating margin from our refined products marketing activities decreased $44.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average sales margins. Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline System and associated terminals increased a combined $13.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher aggregate transportation volumes. Overall transportation volumes on our TE Products Pipeline System increased a net 56 MBPD year-to-year. 73 Table of Contents Ethylene exports and related activities Gross operating margin from ethylene exports and related activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $48.2 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross operating margin from our ethylene export terminal increased $23.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher export volumes of 4 MBPD (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our other ethylene activities increased $24.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher storage fees, which accounted for an $11.5 million increase, higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $4.7 million increase, and higher average sales margins, which accounted for an additional $4.6 million increase. Marine transportation and other services Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other services decreased $23.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average fees and lower average fleet utilization rates in 2021. Liquidity and Capital Resources Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe that the Partnership and its consolidated businesses will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund their capital investments and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. At December 31, 2021, we had $7.32 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $4.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $2.82 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. We may issue debt and equity securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital investments. We have a universal shelf registration statement (the “2021 Shelf”) on file with the SEC which allows the Partnership and EPO to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. The 2021 Shelf replaced our prior universal shelf registration statement, which is set to expire in March 2022. Cash Flow Statement Highlights The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 8,512.5 $ 5,891.5 Cash used in investing activities 2,134.6 3,120.7 Cash used in financing activities 4,571.3 2,022.7 Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. Changes in energy commodity prices may impact the demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemical and refined products, which could impact sales of our products and the demand for our midstream services. Changes in demand for our products and services may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, public health emergencies, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels. We may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their contractual obligations to us in connection with our marketing activities and long-term take-or-pay agreements. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 74 Table of Contents The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts: Operating activities Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $2.62 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to: • a $1.57 billion year-to-year increase attributable to the return of working capital employed in our marketing activities primarily related to storage optimization strategies; • a $568.7 million year-to-year increase primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations; • a $369.6 million year-to-year increase resulting from higher partnership earnings in 2021 when compared to 2020 (determined by adjusting our $869.6 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); and • a $117.2 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily attributable to our investments in crude oil pipelines. For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see “Income Statement Highlights” and “Business Segment Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased a net $986.1 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to: • a $1.06 billion year-to-year decrease in investments for property, plant and equipment (see “Capital Investments” within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information); and • a $51.5 million year-to-year increase in proceeds from asset sales primarily due to the sale of a coal bed natural gas gathering system and related Val Verde treating facility in April 2021; partially offset by • a $141.2 million year-to-year decrease in return of capital cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates primarily attributable to our investments in crude oil pipelines. Financing activities Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $2.55 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The year-to-year increase was primarily due to a net cash outflow of $273.7 million related to debt transactions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a net cash inflow of $2.19 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2021, we repaid $1.33 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, partially offset by the issuance of $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes. In 2020, we issued $4.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, partially offset by the repayment of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. In addition, net repayments of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program were $481.8 million in 2020. Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures Distributable Cash Flow Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our common unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business, including those for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets. 75 Table of Contents We measure available cash by reference to distributable cash flow (“DCF”), which is a non-GAAP cash flow measure. DCF is an important financial measure for our common unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain our declared quarterly cash distributions. DCF is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships since the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Our management compares the DCF we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our common unitholders. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. Our calculation of DCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Based on the level of available cash each quarter, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Enterprise GP has a non-economic ownership interest in the Partnership and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from it based on incentive distribution rights or other equity interests. Our use of DCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure to DCF. For a discussion of net cash flows provided by operating activities, see “Cash Flow Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. The following table summarizes our calculation of DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Net income attributable to common unitholders (GAAP) (1) $ 4,634.1 $ 3,774.7 Adjustments to net income attributable to common unitholders to derive DCF (addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 2,139.8 2,071.9 Cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates (2) 590.1 614.1 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates (583.4 ) (426.1 ) Asset impairment charges 232.8 890.6 Change in fair market value of derivative instruments (27.4 ) (79.3 ) Deferred income tax expense (benefit) 39.8 (147.6 ) Sustaining capital expenditures (3) (430.1 ) (293.6 ) Other, net (4) (126.8 ) 22.5 Operational DCF (5) $ 6,468.9 $ 6,427.2 Proceeds from asset sales 64.3 12.8 Monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges 75.2 (33.3 ) DCF (non-GAAP) $ 6,608.4 $ 6,406.7 Cash distributions paid to common unitholders with respect to period, including distribution equivalent rights on phantom unit awards $ 3,992.6 $ 3,926.8 Cash distribution per common unit declared by Enterprise GP with respect to period (6) $ 1.8150 $ 1.7850 Total DCF retained by the Partnership with respect to period (7) $ 2,615.8 $ 2,479.9 Distribution coverage ratio (8) 1.66 x 1.63 x (1) For a discussion of the primary drivers of changes in our comparative income statement amounts, see “Income Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. (2) Reflects aggregate distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates attributable to both earnings and the return of capital. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures include cash payments and accruals applicable to the period. (4) The year ended December 31, 2021 includes $100 million of trade accounts receivable that we do not expect to collect in the normal billing cycle. (5) Represents DCF before proceeds from asset sales and the monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. (6) See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to the years indicated. (7) Cash retained by the Partnership may be used for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash reduces our reliance on the capital markets. (8) Distribution coverage ratio is determined by dividing DCF by total cash distributions paid to common unitholders and in connection with distribution equivalent rights with respect to the period. 76 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by operating activities to DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 8,512.5 $ 5,891.5 Adjustments to reconcile net cash flows provided by operating activities to DCF (addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Net effect of changes in operating accounts (1,366.7 ) 767.5 Sustaining capital expenditures (430.1 ) (293.6 ) Distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates attributable to the return of capital 46.3 187.5 Proceeds from asset sales 64.3 12.8 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (117.6 ) (110.1 ) Monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges 75.2 (33.3 ) Other, net (175.5 ) (15.6 ) DCF (non-GAAP) $ 6,608.4 $ 6,406.7 Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow (“FCF”), a non-GAAP cash flow measure that is widely used by investors and other participants in the financial community, reflects how much cash flow a business generates during a period after accounting for all capital investments, including those for growth and sustaining capital projects. By comparison, only sustaining capital expenditures are reflected in DCF. We believe that FCF is important to traditional investors since it reflects the amount of cash available for reducing debt, investing in additional capital projects, paying distributions, common unit repurchases and similar matters. Since business partners fund certain capital projects of our consolidated subsidiaries, our determination of FCF reflects the amount of cash contributed from and distributed to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of FCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of FCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure to FCF. FCF fluctuates year-to-year based on a number of factors including earnings, the level of investing activities, the timing of operating cash receipts and payments, and contributions from noncontrolling interests. The following table summarizes our calculation of FCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 8,512.5 $ 5,891.5 Adjustments to net cash flows provided by operating activities to derive FCF (addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Cash used in investing activities (2,134.6 ) (3,120.7 ) Cash contributions from noncontrolling interests 72.4 30.9 Cash distributions paid to noncontrolling interests (153.7 ) (131.3 ) FCF (non-GAAP) $ 6,296.6 $ 2,670.4 The elements used in calculating FCF are sourced directly from our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows presented under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For a discussion of significant year-to-year changes in our cash flow statement amounts, see “Cash Flow Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. 77 Table of Contents Capital Investments The following table summarizes our capital investments for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 2020 Capital investments for property, plant and equipment: (1) Growth capital projects (2) $ 1,807.4 $ 2,985.8 Sustaining capital projects (3) 415.8 302.1 Total $ 2,223.2 $ 3,287.9 Investments in unconsolidated affiliates $ 2.1 $ 15.6 (1) Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented on a cash basis. In total, these amounts represent “Capital expenditures” as presented on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. (2) Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. (3) Sustaining capital projects are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. Sustaining capital expenditures include the costs of major maintenance activities at our reaction-based plants, which are accounted for using the deferral method. We placed a number of growth capital projects into commercial service during 2021 including: • a natural gasoline hydrotreater at our Chambers County complex in October 2021; • the Baymark ethylene pipeline in November 2021; and • the Gillis Lateral natural gas pipeline and its related infrastructure in December 2021. We currently have $2.2 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2023, which includes our PDH 2 facility in the second quarter of 2023. Based on information currently available, we expect our total capital investments for 2022, net of contributions from noncontrolling interests, to approximate $1.9 billion, which reflects growth capital investments of $1.5 billion and sustaining capital expenditures of $350 million. These amounts do not include capital investments associated with SPOT, our proposed deep-water offshore crude oil terminal, which remains subject to governmental approvals. We currently anticipate receiving approval for SPOT as early as mid-2022; however, we can give no assurance as to whether the project will ultimately be approved or the timing of such decision. In January 2022, we announced that an affiliate of Enterprise entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC (“Navitas Midstream”) from an affiliate of Warburg Pincus LLC for $3.25 billion. The purchase price was paid in cash at closing on February 17, 2022. We funded the cash consideration for this acquisition using proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under our commercial paper program and cash on hand. Our forecast of capital investments is dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital investments due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather-related issues and changes in supplier prices. Furthermore, our forecast of capital investments may change due to decisions made by management at a later date, which may include unforeseen acquisition opportunities. Our success in raising capital, including partnering with other companies to share project costs and risks, continues to be a significant factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we expect to make the forecast capital investments noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions. 78 Table of Contents Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2021 with Year Ended December 31, 2020 In total, investments in growth capital projects decreased $1.18 billion year-to-year primarily due to the following: • completion of projects associated with crude oil pipelines (e.g., expansion projects involving the Midland-to-ECHO System and related crude oil-related infrastructure supporting Permian Basin producers), which accounted for a combined $479.4 million decrease; • completion of projects at our Chambers County complex (e.g., the completion of Frac X and Frac XI) during 2020, which accounted for a $346.9 million decrease; • lower investments in Permian Basin natural gas processing facilities and related infrastructure during 2021, which accounted for a $65.3 million decrease; and • lower investments in projects related to our ethylene business during 2021, which accounted for a $57.1 million decrease. Investments attributable to sustaining capital projects increased $113.7 million year-to-year primarily due to the cost of major maintenance activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2021 at certain of our reaction-based plants (PDH 1, octane enhancement and HPIB facilities). These costs accounted for $106.3 million of the year-to-year increase in sustaining capital investments. For reaction-based plants, we use the deferral method when accounting for major maintenance activities. Under the deferral method, major maintenance costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next major overhaul project. We adopted the deferral method for our reaction-based plants in November 2020. Historically, the costs of major maintenance activities attributable to our reaction-based facilities, principally our octane enhancement assets, were not material to our consolidated financial statements. Consolidated Debt At December 31, 2021, the average maturity of EPO’s consolidated debt obligations was approximately 20.7 years. The following table presents the scheduled maturities of principal amounts of EPO’s consolidated debt obligations and associated estimated cash payments for interest at December 31, 2021 for the years indicated (dollars in millions): Total 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Principal amount of senior and junior debt obligations $ 29,821.4 $ 1,400.0 $ 1,250.0 $ 850.0 $ 1,150.0 $ 875.0 $ 24,296.4 Estimated cash payments for interest (1) 28,488.2 1,272.4 1,232.2 1,194.0 1,152.6 1,118.4 22,518.6 (1) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2021, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable interest rates. Our estimated cash payments for interest are influenced by the long-term maturities of our $2.65 billion in junior subordinated notes (due June 2067 through February 2078). The estimated cash payments assume that (i) the junior subordinated notes are not repaid prior to their respective maturity dates and (ii) the amount of interest paid on the junior subordinated notes is based on either (a) the current fixed interest rate charged or (b) the weighted-average variable rate paid in 2021, as applicable, for each note through the respective maturity date. In February 2021, EPO repaid all of the $750.0 million in principal amount of its Senior Notes TT using remaining cash on hand attributable to its August 2020 senior notes offering and proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under its commercial paper program. In March 2021, EPO redeemed all of the $575.0 million outstanding principal amount of its Senior Notes RR one month prior to their scheduled maturity in April 2021. These notes were redeemed at par (i.e., at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount of such notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon) using proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under its commercial paper program. In September 2021, EPO entered into a new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement (the “September 2021 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement”) that replaced its September 2020 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement. The September 2021 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures in September 2022. EPO’s borrowing capacity was unchanged from the prior 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, there are no principal amounts outstanding under this new revolving credit agreement. 79 Table of Contents In September 2021, EPO entered into a new multi-year revolving credit agreement that matures in September 2026 (the “September 2021 Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement”). The September 2021 Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement replaced EPO’s prior multi-year revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in September 2024. EPO’s borrowing capacity under the September 2021 Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement is $3.0 billion (which may be increased by up to $500.0 million to $3.5 billion at EPO’s election, provided certain conditions are met) under the September 2021 Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, there are no principal amounts outstanding under this new revolving credit agreement. In September 2021, EPO issued $1.0 billion in principal amount of senior notes due February 2053 (“Senior Notes EEE”). Senior Notes EEE were issued at 99.170% of their principal amount and have a fixed rate of interest of 3.30% per year. Net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes were used for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments, and the repayment of debt (including the repayment of a portion of our $750.0 million in principal amount of 3.50% Senior Notes VV and a portion of our $650.0 million in principal amount of 4.05% Senior Notes CC, in each case at their maturity in February 2022). For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Credit Ratings As of February 28, 2022, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s, Baa1 from Moody’s and BBB+ from Fitch Ratings. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO’s short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor’s, P-2 from Moody’s and F-2 from Fitch Ratings. EPO’s credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. Product Purchase Commitments The following table presents our unconditional product purchase commitments at December 31, 2021 for the years indicated (dollars in millions): Total 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Product purchase commitments $ 18,805.1 $ 3,420.7 $ 3,070.9 $ 2,807.7 $ 2,348.6 $ 1,988.6 $ 5,168.6 We have long-term product purchase commitments for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and petrochemicals and refined products with third party suppliers. The prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. The preceding table presents our estimated future payment obligations under these contracts based on the contractual price in each agreement at December 31, 2021 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. For additional information regarding our product purchase commitments, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Enterprise Declares Cash Distribution for Fourth Quarter of 2021 On January 6, 2022, we announced that the Board declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.465 per common unit, or $1.86 per unit on an annualized basis, to be paid to the Partnership’s common unitholders with respect to the fourth quarter of 2021. The quarterly distribution was paid on February 11, 2022 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on January 31, 2022. The total amount paid was $1.02 billion, which includes $8.0 million for distribution equivalent rights on phantom unit awards. 80 Table of Contents The payment of quarterly cash distributions is subject to management’s evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in connection with such payments and Board approval. In light of current economic conditions, management will evaluate any future increases in cash distributions on a quarterly basis. Common Unit Repurchases Under 2019 Buyback Program In January 2019, we announced that the Board had approved a $2.0 billion multi-year unit buyback program (the “2019 Buyback Program”), which provides the Partnership with an additional method to return capital to investors. The 2019 Buyback Program authorizes the Partnership to repurchase its common units from time to time, including through open market purchases and negotiated transactions. The timing and pace of buy backs under the program will be determined by a number of factors including (i) our financial performance and flexibility, (ii) organic growth and acquisition opportunities with higher potential returns on investment, (iii) the market price of the Partnership’s common units and implied cash flow yield and (iv) maintaining targeted financial leverage, which is currently a debt-to-normalized adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio in the range of 3.25 to 3.75 times. No time limit has been set for completion of the 2019 Buyback Program, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Partnership repurchased an aggregate 9,891,956 common units under the 2019 Buyback Program through open market purchases during the year ended December 31, 2021. The total cost of these repurchases, including commissions and fees, was $213.9 million. Common units repurchased under the 2019 Buyback Program are immediately cancelled upon acquisition. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining available capacity under the 2019 Buyback Program was $1.52 billion. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following sections discuss the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies: Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Depreciation expense incorporates management estimates regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets into service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected salvage values or (iv) significant changes in our forecast of the remaining life for the associated resource basins, if applicable. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $42.09 billion and $41.91 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.71 billion and $1.68 billion of depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets, which consist of intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand for or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals or refined products. 81 Table of Contents The carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated residual values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset’s estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include the usage of probabilities when there is a range of possible outcomes. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate there is a potential loss in value of the investment attributable to an other-than-temporary decline. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances include continuing operating losses of the entity and/or long-term negative changes in the entity’s industry. In the event we determine that the value of an investment is not recoverable due to an other-than-temporary decline, we record a non-cash impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful lives of the investment’s underlying assets. A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any write-down of the carrying values of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. In 2021 and 2020, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges attributable to assets other than goodwill totaling $232.6 million and $594.3 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For information regarding impairment charges involving property, plant and equipment and investments in unconsolidated affiliates, see Notes 4 and 5, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Valuation and Amortization Methods of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. The method used to value such assets depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns the asset is expected to generate. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to commercial relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. In certain instances, the acquisition of these intangible assets provides us with access to customers in a defined resource basin and is analogous to having a franchise in a particular area. Efficient operation of the acquired assets (e.g., a natural gas gathering system) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing producers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones within our existing asset footprint. The duration of this type of customer relationship is limited by the estimated economic life of the associated resource basin that supports the customer group. When estimating the economic life of a resource basin, we consider a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. In other situations, the acquisition of a customer relationship intangible asset provides us with access to customers whose hydrocarbon volumes are not attributable to specific resource basins. As with basin-specific customer relationships, efficient operation of the associated assets (e.g., a marine terminal that handles volumes originating from multiple sources) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing customers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones. The duration of this type of customer relationship is typically limited to the term of the underlying service contracts, including assumed renewals. The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the estimated economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization period for a basin-specific customer relationship asset is limited by the estimated finite economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basin. 82 Table of Contents Contract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the contract is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a marine terminal, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements. If our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset’s carrying value is not recoverable through its future cash flows, we would be required to reduce the asset’s carrying value to its estimated fair value through the recording of a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was $3.15 billion and $3.31 billion, respectively. We recorded $150.9 million and $143.2 million of amortization expense attributable to intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets Our goodwill balance was $5.45 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Goodwill, which represents the cost of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of its net assets at the acquisition date, is subject to annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment charges represent the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value (including its respective goodwill) exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using accepted valuation techniques, primarily through the use of discounted cash flows (i.e., an income approach to fair value) supplemented by market-based assessments, if available. The estimated fair values of our reporting units incorporate assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the assets and operations that comprise each reporting unit including: (i) discrete financial forecasts for the assets comprising the reporting unit, which, in turn, rely on management’s estimates of long-term operating margins, throughput volumes, capital investments and similar factors; (ii) long-term growth rates for the reporting unit’s cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. The fair value estimates are based on Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy. We believe that the assumptions we use in estimating reporting unit fair values are consistent with those that market participants would use in their fair value estimation process. However, due to uncertainties in the estimation process and volatility in the supply and demand for hydrocarbons and similar risk factors, actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2021. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment test at December 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value (i.e., by at least 10%). For information regarding our goodwill, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses As noted previously, preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect amounts presented in the financial statements. Due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions, we routinely employ estimates in connection with revenue and expense amounts in order to meet our accelerated financial reporting deadlines. Our most significant routine estimates involve revenues and costs of certain natural gas processing facilities, pipeline transportation revenues, fractionation revenues, marketing revenues and related purchases, and power and utility costs. These types of transactions must be estimated since the actual amounts are generally unavailable at the time we complete our accounting close process. The estimates subsequently reverse in the next accounting period when the corresponding actual customer billing or vendor-invoiced amounts are recorded. 83 Table of Contents Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates, which could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Prior to issuing our financial statements, we review our revenue and expense estimates based on currently available information to determine if adjustments are required. Other Matters Parent-Subsidiary Guarantor Relationship The Partnership (the “Parent Guarantor”) has guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on the consolidated debt obligations of EPO (the “Subsidiary Issuer”), with the exception of the remaining debt obligations of TEPPCO Partners, L.P. (collectively, the “Guaranteed Debt”). If EPO were to default on any of its Guaranteed Debt, the Partnership would be responsible for full and unconditional repayment of such obligations. At December 31, 2021, the total amount of Guaranteed Debt was $30.26 billion, which was comprised of $27.17 billion of EPO’s senior notes, $2.63 billion of EPO’s junior subordinated notes and $452.7 million of related accrued interest. The Partnership’s guarantees of EPO’s senior note obligations, commercial paper notes and borrowings under bank credit facilities represent unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Partnership that rank equal in right of payment to all other existing or future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Partnership. In addition, these guarantees effectively rank junior in right of payment to any existing or future indebtedness of the Partnership that is secured and unsubordinated, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Partnership’s guarantees of EPO’s junior subordinated notes represent unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Partnership that rank equal in right of payment to all other existing or future subordinated indebtedness of the Partnership and senior in right of payment to all existing or future equity securities of the Partnership. The Partnership’s guarantees of EPO’s junior subordinated notes effectively rank junior in right of payment to (i) any existing or future indebtedness of the Partnership that is secured, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness and (ii) all other existing or future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Partnership. The Partnership may be released from its guarantee obligations only in connection with EPO’s exercise of its legal or covenant defeasance options as described in the underlying agreements. Selected Financial Information of Obligor Group The following tables present summarized financial information of the Partnership (as Parent Guarantor) and EPO (as Subsidiary Issuer) on a combined basis (collectively, the “Obligor Group”), after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions among the Obligor Group. In accordance with Rule 13.01 of Regulation S-X, the summarized financial information of the Obligor Group excludes the Obligor Group’s equity in income and investments in the consolidated subsidiaries of EPO that are not party to the guarantee obligations (the “Non-Obligor Subsidiaries”). The total carrying value of the Obligor Group’s investments in the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries was $45.92 billion at December 31, 2021. The Obligor Group’s equity in the earnings of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4.49 billion. Although the net assets and earnings of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries are not directly available to the holders of the Guaranteed Debt to satisfy the repayment of such obligations, there are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries to pay distributions or make loans to EPO or the Partnership. EPO exercises control over the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries. We continue to believe that the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership presented under Item 8 of this annual report provide a more appropriate view of our credit standing. Our investment grade credit ratings are based on the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements and not the Obligor Group’s financial information presented below. 84 Table of Contents The following table presents summarized balance sheet information for the combined Obligor Group at December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions): Selected asset information: Current receivables from Non-Obligor Subsidiaries $ 358.4 Other current assets 7,993.7 Long-term receivables from Non-Obligor Subsidiaries 187.3 Other noncurrent assets, excluding investments in Non-Obligor Subsidiaries of $45.92 billion 8,790.8 Selected liability information: Current portion of Guaranteed Debt, including interest of $452.7 million $ 1,852.5 Current payables to Non-Obligor Subsidiaries 1,829.1 Other current liabilities 4,743.2 Noncurrent portion of Guaranteed Debt, principal only 28,406.8 Noncurrent payables to Non-Obligor Subsidiaries 27.0 Other noncurrent liabilities 48.7 Mezzanine equity of Obligor Group: Preferred units $ 49.3 The following table presents summarized income statement information for the combined Obligor Group for the year ended December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions): Revenues from Non-Obligor Subsidiaries $ 13,113.8 Revenues from other sources 16,676.5 Operating income of Obligor Group 1,489.8 Net income of Obligor Group excluding equity in earnings of Non-Obligor Subsidiaries of $4.49 billion 144.9 Related Party Transactions For information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report as well as Part III, Item 13 of this annual report. Income Taxes On September 29, 2021, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a Notice of Selection for Examination to EPO, stating that the IRS has selected its 2019 and 2020 partnership tax returns for examination. On January 6, 2022, the IRS issued a Notice of Selection for Examination to the Partnership stating that the IRS has selected our 2019 and 2020 partnership tax returns for examination. These are routine compliance examinations of various items of income, gain, deductions, losses and credits of EPO and the Partnership, respectively, during the years under examination. The examinations have commenced but are in a preliminary stage, and it is currently not known whether the IRS will propose any adjustments to the 2019 or 2020 partnership tax returns or whether such adjustments, if any, will be material. Insurance For information regarding insurance matters, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 85 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. General In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding and the discount rates used to determine the present values. The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming: • the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk; • the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and • the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period. We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. Accordingly, the nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. Commodity Hedging Activities The price of energy commodities such as natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps and basis swaps. At December 31, 2021, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory and (iii) hedging natural gas processing margins. For a summary of our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 86 Table of Contents Sensitivity Analysis The following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair values of our principal commodity derivative instrument portfolios at the dates indicated (dollars in millions). The fair value information presented in the sensitivity analysis tables excludes the impact of applying Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) Rule 814, which deems that financial instruments cleared by the CME are settled daily in connection with variation margin payments. As a result of this exchange rule, CME-related derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and subject to future commodity price fluctuations until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms. Derivative transactions cleared on exchanges other than the CME (e.g., the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE) continue to be reported on a gross basis.

This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. As a result of market conditions in March 2021, we terminated our entire portfolio of forward-starting swaps, representing an aggregate $1.08 billion in notional value. As of the filing date of this annual report, we do not have any interest rate hedging derivative instruments outstanding.",2023-12-30 21:15:52.091125

Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and assumptions as described in more detail under Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, projected or expected. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this annual report speak only as of the date hereof. Except as required by federal and state securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or any other reason. Overview of Business We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.” Our preferred units are not publicly traded. We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. We are owned by our limited partners (preferred and common unitholders) from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP, which owns a non-economic general partner interest in us, manages our Partnership. We conduct substantially all of our business operations through EPO and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our fully integrated, midstream energy asset network (or “value chain”) links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the U.S., Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. Our midstream energy operations include: • natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; • NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and marine terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases (“LPG”) and ethane); • crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and marine terminals; • propylene production facilities (including propane dehydrogenation (“PDH”) facilities), butane isomerization, octane enhancement, isobutane dehydrogenation (“iBDH”) and high purity isobutylene (“HPIB”) production facilities; • petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, and marine terminals (including those used to export ethylene and polymer grade propylene (“PGP”)); and • a marine transportation business that operates on key U.S. inland and intracoastal waterway systems. The safe operation of our assets is a top priority. We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of the public and those working on our behalf by conducting our business activities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. For additional information, see “Regulatory Matters - Environmental, Safety and Conservation” within Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report. 58 Table of Contents Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the “ASA”) or by other service providers. Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of segment gross operating margin for us. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to certain risks. For information regarding such risks, see “Risk Factors” included under Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. Current Outlook As noted previously, this annual report on Form 10-K, including this update to our outlook on business conditions, contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs and those of Enterprise GP. In addition, it reflects assumptions made by us and information currently available to us, which includes forecast information published by third parties. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information” within this Part II, Item 7 and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, for additional information. The following information presents our current views on key midstream energy supply and demand fundamentals. All references to U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) forecasts and expectations are derived from its February 2023 Short-Term Energy Outlook (“February 2023 STEO”), which was published on February 7, 2023. The level of services we provide and the amount of volumes we purchase and sell are directly affected by changes in supply and demand for hydrocarbon products, which impacts our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, supply and demand for most hydrocarbon products were significantly reduced by the global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequences of containment measures including quarantines, travel restrictions, temporary business closures and similar protective actions. Beginning in late 2020 and throughout 2021, most countries began to gradually reduce mobility restrictions to less stringent methods of COVID-19 containment (e.g., vaccines, mask requirements and social distancing) allowing for the resumption of travel and business activities. These changes, coupled with strong fiscal and economic stimulus programs worldwide, helped bolster an economic recovery in most industrial economies. According to the EIA, U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”) increased 5.9% in 2021 compared to a decrease of 2.8% in 2020. In China, however, strategies for responding to the COVID-19 virus evolved through various stages that ultimately resulted in longer-lasting mobility restrictions than in most other industrialized nations. China adopted a strategy of “zero-COVID” which was based on a strict testing regime intended to pinpoint and then isolate localized clusters of the population infected with the virus. The large-scale lockdowns dramatically slowed Chinese economic output between late 2021 and 2022 and ended up constricting the global supply chain due to the significant reductions in intermediate and finished goods manufactured in China. These reductions occurred just as the rest of the world was demanding increases in goods upon emerging from the pandemic. To make matters worse, Russia invaded the independent country of Ukraine in February 2022 in a major escalation of the conflict that began when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. To counter Russia’s aggression and to prevent a larger regional conflict, members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”), among other countries, imposed sanctions on Russia including limits on exports of crude oil, refined products and natural gas, which sent global Brent crude oil prices soaring from $90 per barrel in early February 2022 to $123 per barrel by early June 2022. Natural gas prices in Europe (based on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility, a virtual trading hub for gas in the Netherlands and primary gas pricing hub for the European gas market) increased even more dramatically from $26 per MMBtu in January 2022 to nearly $100 per MMBtu in August 2022. The higher cost of energy led to government subsidies and the rationing of natural gas, electricity and commodities in Europe, which further reduced global economic output. 59 Table of Contents Several factors, including massive fiscal stimulus from the U.S. and other global governments, increases in energy prices due to higher demand for energy and commodities following the pandemic, the significant global supply chain disruptions caused in large part by lockdowns in China and the reduction in energy supplies due to sanctions on Russia contributed to inflation rates not seen in the U.S. in over four decades. Between June 2021 and June 2022, the inflation rate, as measured by the U.S. Consumer Price Index (“CPI”), increased from 5.4% to a peak of 9.1%. To counteract these pressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank (“the Fed”) increased interest rates by 25 basis points in March 2022 and 50 basis points in May 2022. As inflation continued to rise, the Fed further increased rates by 75 basis points in each of its June, July, September and November meetings during 2022. Under the weight of these pressures, including higher interest rates, the U.S. economy began to experience a slowdown in growth as evidenced by U.S. GDP decreasing 1.6% and 0.6% in the first and second quarters of 2022, respectively. Some economists labeled this period a recession based on the general indicator of two consecutive quarters of negative growth. After peaking in June 2022 at 9.1%, the inflation rate slowly began to moderate in each of the subsequent months, declining to a rate of 6.5% in December 2022. In response to the decline in inflation, the Fed slowed the pace of interest rate increases to 50 basis points in December 2022. Despite these increases, U.S. GDP turned positive again with a growth rate of 3.2% in the third quarter of 2022 and 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022. During the latter half of 2022, energy prices began falling to levels consistent with the start of the year as countries braced for recession, lockdowns in China persisted, the U.S. and International Energy Agency member countries released an aggregate 240 million barrels from their respective strategic petroleum reserves and the U.S. and other non-OPEC countries increased petroleum and other liquids production volumes by approximately 2.0 MMBPD during the second half of 2022 (as reported by the EIA). Energy prices in Europe fell to pre-war levels as a relatively warm winter and alternatives to Russian natural gas from the U.S., Qatar and other exporting nations led to a healthy buildup of storage inventories. Despite sanctions and price caps, Russian crude oil continued to find its way to refineries, albeit with redirected trade flows to China, India and other nations encouraged by the ability to purchase crude oil from Russia at steep discounts. The EIA provided expectations of continued growth in U.S. petroleum and liquid fuels production by nearly 1.0 MMBPD to reach a total of 21.1 MMBPD in 2023. Global production of petroleum and liquid fuels is expected to reach an average of 102.6 MMBPD in 2024, up from 100.0 MMBPD in 2022, driven mostly by growth in U.S. and other non-OPEC production. With respect to demand, the EIA forecasts that global liquids fuel consumption will increase from 99.4 MMBPD in 2022 to 102.3 MMBPD in 2024, driven primarily by growth from China and other non-OECD countries. However, the EIA qualified that this forecast is subject to significant uncertainty over Russia’s oil supply, ongoing concerns about global economic conditions and the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in China. We acknowledge that these uncertainties exist, however, the upside from the recently more upbeat economic news and the continued reopening of the Chinese economy helps us remain constructive on crude oil prices. We are not as constructive on natural gas prices considering we see domestic production rising, consumption declining and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) exports remaining relatively flat until 2025 when additional capacity will be available from new facilities that are expected to be placed in service. A wider crude oil-to-natural gas price spread, however, makes U.S. petrochemicals more cost-advantaged due to locally produced feedstocks more closely aligning with natural gas prices, whereas feedstocks derived from naphtha are more closely aligned with crude oil prices. We believe that these coming additions to petroleum production and consumption levels, along with favorable pricing trends, will create additional opportunities to provide midstream services to our customers while leveraging the strengths of our portfolio, which include: • Our Assets – Our people find innovative ways to optimize our large, integrated and diversified asset base to provide incremental services to customers and to respond to market opportunities. Additional production volumes could lead to higher demand for processing, transportation, fractionation and terminaling services. Storage services provide valuable flexibility for customers seeking to balance supply and demand while also allowing us to capture valuable contango and other marketing opportunities should they arise. U.S. energy and feedstock advantages position our assets well to compete globally for incremental production and processing volumes. To the extent a rising operating cost environment impacts our results, there are typically offsetting benefits either inherent in our business or that result from other steps we take proactively to reduce the impact of inflation on our operating results. These steps include revenue rate escalations based on inflation factors, fuel and electricity surcharges and additional volumetric throughputs often achieved during periods of higher prices. 60 Table of Contents • Our Customers – We have contracted with a large number of quality customers in order to achieve revenue diversification. In 2022, our top 200 largest customers represented 95.3% of consolidated revenues. Based on their respective year-end 2022 debt ratings, 89.6% of revenues from our top 200 customers were either investment grade rated or backed by letters of credit. Additionally, less than 4% of our top 200 customer revenues were attributable to sub-investment grade or non-rated upstream producers. • Our Balance Sheet and Liquidity – We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings on EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt of BBB+, Baa1 and BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively. Based on current market conditions, we believe that we have sufficient consolidated liquidity as of December 31, 2022, which was comprised of $4.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $76 million of unrestricted cash on hand. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 96.2% of our debt portfolio is fixed rate debt at a weighted average cost of 4.5% and weighted-average maturity of 20 years. • Our Access to Capital Markets – EPO successfully issued $1.75 billion in principal amount of senior notes in January 2023. Based on current conditions, we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and/or access to debt capital markets to fund our operations, capital investments and the remaining principal amount of senior notes maturing through 2023 and beyond. Recent Developments Enterprise’s SPOT Project Receives Record of Decision In November 2022, we announced that our Sea Port Oil Terminal (“SPOT”) project received a favorable Record of Decision (“ROD”) from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration in accordance with the provisions of the Deepwater Port Act of 1974. The proposed SPOT project consists of onshore and offshore facilities, including a fixed platform located approximately 30 nautical miles off the Texas coast in approximately 115 feet of water. SPOT is designed to load VLCCs and other crude oil tankers at rates of approximately 85,000 barrels per hour. The platform will be connected to an onshore storage facility with approximately 4.8 MMBbls of capacity in Brazoria County, Texas, by two 36-inch, bi-directional pipelines. Additionally, the SPOT project includes state-of-the-art pipeline control, vapor recovery and leak detection systems that are designed to minimize emissions. The receipt of the ROD is a significant milestone in the process to obtain a license for SPOT under the Deepwater Port Act. Remaining conditions that we must address and satisfy to obtain approval for the license issuance include routine construction, operating and decommissioning guarantees, submission of public outreach, wetland restoration and volatile organic compound (“VOC”) monitoring plans, and other state approvals. We expect to satisfy these remaining conditions in 2023; however, we can give no assurance as to when or whether the project will ultimately be authorized to begin construction or operation. Enterprise Announces Three Expansions in the Permian Basin In August 2022, we announced the following three new projects to support ongoing production growth in the Permian Basin (including their respective scheduled completion dates): • our Leonidas natural gas processing plant, which was previously referred to as Plant 7, in the Midland Basin (first quarter of 2024); • our Mentone III natural gas processing plant in the Delaware Basin (first quarter of 2024); and • a 275 MBPD expansion of our Shin Oak NGL Pipeline (first half of 2025). 61 Table of Contents Enterprise and OLCV Sign Letter of Intent for Gulf Coast CO2 Transportation and Sequestration Project In April 2022, Enterprise and Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, LLC (“OLCV”), a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, announced that we have executed a letter of intent to work toward a potential carbon dioxide (“CO2”) transportation and sequestration solution for the Texas Gulf Coast. The joint project would initially be focused on providing services to emitters in the industrial corridors from the greater Houston to Beaumont/Port Arthur areas. The initiative would combine Enterprise’s leadership position in the midstream energy sector with OLCV’s extensive experience in subsurface characterization and CO2 sequestration. Enterprise would develop the CO2 aggregation and transportation network utilizing a combination of new and existing pipelines along its expansive Gulf Coast footprint. OLCV, through its 1PointFive business unit, is developing sequestration hubs on the Gulf Coast and across the U.S., some of which are expected to be anchored by direct air capture facilities. The hubs will provide access to high quality pore space and efficient transportation infrastructure, bringing more options to emitters looking to explore viable carbon management strategies. Enterprise and OLCV have begun exploring the commercialization of the potential joint service offering with customers. Enterprise Announces Seven New Projects During Analyst and Investor Day On April 12, 2022, Enterprise hosted a meeting with securities analysts and investors where we announced seven new projects that we expect will be completed by 2025. The announced projects included the following (including their respective scheduled completion dates): • a 400 MMcf/d expansion of our Acadian Gas System (second quarter of 2023); • our Poseidon natural gas processing plant, which was previously referred to as Plant 6, in the Midland Basin (third quarter of 2023); • a twelfth NGL fractionator (“Frac XII”) in Chambers County, Texas (third quarter of 2023); • our Mentone II natural gas processing plant in the Delaware Basin (fourth quarter of 2023); • our Texas Western Products System, created by repurposing a portion of our Mid-America Pipeline System’s Rocky Mountain segment and adding westbound service to our Chaparral Pipeline business to transport refined products from the U.S. Gulf Coast to markets in West Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah (fourth quarter of 2023); • an Ethane Export Terminal located in Orange County, Texas (2025); and • an expansion of our Morgan’s Point terminal to increase ethylene export capacity (2024 and 2025). Enterprise Announces Acquisition of Navitas Midstream In January 2022, we announced that an affiliate of Enterprise entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC (“Navitas Midstream”) from an affiliate of Warburg Pincus LLC in a debt-free transaction for $3.25 billion in cash consideration (subject to adjustment in accordance with the agreement). Navitas Midstream’s assets include approximately 1,750 miles of pipelines and over 1.0 Bcf/d of cryogenic natural gas processing capacity. The purchase price was paid in cash at closing on February 17, 2022. We funded the cash consideration for this acquisition using proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program and cash on hand. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding this acquisition. 62 Table of Contents Selected Energy Commodity Price Data The following table presents selected average index prices for natural gas and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods indicated: Polymer Refinery Indicative Gas Natural Normal Natural Grade Grade Processing Gas, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Gasoline, Propylene, Propylene, Gross Spread $/MMBtu $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/gallon $/pound $/pound $/gallon (1) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (3) (3) (4) 2021 by quarter: 1st Quarter $2.71 $0.24 $0.89 $0.94 $0.93 $1.33 $0.73 $0.44 $0.38 2nd Quarter $2.83 $0.26 $0.87 $0.97 $0.98 $1.46 $0.67 $0.27 $0.41 3rd Quarter $4.02 $0.35 $1.16 $1.34 $1.34 $1.62 $0.82 $0.36 $0.51 4th Quarter $5.84 $0.39 $1.24 $1.46 $1.46 $1.82 $0.66 $0.33 $0.41 2021 Averages $3.85 $0.31 $1.04 $1.18 $1.18 $1.56 $0.72 $0.35 $0.43 2022 by quarter: 1st Quarter $4.96 $0.40 $1.30 $1.59 $1.60 $2.21 $0.63 $0.39 $0.55 2nd Quarter $7.17 $0.59 $1.24 $1.50 $1.68 $2.17 $0.61 $0.40 $0.46 3rd Quarter $8.20 $0.55 $1.08 $1.19 $1.44 $1.72 $0.47 $0.28 $0.26 4th Quarter $6.26 $0.39 $0.79 $0.97 $1.03 $1.54 $0.32 $0.18 $0.17 2022 Averages $6.65 $0.48 $1.10 $1.31 $1.44 $1.91 $0.51 $0.31 $0.36 (1) Natural gas prices are based on Henry-Hub Inside FERC commercial index prices as reported by Platts, which is a division of S&P Global, Inc.

Refinery grade propylene (“RGP”) prices represent weighted-average spot prices for such product as reported by IHS Markit (“IHS”). (4) The “Indicative Gas Processing Gross Spread” represents our generic estimate of the gross economic benefit from extracting NGLs from natural gas production based on certain pricing assumptions. Specifically, it is the amount by which the assumed economic value of a composite gallon of NGLs in Chambers County, Texas exceeds the value of the equivalent amount of energy in natural gas at Henry Hub, Louisiana. Our estimate of the indicative spread does not consider the operating costs incurred by a natural gas processing facility to extract the NGLs nor the transportation and fractionation costs to deliver the NGLs to market. In addition, the actual gas processing spread earned at each plant is further influenced by regional pricing and extraction dynamics. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.91 per gallon in 2022 versus $0.75 per gallon for 2021.

An increase in our consolidated marketing revenues due to higher energy commodity sales prices may not result in an increase in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also be expected to increase due to comparable increases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same type of relationship would be true in the case of lower energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs. We attempt to mitigate commodity price exposure through our hedging activities and the use of fee-based arrangements. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” under Part II, Item 7A of this annual report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities. Impact of Inflation After being relatively moderate in recent years, inflation in the United States increased significantly in late 2021 into 2022. This rise in inflation, coupled with supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and increased commodity prices, has generally resulted in higher costs in 2022. However, to the extent that a rising cost environment impacts our results, there are typically offsetting benefits either inherent in our business or that result from other steps we take proactively to reduce the impact of inflation on our net operating results. These benefits include: (1) provisions included in our long-term fee-based revenue contracts that offset cost increases in the form of rate escalations based on positive changes in the U.S. Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index for Finished Goods or other factors; (2) provisions in other revenue contracts that enable us to pass through higher energy costs to customers in the form of gas, electricity and fuel rebills or surcharges; and (3) higher commodity prices, which generally enhance our results in the form of increased volumetric throughput and demand for our services. Additionally, we take measures to mitigate the impact of cost increases in certain commodities, including a portion of our electricity needs, using fixed-price, term purchase agreements. For these reasons, the increased cost environment, caused in part by inflation, has not had a material impact on our historical results of operations for the periods presented in this report. However, a significant or prolonged period of high inflation could adversely impact our results if costs were to increase at a rate greater than the increase in the revenues we receive. See “Capital Investments” within this Part II, Item 7 for a discussion of the impact of inflation on our capital investment decisions. Additionally, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors - Changes in price levels could negatively impact our revenue, our expenses, or both, which could adversely affect our business.” 64 Table of Contents Income Statement Highlights The following table summarizes the key components of our consolidated results of operations for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2022 2021 Revenues $ 58,186 $ 40,807 Costs and expenses: Operating costs and expenses: Cost of sales 45,836 29,887 Other operating costs and expenses 3,454 2,915 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 2,158 2,038 Asset impairment charges 53 233 Net losses attributable to asset sales and related matters 1 5 Total operating costs and expenses 51,502 35,078 General and administrative costs 241 209 Total costs and expenses 51,743 35,287 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 464 583 Operating income 6,907 6,103 Other income (expense): Interest expense (1,244 ) (1,283 ) Other, net 34 5 Total other expense, net (1,210 ) (1,278 ) Income before income taxes 5,697 4,825 Provision for income taxes (82 ) (70 ) Net income 5,615 4,755 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (125 ) (117 ) Net income attributable to preferred units (3 ) (4 ) Net income attributable to common unitholders $ 5,487 $ 4,634 Revenues The following table presents each business segment’s contribution to consolidated revenues for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2022 2021 NGL Pipelines & Services: Sales of NGLs and related products $ 21,307 $ 13,716 Midstream services 2,952 2,586 Total 24,259 16,302 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services: Sales of crude oil 17,301 9,519 Midstream services 1,260 1,383 Total 18,561 10,902 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services: Sales of natural gas 5,019 3,413 Midstream services 1,241 987 Total 6,260 4,400 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services: Sales of petrochemicals and refined products 8,003 8,196 Midstream services 1,103 1,007 Total 9,106 9,203 Total consolidated revenues $ 58,186 $ 40,807 65 Table of Contents Total revenues for 2022 increased $17.4 billion when compared to 2021 primarily due to a $16.8 billion increase in marketing revenues. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs, crude oil and natural gas increased a combined $17.0 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales prices, which accounted for a $12.0 billion increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $5.0 billion increase. Revenues from midstream services for 2022 increased $593 million when compared to 2021. Revenues from our natural gas processing facilities increased $343 million year-to-year primarily due to higher market values for the equity NGL-equivalent production volumes we receive as non-cash consideration for processing services. Revenues from our natural gas pipeline assets increased $251 million year-to-year primarily due to the addition of the Midland Basin Gathering System from the Navitas Midstream acquisition and higher demand for natural gas transportation and gathering services in Texas and New Mexico. Revenues from our NGL fractionators increased $51 million year-to-year primarily due to higher fractionation fee revenues at our Chambers County NGL fractionation complex. Revenues from our ethylene export terminal increased $34 million year-to-year primarily due to higher loading fee revenues. Lastly, revenues from our crude oil pipeline assets decreased $122 million year-to-year primarily due to lower deficiency revenues as a result of the expiration of minimum volume commitments under certain long-term gathering agreements on our EFS Midstream System. For additional information regarding our revenues, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Operating costs and expenses Total operating costs and expenses for 2022 increased $16.4 billion when compared to 2021. Cost of sales Cost of sales for 2022 increased $15.9 billion when compared to 2021. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs, crude oil and natural gas increased a combined $16.5 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher average purchase prices, which accounted for a $12.1 billion increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $4.4 billion increase. Other operating costs and expenses Other operating costs and expenses increased $539 million year-to-year primarily due to higher utility, employee compensation and rental costs. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $120 million year-to-year. The addition of assets attributable to the Navitas Midstream acquisition accounted for $86 million of the year-to-year increase. The remainder of the year-to-year increase is due to assets placed into full or limited service since the first quarter of 2021 (e.g., the Gillis Lateral natural gas pipeline and the Baymark ethylene pipeline) and major maintenance activities accounted for under the deferral method. Asset impairment charges Non-cash asset impairment charges decreased $180 million year-to-year primarily due to the partial impairment of our marine transportation business in December 2021, which accounted for $114 million of expense, and the sale of a coal bed natural gas gathering system and related Val Verde treating facility in March 2021, both of which were components of our San Juan Gathering System, which accounted for an additional $44 million of expense. For information regarding these charges, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. General and administrative costs General and administrative costs for 2022 increased $32 million when compared to 2021 primarily due to higher employee compensation and professional services costs. Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2022 decreased $119 million when compared to 2021 primarily due to lower earnings from investments in crude oil pipelines. 66 Table of Contents Operating income Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $804 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. Interest expense The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2022 2021 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding (1) $ 1,288 $ 1,299 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization 19 38 Interest costs capitalized in connection with construction projects (2) (90 ) (80 ) Other (3) 27 26 Total $ 1,244 $ 1,283 (1) The weighted-average interest rates on debt principal outstanding were 4.33% and 4.35% during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (2) We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital investment levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. (3) Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is a key driver of interest expense, decreased $11 million year-to-year primarily due to the retirement of $1.4 billion of fixed-rate senior notes in February 2022 and the redemption of $350 million of variable-rate junior subordinated notes in August 2022 using a combination of available cash, commercial paper and proceeds from a senior notes issuance in September 2021 with a lower interest rate. These actions resulted in lower weighted-average interest rates on outstanding debt obligations during the comparative years. For information regarding our debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Other, net Other non-operating income for 2022 includes $16 million attributable to the partial recovery of attorneys’ fees related to the settlement of the PDH 1 litigation in November 2022. For additional information regarding this litigation, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Income taxes Our provision for income taxes for 2022 increased $12 million when compared to 2021 primarily due to changes in income tax expense related to state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (“Texas Margin Tax”). For information regarding our income taxes, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 67 Table of Contents Business Segment Highlights Our operations are reported under four business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services and (iv) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold. The following information summarizes the assets and operations of each business segment: • Our NGL Pipelines & Services business segment includes our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities, NGL pipelines, NGL fractionation facilities, NGL and related product storage facilities, and NGL marine terminals. • Our Crude Oil Pipelines & Services business segment includes our crude oil pipelines, crude oil storage and marine terminals, and related crude oil marketing activities. • Our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services business segment includes our natural gas pipeline systems that provide for the gathering, treating and transportation of natural gas. This segment also includes our natural gas marketing activities. • Our Petrochemical & Refined Products Services business segment includes our (i) propylene production facilities, which include propylene fractionation units and a PDH facility, and related pipelines and marketing activities, (ii) butane isomerization complex and related deisobutanizer (“DIB”) operations, (iii) octane enhancement, iBDH and HPIB production facilities, (iv) refined products pipelines, terminals and related marketing activities, (v) an ethylene export terminal and related operations; and (vi) marine transportation business. We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The following table presents gross operating margin by segment and total gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measure, for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2022 2021 Gross operating margin by segment: NGL Pipelines & Services $ 5,142 $ 4,316 Crude Oil Pipelines & Services 1,655 1,680 Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 1,042 1,155 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services 1,517 1,357 Total segment gross operating margin (1) 9,356 8,508 Net adjustment for shipper make-up rights (47 ) 53 Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 9,309 $ 8,561 (1) Within the context of this table, total segment gross operating margin represents a subtotal and corresponds to measures similarly titled within our business segment disclosures found under Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Total gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Total gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of gross operating margin may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment gross operating margin for NGL Pipelines & Services and Crude Oil Pipelines & Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights that are included in management’s evaluation of segment results. However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total gross operating margin. 68 Table of Contents The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income. For a discussion of operating income and its components, see the previous section titled “Income Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income to total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2022 2021 Operating income $ 6,907 $ 6,103 Adjustments to reconcile operating income to total gross operating margin(addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses (1) 2,107 2,011 Asset impairment charges in operating costs and expenses 53 233 Net losses attributable to asset sales and related matters in operatingcosts and expenses 1 5 General and administrative costs 241 209 Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP) $ 9,309 $ 8,561 (1) Excludes amortization of major maintenance costs for reaction-based plants, which are a component of gross operating margin. Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin for us. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold. Winter Storms Uri and Viola in 2021 Two major winter storms, Uri and Viola, impacted Texas and the southern U.S. in mid-February 2021 (the “February 2021 winter storms”). The storms had a major impact on the electric power grid in Texas, which resulted in widespread power outages. Voluntarily and in accordance with our agreements with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (“ERCOT”), we temporarily shut down our non-essential plants and other operations in Texas to support residential power consumption. Those Texas assets that remained operational (e.g., our natural gas processing plants, storage facilities and Texas Intrastate System) were impacted by rolling blackouts. During and following the storms, many of our customers also experienced downtime due to freeze-related damage and repairs that impacted our volumes. The economic impacts of these disruptions, higher power and natural gas costs, as well as losses on natural gas hedges and lower volumes, were mitigated by sales of natural gas to electricity generators, natural gas utilities and industrial customers to assist them in meeting their requirements. Estimated Impact of Hurricane Ida on Results for 2021 In late August 2021, southern Louisiana and Mississippi, including its critical energy infrastructure, were impacted by the cumulative effects of Hurricane Ida. Impacts on the energy industry included, but were not limited to, severe flooding and limited access to facilities, disruptions to offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico, and reduced energy demand from area refineries and petrochemical facilities. Our plant, pipeline and storage assets in southern Louisiana and Mississippi did not experience significant property damage, and all assets have since returned to normal operations. Our volumes impacted by third-party facility disruptions also returned to normal levels as repairs were completed and production was fully restored. We estimate that Hurricane Ida reduced our gross operating margin for the third and fourth quarters of 2021 by approximately $34 million, almost all of which was related to our Louisiana and Mississippi processing, transportation and fractionation assets and related marketing activities, which are a component of our NGL Pipelines & Services segment. Of this amount, approximately $29 million represents the combined net impact of lower than anticipated volumes and lost business opportunities. The remaining $5 million represents expenses, net of property damage insurance reimbursements, which we incurred during the year in connection with hurricane-related repair and recovery costs. 69 Table of Contents NGL Pipelines & Services The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2022 2021 Segment gross operating margin: Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities $ 1,946 $ 1,135 NGL pipelines, storage and terminals 2,362 2,324 NGL fractionation 834 857 Total $ 5,142 $ 4,316 Selected volumetric data: NGL pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD) 3,703 3,412 NGL marine terminal volumes (MBPD) 723 658 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 1,339 1,253 Equity NGL-equivalent production volumes (MBPD) (1) 182 167 Fee-based natural gas processing volumes (MMcf/d) (2, 3) 5,182 4,057 (1) Primarily represents the NGL and condensate volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities. The total equity NGL-equivalent production volumes also include residue natural gas volumes from our natural gas processing business. (2) Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our natural gas processing plants. (3) Fee-based natural gas processing volumes are measured at either the wellhead or plant inlet in MMcf/d. Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $811 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Our Midland Basin natural gas processing facilities, which represent the natural gas processing facilities we acquired in February 2022 as part of our acquisition of Navitas Midstream, generated gross operating margin of $385 million. Fee-based natural gas processing volumes and equity NGL-equivalent production volumes at these facilities were 940 MMcf/d and 53 MBPD, respectively, following the acquisition date. Our Midland Basin natural gas gathering activities are discussed under the Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment. Gross operating margin from our Delaware Basin natural gas processing facilities, which represent our legacy Permian Basin processing facilities, increased $182 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $152 million increase, and a 180 MMcf/d increase in fee-based natural gas processing volumes, which accounted for an additional $29 million increase. Equity NGL-equivalent production volumes at these facilities decreased 27 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our South Texas natural gas processing facilities increased $86 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities). Fee-based natural gas processing volumes increased 96 MMcf/d and equity NGL-equivalent production volumes decreased 1 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Rockies natural gas processing facilities (Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco) increased a net $86 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $71 million increase, and higher average processing fees, which accounted for an additional $20 million increase, partially offset by an 8 MBPD combined decrease in equity NGL-equivalent production volumes, which accounted for a $10 million decrease. On a combined basis, fee-based natural gas processing volumes decreased 47 MMcf/d year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased a net $71 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for a $135 million increase, and an increase in sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $29 million increase, partially offset by lower non-cash, mark-to-market earnings, which accounted for a $98 million decrease. The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin can be primarily attributed to results from marketing strategies that seek to optimize our storage, plant and transportation assets. 70 Table of Contents NGL pipelines, storage and terminals Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines, storage and terminal assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $38 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

Marine transportation and other services Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other services increased $31 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average fees and fleet utilization rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe that the Partnership and its consolidated businesses will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund their capital investments and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. At December 31, 2022, we had $4.1 billion of consolidated liquidity. This amount was comprised of $4.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities, which is the net of $4.5 billion of total borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $495 million outstanding under EPO’s commercial paper program, and $76 million of unrestricted cash on hand. We may issue debt and equity securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital investments. We have a universal shelf registration statement (the “2021 Shelf”) on file with the SEC that allows the Partnership and EPO to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. 75 Table of Contents Cash Flow Statement Highlights The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2022 2021 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 8,039 $ 8,513 Cash used in investing activities 4,954 2,135 Cash used in financing activities 5,844 4,571 Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. Changes in energy commodity prices may impact the demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products, which could impact sales of our products and the demand for our midstream services. Changes in demand for our products and services may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, public health emergencies, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels. We may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their contractual obligations to us in connection with our marketing activities and long-term take-or-pay agreements. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts: Operating activities Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased a net $474 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to: • a $1.4 billion year-to-year decrease from changes in operating accounts primarily due to the use of working capital employed in our marketing activities, which includes the impact of (i) fluctuations in commodity prices, (ii) timing of our inventory purchase and sale strategies, and (iii) changes in margin deposit requirements associated with our commodity derivative instruments; partially offset by • a $1.0 billion year-to-year increase resulting from higher partnership earnings (determined by adjusting our $860 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows). For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see “Income Statement Highlights” and “Business Segment Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased a net $2.8 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to: • a net $3.2 billion cash outflow in February 2022 in connection with the acquisition of Navitas Midstream; partially offset by • a $259 million year-to-year decrease in investments for property, plant and equipment (see “Capital Investments” within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information). 76 Table of Contents Financing activities Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $1.3 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to: • a net cash outflow of $1.3 billion related to debt transactions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a net cash outflow of $273 million related to debt transactions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021. In 2022 we repaid $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of senior and junior subordinated notes, partially offset by net issuances of $495 million under EPO’s commercial paper program. In 2021, we repaid $1.33 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, partially offset by the issuance of $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes; and • a $165 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to common unitholders primarily attributable to increases in the quarterly cash distribution rate per unit. Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures Distributable Cash Flow Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our common unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business, including those for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets. We measure available cash by reference to distributable cash flow (“DCF”), which is a non-GAAP cash flow measure. DCF is an important financial measure for our common unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain our declared quarterly cash distributions. DCF is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships since the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Our management compares the DCF we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our common unitholders. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. Our calculation of DCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Based on the level of available cash each quarter, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Enterprise GP has a non-economic ownership interest in the Partnership and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from it based on incentive distribution rights or other equity interests. Our use of DCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure to DCF. For a discussion of net cash flows provided by operating activities, see “Cash Flow Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. 77 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our calculation of DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2022 2021 Net income attributable to common unitholders (GAAP) (1) $ 5,487 $ 4,634 Adjustments to net income attributable to common unitholders to derive DCF (addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses 2,245 2,140 Cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates (2) 544 590 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates (464 ) (583 ) Asset impairment charges 53 233 Change in fair market value of derivative instruments 78 (27 ) Deferred income tax expense 60 40 Sustaining capital expenditures (3) (372 ) (430 ) Other, net (4) (2 ) (128 ) Operational DCF (5) $ 7,629 $ 6,469 Proceeds from asset sales and other matters 122 64 Monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges – 75 DCF (non-GAAP) $ 7,751 $ 6,608 Cash distributions paid to common unitholders with respect to period, including distribution equivalent rights on phantom unit awards $ 4,181 $ 3,992 Cash distribution per common unit declared by Enterprise GP with respect to period (6) $ 1.9050 $ 1.8150 Total DCF retained by the Partnership with respect to period (7) $ 3,570 $ 2,616 Distribution coverage ratio (8) 1.85 x 1.66 x (1) For a discussion of the primary drivers of changes in our comparative income statement amounts, see “Income Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7. (2) Reflects aggregate distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates attributable to both earnings and the return of capital. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures include cash payments and accruals applicable to the period. (4) The year ended December 31, 2021 includes $100 million of trade accounts receivable that we do not expect to collect in the normal billing cycle. (5) Represents DCF before proceeds from asset sales and the monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. (6) See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to the years indicated. (7) Cash retained by the Partnership may be used for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash reduces our reliance on the capital markets. (8) Distribution coverage ratio is determined by dividing DCF by total cash distributions paid to common unitholders and in connection with distribution equivalent rights with respect to the period. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by operating activities to DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2022 2021 Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 8,039 $ 8,513 Adjustments to reconcile net cash flows provided by operating activities to DCF (addition or subtraction indicated by sign): Net effect of changes in operating accounts 54 (1,366 ) Sustaining capital expenditures (372 ) (430 ) Distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates attributable to the return of capital 98 46 Proceeds from asset sales and other matters 122 64 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (125 ) (117 ) Monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges – 75 Other, net (65 ) (177 ) DCF (non-GAAP) $ 7,751 $ 6,608 78 Table of Contents Capital Investments We have approximately $5.8 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2025 including the following projects (including their respective scheduled completion dates): • natural gas gathering expansion projects in the Delaware and Midland Basins (2023); • our PDH 2 facility (second quarter of 2023); • a 400 MMcf/d expansion of our Acadian Gas System (second quarter of 2023); • our Poseidon natural gas processing plant in the Midland Basin (third quarter of 2023); • a twelfth NGL fractionator (“Frac XII”) in Chambers County, Texas (third quarter of 2023); • our Mentone II natural gas processing plant in the Delaware Basin (fourth quarter of 2023); • our Texas Western Products System, created by repurposing a portion of our Mid-America Pipeline System’s Rocky Mountain segment and adding westbound service to our Chaparral Pipeline business to transport refined products from the U.S. Gulf Coast to markets in West Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah (fourth quarter of 2023); • our Mentone III natural gas processing plant in the Delaware Basin (first quarter of 2024); • our Leonidas natural gas processing plant in the Midland Basin (first quarter of 2024); • the expansion of our Shin Oak NGL Pipeline (first half of 2025); • an Ethane Export Terminal located in Orange County, Texas (2025); and • an expansion of our Morgan’s Point terminal to increase ethylene export capacity (2024 and 2025). In February 2022, we acquired Navitas Midstream from an affiliate of Warburg Pincus LLC for $3.2 billion in net cash consideration, which was funded using proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program and cash on hand. Shortly after closing on this transaction, we completed construction of the Leiker Plant and placed it into service in March 2022. Based on information currently available, we expect our total capital investments for 2023, net of contributions from noncontrolling interests, to approximate $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, which reflects growth capital investments of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion and sustaining capital expenditures of $400 million. These amounts do not include capital investments associated with SPOT, our proposed deep-water offshore crude oil terminal, which remains subject to state and federal permitting, mitigation and related requirements. We received a favorable ROD from the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration for SPOT during the fourth quarter of 2022 and expect to satisfy the remaining conditions to obtain the deep-water port license in 2023; however, we can give no assurance as to when or whether the project will ultimately be authorized to begin construction or operation. Our forecast of capital investments is dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital investments due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather-related issues and changes in supplier prices resulting from raw material or labor shortages, supply chain disruptions or inflation. Furthermore, our forecast of capital investments may change over time based on future decisions by management, which may include changing the scope or timing of projects or cancelling projects altogether. Our success in raising capital, having the ability to increase revenues commensurate with cost increases and our ability to partner with other companies to share project costs and risks, continue to be significant factors in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we currently expect to make the forecast capital investments noted above, we may revise our plans in response to changes in economic and capital market conditions. 79 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our capital investments for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2022 2021 Capital investments for property, plant and equipment: (1) Growth capital projects (2) $ 1,606 $ 1,807 Sustaining capital projects (3) 358 416 Total $ 1,964 $ 2,223 Cash used for business combinations, net (4) $ 3,204 $ – Investments in unconsolidated affiliates $ 1 $ 2 (1) Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented on a cash basis. In total, these amounts represent “Capital expenditures” as presented on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. (2) Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. (3) Sustaining capital projects are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. Sustaining capital expenditures include the costs of major maintenance activities at our reaction-based plants, which are accounted for using the deferral method. (4) Amount for the year ended December 31, 2022 represents net cash used for the acquisition of Navitas Midstream, which closed on February 17, 2022. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2022 with Year Ended December 31, 2021 In total, investments in growth capital projects decreased a net $201 million year-to-year primarily due to the following: • lower investments at our Chambers County complex (e.g., completion of our natural gasoline hydrotreater in October 2021 and a year-to-year decrease in spending on our PDH 2 facility, partially offset by a year-to-year increase in spending on Frac XII), which accounted for a net $195 million decrease; • completion of our Gillis Lateral natural gas pipeline in December 2021, which accounted for a $186 million decrease; • completion of pipeline projects connecting our Chambers County complex with Gulf Coast assets, which accounted for a $138 million decrease; • lower investments in projects attributable to our ethylene business (e.g., completion of our Baymark ethylene pipeline in November 2021), which accounted for a $99 million decrease; partially offset by • higher investments in natural gas processing and gathering projects in the Permian Basin (e.g., construction of four natural gas processing plants and related gathering systems), which accounted for a $289 million increase; and • the purchase of approximately 580 miles of pipelines and related assets for $160 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. The purchase of these assets allow us to optimize and expand our NGL and petrochemical systems on the Gulf Coast. Investments attributable to sustaining capital projects decreased $58 million year-to-year primarily due to lower major maintenance activities performed at certain of our reaction-based plants (PDH 1, octane enhancement and HPIB facilities) and fluctuations in timing and costs of pipeline integrity and similar projects. 80 Table of Contents Consolidated Debt At December 31, 2022, the average maturity of EPO’s consolidated debt obligations was approximately 20.0 years. The following table presents the scheduled maturities of principal amounts of EPO’s consolidated debt obligations and associated estimated cash payments for interest at December 31, 2022 for the years indicated (dollars in millions): Total 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Principal amount of debt obligations $ 28,566 $ 1,745 $ 850 $ 1,150 $ 875 $ 575 $ 23,371 Estimated cash payments for interest (1) 27,324 1,239 1,200 1,158 1,124 1,100 21,503 (1) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2022, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable interest rates. Our estimated cash payments for interest are influenced by the long-term maturities of our $2.3 billion in junior subordinated notes (due June 2067 through February 2078). The estimated cash payments assume that (i) the junior subordinated notes are not repaid prior to their respective maturity dates and (ii) the amount of interest paid on the junior subordinated notes is based on either (a) the current fixed interest rate charged or (b) the weighted-average variable rate paid in 2022, as applicable, for each note through the respective maturity date. In February 2022, EPO repaid all of the $750 million and $650 million in principal amount of its Senior Notes VV and CC, respectively, using remaining cash on hand attributable to its September 2021 senior notes offering and proceeds from issuances under its commercial paper program. In August 2022, EPO redeemed $350 million of the $700 million outstanding principal amount of its Junior Subordinated Notes D at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. The redemption was funded using cash on hand and proceeds from issuances under EPO’s commercial paper program. In September 2022, EPO entered into a new $1.5 billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement (the “September 2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement”) that replaced its September 2021 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement. The September 2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures in September 2023. EPO’s borrowing capacity was unchanged from the prior 364-day revolving credit agreement. As of December 31, 2022, there are no principal amounts outstanding under this new revolving credit agreement. In January 2023, EPO issued $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $750 million principal amount of senior notes due January 2026 (“Senior Notes FFF”) and (ii) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2033 (“Senior Notes GGG”). Senior Notes FFF were issued at 99.893% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 5.05% per year. Senior Notes GGG were issued at 99.803% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 5.35% per year. Net proceeds from this offering will be used by EPO for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments, and the repayment of debt (including the repayment of all or a portion of our $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.35% Senior Notes HH at their maturity in March 2023 and amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program). For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Credit Ratings As of February 28, 2023, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s, Baa1 from Moody’s and BBB+ from Fitch Ratings. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO’s short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor’s, P-2 from Moody’s and F-2 from Fitch Ratings. EPO’s credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. 81 Table of Contents Product Purchase Commitments The following table presents our unconditional product purchase commitments at December 31, 2022 for the years indicated (dollars in millions): Total 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Product purchase commitments $ 17,644 $ 3,401 $ 3,338 $ 2,960 $ 2,318 $ 2,205 $ 3,422 We have long-term product purchase commitments for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and petrochemicals and refined products with third party suppliers. The prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. The preceding table presents our estimated future payment obligations under these contracts based on the contractual price in each agreement at December 31, 2022 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. For additional information regarding our product purchase commitments, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Enterprise Declares Cash Distribution for Fourth Quarter of 2022 On January 5, 2023, we announced that the Board declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.49 per common unit, or $1.96 per common unit on an annualized basis, to be paid to the Partnership’s common unitholders with respect to the fourth quarter of 2022. The quarterly distribution was paid on February 14, 2023 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on January 31, 2023. The total amount paid was $1.07 billion, which includes $9 million for distribution equivalent rights on phantom unit awards. The payment of quarterly cash distributions is subject to management’s evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in connection with such payments and Board approval. Management will evaluate any future increases in cash distributions on a quarterly basis. Common Unit Repurchases Under 2019 Buyback Program In January 2019, we announced that the Board had approved a $2.0 billion multi-year unit buyback program (the “2019 Buyback Program”), which provides the Partnership with an additional method to return capital to investors. The 2019 Buyback Program authorizes the Partnership to repurchase its common units from time to time, including through open market purchases and negotiated transactions. The timing and pace of buy backs under the program will be determined by a number of factors including (i) our financial performance and flexibility, (ii) organic growth and acquisition opportunities with higher potential returns on investment, (iii) the market price of the Partnership’s common units and implied cash flow yield and (iv) maintaining targeted financial leverage, which is currently a debt-to-normalized adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio in the range of 2.75 to 3.25 times. No time limit has been set for completion of the 2019 Buyback Program, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Partnership repurchased an aggregate 10,166,923 common units under the 2019 Buyback Program through open market purchases during the year ended December 31, 2022. The total cost of these repurchases, including commissions and fees, was $250 million. Common units repurchased under the 2019 Buyback Program are immediately cancelled upon acquisition. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining available capacity under the 2019 Buyback Program was $1.3 billion. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following sections discuss the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies: 82 Table of Contents Valuation of Assets and Liabilities Acquired in a Business Combination For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of certain acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. When appropriate, we engage third-party valuation specialists to assist in the fair value determination of acquired tangible and intangible assets. The purchase price allocation recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available. In February 2022, we acquired all of the member interests in Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC for $3.2 billion in net cash consideration. For information regarding this business combination, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Depreciation expense incorporates management estimates regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets into service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected salvage values or (iv) significant changes in our forecast of the remaining life for the associated resource basins, if applicable. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $44.4 billion and $42.1 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion of depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets, which consist of intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand for or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals or refined products. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated residual values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset’s estimated future discounted cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include the usage of probabilities when there is a range of possible outcomes. 83 Table of Contents We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate there is a potential loss in value of the investment attributable to an other-than-temporary decline. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances include continuing operating losses of the entity and/or long-term negative changes in the entity’s industry. In the event we determine that the value of an investment is not recoverable due to an other-than-temporary decline, we record a non-cash impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful lives of the investment’s underlying assets. A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any write-down of the carrying values of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. In 2022 and 2021, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges attributable to assets other than goodwill totaling $53 million and $233 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For information regarding impairment charges involving property, plant and equipment see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. We did not recognize any impairment charges in connection with our equity-method investments during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Amortization Methods of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to commercial relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. In certain instances, the acquisition of these intangible assets provides us with access to customers in a defined resource basin and is analogous to having a franchise in a particular area. Efficient operation of the acquired assets (e.g., a natural gas gathering system) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing producers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones within our existing asset footprint. The duration of this type of customer relationship is limited by the estimated economic life of the associated resource basin that supports the customer group. When estimating the economic life of a resource basin, we consider a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. In other situations, the acquisition of a customer relationship intangible asset provides us with access to customers whose hydrocarbon volumes are not attributable to specific resource basins. As with basin-specific customer relationships, efficient operation of the associated assets (e.g., a marine terminal that handles volumes originating from multiple sources) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing customers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones. The duration of this type of customer relationship is typically limited to the term of the underlying service contracts, including assumed renewals. The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the estimated economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization period for a basin-specific customer relationship asset is limited by the estimated finite economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basin. Contract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the contract is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a marine terminal, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements. 84 Table of Contents If our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was $4.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. We recorded $177 million and $151 million of amortization expense attributable to intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets Our goodwill balance was $5.6 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Goodwill, which represents the cost of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of its net assets at the acquisition date, is subject to annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment charges represent the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value (including its respective goodwill) exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using accepted valuation techniques, primarily through the use of discounted cash flows (i.e., an income approach to fair value) supplemented by market-based assessments, if available. The estimated fair values of our reporting units incorporate assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the assets and operations that comprise each reporting unit including: (i) discrete financial forecasts for the assets comprising the reporting unit, which, in turn, rely on management’s estimates of long-term operating margins, throughput volumes, capital investments and similar factors; (ii) long-term growth rates for the reporting unit’s cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. The fair value estimates are based on Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy. We believe that the assumptions we use in estimating reporting unit fair values are consistent with those that market participants would use in their fair value estimation process. However, due to uncertainties in the estimation process and volatility in the supply and demand for hydrocarbons and similar risk factors, actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2022. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment test at December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value (i.e., by at least 10%). For information regarding our goodwill, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses As noted previously, preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect amounts presented in the financial statements. Due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions, we routinely employ estimates in connection with revenue and expense amounts in order to meet our accelerated financial reporting deadlines. Our most significant routine estimates involve revenues and costs of certain natural gas processing facilities, pipeline transportation revenues, fractionation revenues, marketing revenues and related purchases, and power and utility costs. These types of transactions must be estimated since the actual amounts are generally unavailable at the time we complete our accounting close process. The estimates subsequently reverse in the next accounting period when the corresponding actual customer billing or vendor-invoiced amounts are recorded. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates, which could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Prior to issuing our financial statements, we review our revenue and expense estimates based on currently available information to determine if adjustments are required. 85 Table of Contents Other Matters Parent-Subsidiary Guarantor Relationship The Partnership (the “Parent Guarantor”) has guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on the consolidated debt obligations of EPO (the “Subsidiary Issuer”), with the exception of the remaining debt obligations of TEPPCO Partners, L.P. (collectively, the “Guaranteed Debt”). If EPO were to default on any of its Guaranteed Debt, the Partnership would be responsible for full and unconditional repayment of such obligations. At December 31, 2022, the total amount of Guaranteed Debt was $29.0 billion, which was comprised of $25.8 billion of EPO’s senior notes, $2.3 billion of EPO’s junior subordinated notes, $495 million of short-term commercial paper notes and $426 million of related accrued interest. The Partnership’s guarantees of EPO’s senior note obligations, commercial paper notes and borrowings under bank credit facilities represent unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Partnership that rank equal in right of payment to all other existing or future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Partnership. In addition, these guarantees effectively rank junior in right of payment to any existing or future indebtedness of the Partnership that is secured and unsubordinated, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Partnership’s guarantees of EPO’s junior subordinated notes represent unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Partnership that rank equal in right of payment to all other existing or future subordinated indebtedness of the Partnership and senior in right of payment to all existing or future equity securities of the Partnership. The Partnership’s guarantees of EPO’s junior subordinated notes effectively rank junior in right of payment to (i) any existing or future indebtedness of the Partnership that is secured, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness and (ii) all other existing or future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Partnership. The Partnership may be released from its guarantee obligations only in connection with EPO’s exercise of its legal or covenant defeasance options as described in the underlying agreements. Selected Financial Information of Obligor Group The following tables present summarized financial information of the Partnership (as Parent Guarantor) and EPO (as Subsidiary Issuer) on a combined basis (collectively, the “Obligor Group”), after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions among the Obligor Group. In accordance with Rule 13.01 of Regulation S-X, the summarized financial information of the Obligor Group excludes the Obligor Group’s equity in income and investments in the consolidated subsidiaries of EPO that are not party to the guarantee obligations (the “Non-Obligor Subsidiaries”). The total carrying value of the Obligor Group’s investments in the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries was $47.5 billion at December 31, 2022. The Obligor Group’s equity in the earnings of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $5.9 billion. Although the net assets and earnings of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries are not directly available to the holders of the Guaranteed Debt to satisfy the repayment of such obligations, there are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries to pay distributions or make loans to EPO or the Partnership. EPO exercises control over the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries. We continue to believe that the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership presented under Item 8 of this annual report provide a more appropriate view of our credit standing. Our investment grade credit ratings are based on the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements and not the Obligor Group’s financial information presented below. 86 Table of Contents The following table presents summarized balance sheet information for the combined Obligor Group at December 31, 2022 (dollars in millions): Selected asset information: Current receivables from Non-Obligor Subsidiaries $ 1,012 Other current assets 4,949 Long-term receivables from Non-Obligor Subsidiaries 187 Other noncurrent assets, excluding investments in Non-Obligor Subsidiaries of $47.5 billion 9,130 Selected liability information: Current portion of Guaranteed Debt, including interest of $426 million $ 2,171 Current payables to Non-Obligor Subsidiaries 1,899 Other current liabilities 4,121 Noncurrent portion of Guaranteed Debt, principal only 26,807 Noncurrent payables to Non-Obligor Subsidiaries 38 Other noncurrent liabilities 98 Mezzanine equity of Obligor Group: Preferred units $ 49 The following table presents summarized income statement information for the combined Obligor Group for the year ended December 31, 2022 (dollars in millions): Revenues from Non-Obligor Subsidiaries $ 14,145 Revenues from other sources 27,312 Operating income of Obligor Group 836 Net loss of Obligor Group, excluding equity in earnings of Non-Obligor Subsidiaries of $5.9 billion (450 ) Related Party Transactions For information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report as well as Part III, Item 13 of this annual report. Income Taxes On September 29, 2021, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a Notice of Selection for Examination to EPO, stating that the IRS has selected its 2019 and 2020 partnership tax returns for examination. On January 6, 2022, the IRS issued a Notice of Selection for Examination to the Partnership stating that the IRS has selected our 2019 and 2020 partnership tax returns for examination. These are routine compliance examinations of various items of income, gain, deductions, losses and credits of EPO and the Partnership, respectively, during the years under examination. Insurance For information regarding insurance matters, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 87 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. General In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding. The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming: • the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk; • the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and • the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period. We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. Accordingly, the nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. Commodity Hedging Activities The price of energy commodities such as natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps and basis swaps. At December 31, 2022, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory and (iii) hedging natural gas processing margins. For a summary of our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 88 Table of Contents Sensitivity Analysis The following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair values of our principal commodity derivative instrument portfolios at the dates indicated (dollars in millions). The fair value information presented in the sensitivity analysis tables excludes the impact of applying Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) Rule 814, which deems that financial instruments cleared by the CME are settled daily in connection with variation margin payments. As a result of this exchange rule, CME-related derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and subject to future commodity price fluctuations until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms. Derivative transactions cleared on exchanges other than the CME (e.g., the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE) continue to be reported on a gross basis.

This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. As of the filing date of this annual report, we do not have any interest rate hedging derivative instruments outstanding.",2023-12-30 21:15:59.226657

Overview of Business We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.” We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. Our midstream energy operations include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and import and export terminals (including liquefied petroleum gas or “LPG”); crude oil gathering, transportation, storage and terminals; offshore production platforms; petrochemical and refined products transportation and services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems and in the Gulf of Mexico. Our assets include approximately 51,000 miles of onshore and offshore pipelines; 200 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, petrochemicals, refined products and crude oil; and 14 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity. In addition, our asset portfolio includes 24 natural gas processing plants, 22 NGL and propylene fractionators, six offshore hub platforms located in the Gulf of Mexico, a butane isomerization complex, NGL import and LPG export terminals, and octane enhancement and high-purity isobutylene production facilities. We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement or by other service providers. We have five reportable business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services; (ii) Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services; (iii) Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services; (iv) Offshore Pipelines & Services; and (v) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. For information regarding our business segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Significant Recent Developments Front Range Pipeline Begins Operations Our Front Range Pipeline commenced operations in February 2014. This 435-mile pipeline transports NGLs originating from the Denver-Julesburg production basin in Weld County, Colorado to Skellytown, Texas in Carson County. With connections to our Mid-America Pipeline System and Texas Express Pipeline, the Front Range Pipeline provides producers in the Denver-Julesburg basin with access to the Gulf Coast, which is the largest NGL market in the U.S. Initial throughput capacity for the Front Range Pipeline is 150 MBPD, which could be expanded to approximately 230 MBPD with certain system modifications. The Front Range Pipeline is owned by Front Range Pipeline LLC, which is a joint venture among us and affiliates of DCP Midstream Partners LP (“DCP”) and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (“Anadarko”). We operate the Front Range Pipeline and own a one-third member interest in Front Range Pipeline LLC. 67 Table of Contents Appalachia-to-Texas Express (“ATEX Express”) Pipeline Begins Operations Our ATEX Express pipeline commenced operations in January 2014. The ATEX Pipeline transports ethane in southbound service from NGL fractionation plants located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to our Mont Belvieu storage complex. The ethane extracted by these fractionation facilities originates from the Marcellus and Utica Shale production areas. In addition to newly constructed pipeline segments, significant portions of the ATEX Express pipeline consist of segments that were formerly used in refined products transportation service by our TE Products Pipeline. Initial throughput capacity for the ATEX Express pipeline is 125 MBPD, which could be expanded to approximately 265 MBPD with certain system modifications. ATEX Express terminates at our Mont Belvieu storage complex, which includes approximately 110 MMBbls of NGL and petroleum liquid storage capacity and an extensive pipeline distribution system. With the addition of our Aegis Pipeline (currently under construction), we will link Marcellus and Utica Shale-produced ethane to existing ethylene production facilities along the U.S. Gulf Coast and provide supply security to support construction of new third-party ethylene plants currently planned at Texas and Louisiana petrochemical facilities. Also, since our distribution system supports our LPG export terminal on the Houston Ship Channel, ethane volumes delivered to Mont Belvieu via ATEX may enhance the prospects for U.S.-produced ethane being exported to international markets. Expansion of Houston Ship Channel LPG Export Terminal We provide customers with LPG export services at our marine terminal located on the Houston Ship Channel. This terminal has the capability to load cargoes of fully refrigerated, low-ethane propane and/or butane onto multiple tanker vessels simultaneously. In March 2013, we completed an expansion project at this terminal that increased its loading capability from 4.0 MMBbls per month to 7.5 MMBbls per month. Our LPG export services continue to benefit from increased NGL supplies produced from domestic shale plays such as the Eagle Ford Shale and strong international demand for propane as a feedstock in ethylene plant operations and for power generation and heating purposes. In September 2013, we announced an expansion project at this LPG export terminal that is expected to increase its ability to load cargoes from 7.5 MMBbls per month to approximately 9.0 MMBbls per month. This expansion project is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015. In January 2014, we announced a further expansion of this LPG export terminal that is expected to increase its ability to load cargoes from approximately 9.0 MMBbls per month to in excess of 16.0 MMBbls per month. Once this expansion project is completed, we expect our maximum loading capacity at this export terminal will be approximately 27,000 barrels per hour. This expansion project is supported by a 50-year service agreement with Oiltanking Partners, L.P. (“Oiltanking”), which has agreed to provide additional dock space and related services to us at the terminal site. The expanded LPG export terminal is expected to be in service by the end of 2015 and is supported by long-term LPG export agreements. Mid-America Pipeline System’s Rocky Mountain Expansion Project Begins Operations In January 2014, we announced the completion of an expansion project involving the Rocky Mountain pipeline of our Mid-America Pipeline System. This expansion project involved looping 265 miles of the Rocky Mountain pipeline, as well as related pump station modifications, which increased transportation capacity on the pipeline from approximately 275 MBPD to 350 MBPD (after taking into account shipper commitments to the expansion project). This expansion project was built to accommodate growing natural gas and NGL production from major supply basins in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. Start-Up of Eighth NGL Fractionator at Our Mont Belvieu Complex In November 2013, we announced that the eighth NGL fractionator at our Mont Belvieu complex was placed in service. This new unit, which has the capacity to fractionate up to 85 MBPD of NGLs, increases total NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex to approximately 670 MBPD. This fractionator, along with a seventh unit placed into service in September 2013, was built to handle increasing NGL production from 68 Table of Contents domestic shale plays, including the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and other supply basins in the Rocky Mountains and Mid-Continent regions. Our seventh and eighth NGL fractionators are owned by a joint venture, formed in June 2013, between us and Western Gas Partners, LP (“Western Gas”), which is an affiliate of Anadarko. We own 75% of the joint venture’s member interests, with Western Gas owning a 25% noncontrolling interest in the joint venture. Texas Express Pipeline and Related Gathering Systems Begin Operations Our Texas Express Pipeline and two related NGL gathering systems commenced operations in November 2013. The Texas Express Pipeline originates in Skellytown, Texas and extends approximately 580 miles to Mont Belvieu, Texas. The Texas Express Pipeline gives producers in West and Central Texas, the Rocky Mountains, southern Oklahoma, the Mid-Continent and the Denver-Julesburg supply basin much needed takeaway capacity for growing NGL production volumes and improved access to Mont Belvieu, which is the primary industry hub for domestic NGL production. The Texas Express Pipeline is owned by Texas Express Pipeline LLC, which is a joint venture among us and affiliates of Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (“Enbridge”), Anadarko and DCP. We operate the Texas Express Pipeline and own a 35% member interest in Texas Express Pipeline LLC. Mixed NGL volumes from the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin and Mid-Continent regions are transported to the Texas Express Pipeline using our Mid-America Pipeline System. NGL volumes from the Denver-Julesburg supply basin are transported to the Texas Express Pipeline using the Front Range Pipeline. Initial throughput capacity for the Texas Express Pipeline is 280 MBPD, which could be expanded to approximately 400 MBPD with certain system modifications. In addition to the start of operations on the Texas Express Pipeline, service also commenced on two mixed NGL gathering systems developed by Texas Express Gathering LLC, which is a second joint venture among Enbridge, Anadarko and us. We own a 45% member interest in Texas Express Gathering LLC. Enbridge serves as operator of the two gathering systems, which link natural gas processing plants in the Anadarko/Granite Wash and Central Texas/Barnett Shale production areas to the Texas Express Pipeline. Expansion of Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System In September 2013, we, along with Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (“Plains”), announced an expansion of our Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System in South Texas. The expansion is expected to increase the pipeline system’s capacity to transport light and medium grades of crude oil from 300 MBPD to 470 MBPD in order to accommodate expected volumes from Plains’ Cactus pipeline. As currently planned, the expansion of our Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System would be completed in stages that include adding pumping capacity and looping certain segments of the existing system. The expansion also includes constructing an additional 2.3 MMBbls of operational storage capacity at Gardendale, Tilden and Corpus Christi, Texas. We expect the expansion to be completed during the second quarter of 2015. Plans to Develop Refined Products Export Facilities on Texas Gulf Coast In May 2013, we announced the development of a refined products export facility in Beaumont, Texas to meet growing demand for additional refined products export capability on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Export service at this marine terminal is expected to begin during the first quarter of 2014 and would accommodate Panamax class vessels. Panamax class vessels are medium-sized tanker ships designed to transit the existing lock chambers of the Panama Canal. This new export facility will complement our existing refined products pipelines, storage and terminal facilities in southeast Texas and enable us to provide customers with improved access to international markets. In addition to the planned Beaumont export facility, we are evaluating the potential for a second refined products export facility on the Houston Ship Channel. 69 Table of Contents Plans to Expand Crude Oil Storage and Distribution Infrastructure Serving Southeast Texas Historically, southeast Texas refineries have been supplied primarily by waterborne imports of crude oil. With the increase in North American production, crude oil from the Eagle Ford, Permian, Mid-Continent, Bakken and Canada are flowing into Southeast Texas and displacing waterborne crude oil imports. Due to growing domestic production, we expect a significant increase in North American crude oil deliveries to the Gulf Coast market, which currently lacks sufficient storage capacity and has an inadequate distribution system for handling these varying grades of domestic crude oil. In response, we announced plans in May 2013 to significantly expand our crude oil storage and distribution infrastructure serving the southeast Texas refinery market. This planned expansion involves the construction of approximately 4.4 MMBbls of combined new crude oil storage capacity at our Enterprise Crude Houston (“ECHO”) storage facility that will increase this facility’s capacity to approximately 6.5 MMBbls. Also, we plan to construct 55 miles of associated pipelines to directly connect the ECHO storage facility with several major refineries in the Southeast Texas market. The expansion would be completed in phases with final completion expected in the second quarter of 2015. Upon completion of these projects, we will be able to provide southeast Texas refiners with an integrated system featuring supply diversification, significant storage capabilities and a high capacity pipeline distribution system that will be directly connected to refineries having an aggregate capacity of approximately 3.6 MMBPD. In addition, the ECHO storage facility will have access to our marine NGL and crude oil terminal at Morgan’s Point on the Houston Ship Channel. Plans to Build Gulf Coast Ethane Pipeline In March 2013, we announced the receipt of transportation commitments to support development of our 270-mile Aegis Ethane Pipeline, which will deliver ethane to petrochemical plants in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. The Aegis Ethane Pipeline will originate at our Mont Belvieu, Texas storage complex and have the capacity to transport up to 425 MBPD of purity ethane volumes to various petrochemical customers along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. The Aegis Ethane Pipeline is expected to commence operations in stages, with initial sections starting service in the third quarter of 2014 and the remaining sections at different times through the second quarter of 2015. General Outlook for 2014 Commercial Outlook We provide midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Factors that can affect the demand for our products and services include domestic and international economic conditions, the market price and demand for energy, the cost to develop natural gas and crude oil reserves in the U.S., state and federal regulation, and the cost and availability of capital to energy companies to invest in upstream exploration and production activities. As a result of significant advances in non-conventional drilling and production technology, North American reserves and production of hydrocarbons from shale developments have increased substantially. The rapid increase in U.S. hydrocarbon supplies has led to a reduction in imports of crude oil, NGLs, refined products and natural gas. Conversely, this same trend has resulted in significant increases in hydrocarbon exports, particularly of refined products and propane, and contributed to volatility in the price of natural gas and ethane. In general, a lack of infrastructure to export natural gas and ethane has contributed to an oversupply of these energy commodities in recent years. With respect to natural gas, it has been trading at a significant discount to crude oil due to changes in supply and demand fundamentals. For example, on an energy equivalent basis, natural gas prices for 2014 are forecast to be approximately 25% to 30% of the price of crude oil (based on prices quoted in futures markets in January 2014). For 2013 and 2012, natural gas was priced at 22% and 18% of crude oil on an energy equivalent 70 Table of Contents basis, respectively. In addition, ethane prices have decreased over time in terms of price per gallon and as a percentage relative to the price of crude oil on an energy equivalent basis. The decline in ethane prices is attributable to excess domestic inventories of this commodity. For example, the average price of ethane in 2011 was $0.77 per gallon (or 16% of the relative price of crude oil on an energy equivalent basis). The average price of ethane continued to decline in 2012, decreasing to $0.40 per gallon (or 9% of the relative price of crude oil ) and further to $0.26 per gallon (or 5% of the relative price of crude oil) in 2013. As a result of these price trends, producers continue to decrease their drilling activity in onshore areas where natural gas production is considered “dry” or “lean” (i.e., the amount of NGLs produced in connection with the natural gas production is relatively small) and focus more on NGL-rich natural gas and crude oil developments. A similar trend is also occurring in the Gulf of Mexico, with producers investing capital to develop new sources of crude oil production rather than areas where natural gas production is prevalent. In conjunction with these price trends, in recent years natural gas and NGLs have developed a significant feedstock price advantage over more costly crude oil derivatives (such as naphtha), and this trend is expected to continue based on prices quoted on the futures markets in January 2014. This trend is supported by several factors including: (i) technological breakthroughs in drilling techniques used by exploration and production companies in connection with domestic shale resource plays, which have significantly increased U.S. crude oil, natural gas and NGL resources and lowered associated finding and development costs; (ii) the growing demand for crude oil by China, India and other developing economies; (iii) geopolitical risks in many areas of the world that are major exporters of crude oil such as the Middle East; and (iv) the general inability to export natural gas from the U.S. resulting in an oversupply of and lower market values for natural gas. New natural gas export facilities face various hurdles to their construction, including significant capital requirements, long construction timeframes, and permitting and regulatory issues. As a result of the feedstock price advantage currently held by natural gas and NGLs, energy consumers in the industrial manufacturing and power generation sectors are continuing to adjust their feedstock and asset portfolios to consume increasing amounts of natural gas and NGLs in their operations. In addition, we believe the feedstock price advantage of domestically-produced NGLs has led to a long-term fundamental change in feedstock selection by the U.S. petrochemical industry, which is the largest consumer of domestic NGLs. Since NGLs typically trade at a significant discount to crude oil, using NGLs as a feedstock provides a substantial cost advantage for U.S. petrochemical companies when compared to naphtha, whose price is closely linked to international crude prices. From 2009 through 2013, ethane and propane have consistently been the most profitable feedstocks in the production of ethylene. In order to capitalize on this cost advantage, U.S. petrochemical companies have maximized their consumption of domestic NGLs, particularly ethane, in the production of ethylene. Many of these companies have announced plans to invest billions of dollars to construct NGL feedstock-oriented, world-scale ethylene plants on the Gulf Coast. For example, CP Chemical announced in December 2011 that it expects to build a 1.5 million metric tons per year ethylene plant in Cedar Bayou, Texas by 2017. Likewise, Formosa Plastics announced in March 2012 that it expects to build an 800 thousand metric tons per year ethylene plant along the U.S. Gulf Coast by 2016/2017. Also, Dow Chemical announced in April 2012 that it expects to build a 1.5 million metric tons per year ethylene plant along the U.S. Gulf Coast by 2017. Almost all of these new plants and the ethylene industry’s major expansions are in close proximity to our existing or planned assets. Based on industry publications, domestic production of ethylene in 2013 was estimated to be 147 million pounds per day compared to 144 million pounds per day in 2012. Ethane is the most widely used feedstock by the U.S. petrochemical industry in the production of ethylene. As a result, ethane consumption by domestic petrochemical companies has, at times, been in excess of 1.0 million BPD. We believe the U.S. ethylene industry could consume approximately 250 MBPD of additional ethane feedstocks over the next three years through modifications, debottlenecking and expansions at existing facilities. In addition, we believe that announced new petrochemical plant construction projects, including those noted in the preceding paragraph, could consume between 600 MBPD and 750 MBPD of additional ethane feedstocks when completed. However, in the near term and in the absence of such major plant construction and expansion projects being completed, we expect that ethane production will increase more rapidly than the ethylene industry’s current capability to consume the increase in supplies (resulting in an oversupply of ethane). The current ethane oversupply situation may result in volatile ethane prices and prolonged periods of ethane rejection by producers and natural gas processors in an effort to balance supply and 71 Table of Contents demand. This could lower the value of our equity NGL production and reduce the volumes that would otherwise be handled by our NGL fractionators and pipelines. U.S. LPG exports (propane and butane) continue to increase as a result of ample supplies and competitive prices. Overall, U.S. propane waterborne exports increased from approximately 153 MBPD in 2012 to 288 MBPD in 2013. Markets in Central and South America have been the major source of new demand for U.S. LPG exports; however, volumes are also being transported to Northwest Europe and Far East Asia. LPG exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Central and South America are expected to increase in the future due to ample propane and butane supplies, competitive pricing and lower transport costs to these markets. Similarly, greater volumes of Gulf Coast-sourced LPGs are expected to reach Asian markets after the anticipated Panama Canal expansion is completed (currently forecast between 2015 and 2018). This expansion project is expected to make LPG exports from the Gulf Coast to Asia more economical for shippers. In 2013, U.S. ethane exports were generally limited to petrochemical customers in Canada that could receive volumes by pipeline; however, as a result of the continuing abundant supply situation for ethane and its cost advantage relative to other feedstocks, we continue to receive interest from petrochemical companies outside of North America regarding potential long-term ethane export arrangements using marine facilities on the Gulf Coast. Drilling activity forecast for 2014 is expected to remain robust in shale plays containing crude oil, condensate and NGL-rich natural gas production such as the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara, Mississippian, Wolfcamp, Woodford, Marcellus and Utica shales. In the Eagle Ford Shale, which runs parallel to the Texas Gulf Coast, we have completed several expansion projects that enable us to gather, transport and process in excess of 1.0 Bcf/d of new NGL-rich natural gas production and to transport substantial volumes of crude oil and condensate to market. In general, energy companies are continuing to have significant success in the Eagle Ford and have accelerated their associated drilling programs. Production from this region includes crude oil, condensate, NGL-rich natural gas and dry natural gas. Since 2010, we have announced major expansions of our natural gas pipeline, storage and processing facilities; NGL pipeline and fractionation facilities; and crude oil pipeline and storage facilities to accommodate the production growth from this region. In the aggregate, these projects account for approximately $4.0 billion of our capital expenditures from 2010 through 2013. Drilling activity in shale plays with predominantly dry natural gas reserves or natural gas reserves with a lower NGL content (e.g., the Haynesville/Bossier, Barnett, Fayetteville, Piceance and Jonah/Pinedale shales) are expected to remain well below peak levels. As a result, we expect that natural gas volumes on pipelines that serve these supply basins, including our Jonah, Piceance Basin, San Juan and Haynesville gathering systems, may decline further in 2014 when compared to 2013. Although these supply basins are currently experiencing production declines, we believe that these areas have substantial, undeveloped natural gas reserves with some of the lowest exploration and production costs in the U.S. Furthermore, we believe that as U.S. demand for natural gas and ethane becomes more balanced and, as a result, natural gas and ethane prices stabilize and increase, these supply basins could experience an increase in drilling activity to support, and potentially increase, their future production levels. With respect to the Gulf of Mexico, producers continue to increase drilling activity following federal regulatory uncertainty in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon (or Macondo) incident. We expect that transportation volumes on our offshore crude oil pipelines will continue to increase as significant deepwater prospects begin production. For example, we expect that our Southeast Keathley Canyon Pipeline (the “SEKCO pipeline”) will commence operations during the third quarter of 2014. The 149-mile SEKCO crude oil gathering pipeline, which is expected to have a capacity of 115 MBPD, will serve the new Lucius crude oil and natural gas field located in the southern Keathley Canyon area of the deepwater central Gulf of Mexico. Conversely, we expect that throughput volumes on our offshore Gulf of Mexico natural gas pipelines will continue to decline in 2014 due to producers focusing more of their near-term resources to exploit offshore crude oil developments and onshore NGL-rich natural gas and crude oil producing areas. However, we believe that as U.S. natural gas supply and demand becomes more balanced and, as a result, natural gas prices stabilize and increase, natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico could experience an increase in drilling activity. Our TE Products Pipeline and related Centennial Pipeline are designed to transport refined products from refineries on the Gulf Coast to markets in the Midwest and Northeast U.S. As a result of increased refinery production in the Midwest and lower demand for refined products in these markets, demand to transport refined 72 Table of Contents products from the Gulf Coast has decreased. In order to efficiently utilize our refined products pipelines, management is pursuing projects that convert portions of these pipelines and related infrastructure to alternate uses. For example, certain segments of our TE Products Pipeline were repurposed to accommodate the southbound transportation of ethane from the Marcellus and Utica Shales by our ATEX Express pipeline, which commenced operations in January 2014. Another example would be the conversion of our Gulf Coast refined products import facility into a refined products export dock. We anticipate that the first phase of our refined products export dock will be placed into service during the second quarter of 2014. As a result of our crude oil pipeline infrastructure improvements, we have greater access to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners. Historically, these refining customers have purchased crude oil based on Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) prices, which averaged $107.34 per barrel for 2013 compared to $111.72 per barrel for 2012. Whereas WTI prices have generally been reflective of the economics of the Mid-Continent crude oil market, LLS prices are reflective of market economics along the Gulf Coast for light sweet grades of crude oil, whether foreign or domestic, although certain Gulf Coast markets such as Houston trade at a discount to LLS. Price differentials between West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) and Brent crude oil narrowed appreciably in 2013 compared to 2012, with the spread averaging $10.79 per barrel in 2013 compared to $17.50 per barrel in 2012. Furthermore, with additional pipeline capacity between the Mid-Continent and the Gulf Coast being placed into service, along with growing pipeline capacity to redirect Permian Basin crude oil production directly to the Gulf Coast, the price differential between WTI and LLS crude oil also narrowed appreciably to average $9.37 per barrel in 2013 compared to $17.52 per barrel in 2012. Similarly, with growth in the ability to route crude oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast, the LLS to Brent differential fell appreciably in 2013, dropping from an average of a positive $1.28 per barrel in the first half 2013 to a negative $4.12 per barrel in the second half of 2013. Cheaper LLS prices compared to Brent encourage domestic crude oil barrels to move from the Mid-Continent to the Gulf Coast and discourage crude oil imports; and refiners in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast benefit from more attractive domestic crude prices compared to higher priced waterborne crudes like Brent. As a result, many domestic refineries are modifying and expanding their facilities in order to process more North American crude oil and are also increasing their refined product exports in order to capture market share in emerging economies, which typically have insufficient refining capacity to satisfy their growing demand. We expect North American crude oil supplies to continue to displace imported crude oil volumes, particularly light, sweet grades, in 2014 and we expect the U.S. refining industry to continue to capitalize on the growing availability of competitively priced, domestic crudes, including increasing their exports of refined products. In conclusion, we expect that natural gas production from NGL-rich shale and other non-conventional developments will, despite periods of ethane rejection, support the utilization of our NGL pipeline, storage and fractionation assets and certain of our natural gas pipelines and processing plants in 2014. We also expect that our distribution pipelines, export facilities and marketing activities will benefit in 2014 due to increased demand for purity NGL products and exports of LPGs and refined products. With approximately $5.5 billion of major organic growth projects currently under construction, we believe we are well positioned for future growth through 2015. Our partnership’s large geographic asset footprint, including significant access to growing energy intensive industries, especially along the Gulf Coast, and growing demand for exports continues to provide us with significant growth opportunities on both the supply and demand side of the value chain. Liquidity Outlook At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $4.1 billion of consolidated liquidity, which is defined as unrestricted cash on hand plus borrowing capacity available under our aggregate $4.5 billion of bank credit facilities. Throughout 2013, the corporate debt and equity capital markets were accessible to us, along with adequate credit availability from banks. Based on current market conditions, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital requirements in 2014. Affiliates of privately held EPCO purchased $100.0 million of our common units during 2013 through our distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”). These same EPCO affiliates have expressed a willingness to purchase up to $100 million of our common units again in 2014 through our DRIP. Their first $25.0 million reinvestment was made in February 2014 and resulted in the issuance of 403,315 of our common units. 73 Table of Contents In January 2014, $500.0 million in principal amount of Senior Notes O matured and were repaid using the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program. In February 2014, EPO issued $850 million in principal amount of 3.90% senior notes due February 2024 (“Senior Notes JJ”) and $1.15 billion in principal amount of 5.10% senior notes due February 2045 (“Senior Notes KK”). Net proceeds of $1.98 billion from the issuance of Senior Notes JJ and KK were used to repay debt, including amounts then outstanding under EPO’s $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and EPO’s commercial paper program (which we used to repay $500.0 million in principal amount of Senior Notes O that matured in January 2014) and for general company purposes. As of March 3, 2014, we had approximately $2.7 billion of senior notes maturing in the October 2014 through December 2016 timeframe. The U.S. government is expected to continue to run substantial annual budget deficits from 2014 through 2016 that will require a corresponding issuance of debt by the U.S. Treasury. The interest rate on U.S. Treasury debt has a direct impact on the cost of our debt. At this time, we are uncertain what impact the expected large issuances of U.S. Treasury debt and the prevailing economic and capital market conditions during these future periods will have on the cost and availability of capital, and we have not executed any interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our expected future debt issuances in connection with the refinancing of debt. We continue to monitor and evaluate the condition of the capital markets and our interest rate risk with respect to refinancing these maturities and funding our capital spending program. Total capital spending for 2013 was $4.5 billion, which included $292 million of sustaining capital expenditures. Our most significant growth capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2013 involved projects in the Eagle Ford Shale, at our Mont Belvieu complex, to expand joint venture crude oil pipelines and for the ATEX Express pipeline. We currently expect total capital spending for 2014 to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.4 billion, which includes $350 million for sustaining capital expenditures.

(4) Crude oil prices are based on commercial index prices for WTI as measured on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) and for LLS as reported by Platts. Period-to-period fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices. Energy commodity prices fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including supply and demand imbalances and geopolitical tensions. The following is a discussion of changes in key commodity prices affecting our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2013: § The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs (based on prices for such products at Mont Belvieu, Texas, which is the primary industry hub for domestic NGL production) was $1.02 per gallon for 2013 compared to $1.12 per gallon for 2012 – a 10% year-to-year decrease. Ethane accounts for the largest volume of NGLs extracted from the natural gas stream. The price of ethane averaged $0.26 per gallon during 2013 compared to $0.40 per gallon during 2012. According to U.S. Energy Information Administration statistics, ethane volumes account for approximately 35% of NGLs produced from natural gas processing activities. As a result of producers allocating more of their capital budgets to developing NGL-rich shale plays and their success in extracting such resources, ethane production has increased more rapidly than the ethylene industry’s current capability to consume the increase in supplies. This oversupply situation has contributed to a significant decrease in average ethane prices since the fourth quarter of 2011. § The market price of natural gas (as measured at the Henry Hub in Louisiana) averaged $3.65 per MMBtu for 2013 compared to $2.79 per MMBtu during 2012 – a 31% year-to-year increase. The increase in prices is generally due to higher natural gas demand for power generation and as a heating fuel. § The market price of WTI crude oil (as measured on the NYMEX) averaged $97.97 per barrel for 2013 compared to $94.20 per barrel for 2012. A significant factor in the increase in WTI crude oil prices has been the completion of midstream infrastructure projects, such as the reversal of our Seaway pipeline in 76 Table of Contents mid-2012, which allowed crude oil production formerly stranded at the Cushing hub to reach refining markets along the Gulf Coast. A decrease in our consolidated marketing revenues due to lower energy commodity sales prices may not result in a decrease in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also be lower due to comparable decreases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same correlation would be true in the case of higher energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs. We attempt to mitigate any commodity price exposure through our hedging activities as well as through converting keepwhole and similar contracts to fee-based arrangements. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities. Consolidated Income Statement Highlights The following information highlights significant changes in our comparative income statement amounts and the primary drivers of such changes. Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Revenues for 2013 increased $5.14 billion when compared to 2012. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil increased $2.83 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $2.28 billion increase, and sales prices, which accounted for an additional $543.8 million increase. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs increased a net $1.7 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $3.64 billion increase, partially offset by lower sales prices, which accounted for a $1.94 billion decrease. Revenues from the marketing of natural gas and petrochemical products increased a net $392.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales prices, which accounted for a $1.1 billion increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $708.3 million decrease. Revenues from the marketing of refined products decreased a net $106.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $697.7 million decrease, which was partially offset by the impact of higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $590.9 million increase. Revenues from midstream asset services increased $347.2 million year-to-year primarily due to contributions from recently completed assets that have started operations in the Eagle Ford Shale and at our Mont Belvieu complex. Total operating costs and expenses for 2013 increased $4.87 billion when compared to 2012 primarily due to a $4.75 billion increase in cost of sales. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil increased $2.59 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $2.15 billion increase, and purchase prices, which accounted for an additional $440.1 million increase. Cost of sales associated with the marketing of NGLs increased a net $1.95 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $3.36 billion increase, partially offset by lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $1.41 billion decrease. Cost of sales associated with our marketing of natural gas and petrochemical products increased a net $377.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher purchase prices, which accounted for a $1.02 billion increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $643.4 million decrease. Cost of sales associated with the marketing of refined products decreased a net $105.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $733.9 million decrease, which was partially offset by the impact of higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $628.8 million increase. Other operating costs and expenses increased a net $65.5 million year-to-year, which includes a $188.8 million increase primarily due to the addition of operating costs of newly constructed assets that have recently started operations and higher overall maintenance costs, partially offset by a $123.3 million reduction in operating costs due to the sale of certain trucking and distribution assets in January and April 2013. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses in operating costs and expenses increased $87.2 million for 2013 when compared to 2012 primarily due to recently constructed assets being placed into service. We recorded net gains within operating costs and expenses of $83.4 million attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries in 2013 compared to $17.6 million in 2012. In March 2013, we sold the Stratton Ridge-to-Mont Belvieu segment of the Seminole Pipeline, along with a related storage cavern, and recognized a $52.5 million 77 Table of Contents gain on the sale. We recognized $15.0 million of gains attributable to the receipt of nonrefundable cash insurance proceeds related to our West Storage claims in 2013 compared to $30.0 million of such gains in 2012. These proceeds were attributable to property damage claims we filed in connection with the February 2011 NGL release and fire at the West Storage location of our Mont Belvieu, Texas underground storage facility. The remaining West Storage claims of approximately $95.0 million are anticipated to be collected during the first quarter of 2014. To the extent that additional nonrefundable cash insurance proceeds related to this incident are received, we expect to record gains equal to such proceeds. Operating costs and expenses include $92.6 million and $63.4 million of non-cash asset impairment charges in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our non-cash asset impairment charges for 2013 primarily relate to the abandonment of certain segments of crude oil and natural gas pipelines in Texas, Oklahoma and the Gulf of Mexico, certain refined products terminal assets in Texas, an NGL storage cavern in Arizona and an NGL fractionator and storage complex in Ohio. Our asset impairment charges for 2012 primarily relate to the abandonment of certain segments of crude oil and natural gas pipelines in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. General and administrative costs for 2013 increased $18.0 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to higher employee compensation expenses. Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2013 increased $103.0 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to higher earnings from our investments in crude oil pipeline joint ventures. Interest expense for 2013 increased $30.7 million when compared to 2012. The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Interest charged on debt principal outstanding $ 911.7 $ 879.7 $ 847.9 Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization 3.3 (12.6 ) (22.3 ) Interest cost capitalized in connection with construction projects (1) (133.0 ) (116.8 ) (106.7 ) Other (2) 20.5 21.5 25.2 Interest expense $ 802.5 $ 771.8 $ 744.1 (1) Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) ratably over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate from period-to-period based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital spending levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. (2) Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is the primary driver of interest expense, increased a net $32.0 million for 2013 when compared to 2012 generally due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2013, which accounted for $94.5 million of the increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates in 2013, which accounted for a $62.5 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2013 was $17.14 billion compared to $15.3 billion for 2012. In general, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital spending program. For a discussion of our consolidated debt obligations and capital spending program, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within this Item 7. Other non-operating income for 2012 includes $68.8 million of aggregate gains attributable to the liquidation of our investment in Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (“Energy Transfer Equity”). At January 1, 2012, we owned 29,303,514 common units of Energy Transfer Equity representing 13.1% of its limited partner interests. On January 18, 2012, we sold 22,762,636 of these common units in a private transaction, which generated a gain on the sale of $27.5 million. As a result of the January 18, 2012 transaction, our ownership interest in Energy Transfer Equity was reduced below 3%, and we discontinued using the equity method to account for this investment and began accounting for it as an investment in available-for-sale equity securities. Following the January 18, 2012 transaction, we sold the remaining 6,540,878 Energy Transfer Equity common units through April 27, 2012, which generated gains totaling $41.3 million. All activities included in our former sixth reportable business segment, Other Investments, ceased on January 18, 2012, which was the date we discontinued using the equity method to account for our investment in Energy Transfer Equity. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 78 Table of Contents Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our business segments. Provision for income taxes was $57.5 million in 2013, which primarily reflects our state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (or “Texas Margin Tax”). However, we recognized an overall income tax benefit of $17.2 million for 2012, which was primarily due to a $45.3 million federal income tax benefit related to the conversion of certain of our subsidiaries to limited liability companies during the first quarter of 2012, partially offset by amounts recorded in connection with the Texas Margin Tax. For additional information regarding our provision for income taxes, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Revenues for 2012 decreased $1.73 billion when compared to 2011. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil increased a net $1.58 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $2.19 billion increase, partially offset by lower sales prices, which accounted for a $609.0 million decrease. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs and natural gas decreased a net $2.98 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $4.0 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $1.02 billion increase. Revenues from the marketing of petrochemical products decreased $701.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $461.5 million decrease, and lower sales prices, which accounted for an additional $239.7 million decrease. Revenues from the marketing of refined products increased a net $78.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $95.1 million increase, partially offset by lower sales prices, which accounted for a $16.8 million decrease. Revenues from midstream asset services increased $197.7 million year-to-year primarily due to contributions from our newly constructed assets in the Eagle Ford Shale and our Acadian Haynesville Extension pipeline, which commenced operations in November 2011. Total operating costs and expenses for 2012 decreased $1.95 billion when compared to 2011 primarily due to a $2.28 billion decrease in cost of sales. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil increased a net $1.36 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $2.07 billion increase, partially offset by lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $708.3 million decrease. Cost of sales associated with the marketing of NGLs and natural gas decreased a net $2.94 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $3.8 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for an $866.1 million increase. Cost of sales associated with our marketing of petrochemical products decreased $915.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $479.3 million decrease, and lower purchase prices, which accounted for an additional $436.5 million decrease. Cost of sales associated with our marketing of refined products increased $116.6 million primarily due to higher sales volumes. Other operating costs and expenses increased $49.5 million year-to-year primarily due to the addition of operating costs of newly constructed assets that have recently started operations and higher overall maintenance costs. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses increased $103.0 million for 2012 when compared to 2011 primarily due to recently constructed assets being placed into service. Gains attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries for 2012 decreased $138.4 million when compared to 2011. In December 2011, we sold our ownership interests in a natural gas storage facility located in Mississippi and recorded a $129.1 million gain on the sale. Non-cash asset impairment charges for 2012 increased $35.6 million when compared to 2011 primarily due to the abandonment in 2012 of certain segments of crude oil and natural gas pipelines in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. General and administrative costs for 2012 decreased $11.5 million when compared to 2011. Our results for 2011 included $12.0 million of transaction expenses related to the Duncan Merger. Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2012 increased $17.9 million when compared to 2011 primarily due to improved results from the Seaway Pipeline partially offset by a decrease in equity earnings from Energy Transfer Equity. Equity earnings from our investment in the Seaway Pipeline increased $36.7 million year-to-year due to the completion of its reversal project during the second quarter of 2012. Our equity in the income of 79 Table of Contents Energy Transfer Equity was $2.4 million for 2012 compared to $14.8 million for 2011. We liquidated our remaining investment in Energy Transfer Equity common units in early 2012. Interest expense for 2012 increased $27.7 million when compared to 2011. As presented in the interest expense table under “Comparison of 2013 with 2012” above, interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is the primary driver of interest expense, increased a net $31.8 million for 2012 when compared to 2011 generally due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2012, which accounted for $41.1 million of the increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates in 2012, which accounted for a $9.3 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2012 was $15.3 billion compared to $14.59 billion for 2011. Other non-operating income for 2012 increased $72.9 million when compared to 2011 primarily due to $68.8 million of aggregate gains we recorded in connection with the liquidation of our investment in Energy Transfer Equity, which was completed in April 2012. We recognized an income tax benefit of $17.2 million for 2012 compared to a $27.2 million provision for income taxes in 2011. The $44.4 million year-to-year change in income taxes is primarily due to a $45.3 million federal income tax benefit related to the conversion of certain of our subsidiaries to limited liability companies during the first quarter of 2012. Business Segment Highlights Total segment gross operating margin was $4.82 billion, $4.39 billion and $3.87 billion for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following information highlights significant changes in our year-to-year segment results (i.e., gross operating margin amounts) and the primary drivers of such changes. The selected volume statistics presented in the tabular information for each segment are reported on a net basis, taking into account our ownership interests in certain joint ventures, and reflect the periods in which we owned an interest in such operations. These statistics reflect volumes for newly constructed assets from the dates such assets were placed into service and for purchased assets from the date of acquisition. We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. For information regarding this financial metric, see “Other Items – Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure” within this Part II, Item 7. All activities included in our former sixth reportable business segment, Other Investments, ceased on January 18, 2012, which was the date we discontinued using the equity method to account for our previously held investment in Energy Transfer Equity. Our equity earnings from this investment were $2.4 million and $14.8 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively. 80 Table of Contents NGL Pipelines & Services. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Segment gross operating margin: Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities $ 1,165.4 $ 1,443.0 $ 1,324.4 NGL pipelines and related storage 900.0 740.7 638.4 NGL fractionation 449.0 284.8 221.4 Total $ 2,514.4 $ 2,468.5 $ 2,184.2 Selected volumetric data: NGL transportation volumes (MBPD) 2,787 2,472 2,284 NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD) 726 659 575 Equity NGL production (MBPD) (1) 126 101 116 Fee-based natural gas processing (MMcf/d) (2) 4,612 4,382 3,820 (1) Represents the NGL volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities. In general, equity NGL production decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to reduced ethane recoveries associated with the weakness in natural gas processing margins resulting from lower NGL prices. The increase in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to equity NGL volumes produced at our Yoakum facility in South Texas. (2) Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our gas plants. The increase in fee-based processing volumes in 2013 and 2012 is primarily due to (i) the start-up of our Yoakum gas plant in May 2012 and (ii) changes in processing agreements whereby producers are electing to process more of their natural gas on a fee basis in order to retain NGLs extracted from their natural gas streams, which, in turn, also lowers our equity NGL production. Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2013 decreased $277.6 million when compared to 2012. Gross operating margin from our Meeker natural gas processing plant in Colorado decreased $182.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower processing margins in 2013. In general, natural gas processing margins are lower in 2013 when compared to 2012 due to lower NGL prices and higher natural gas prices in each respective year. Gross operating margin from our Pioneer natural gas processing plant in Wyoming decreased $81.3 million year-to-year primarily due to the effects of ethane rejection and general production declines, both of which lowered equity NGL production volumes at this facility during 2013 when compared to 2012. In general, producers utilizing our Pioneer facility have curtailed their drilling programs in the Jonah and Pinedale production fields in response to continued low market prices for natural gas. Gross operating margin from our South Texas natural gas processing plants increased a net $15.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher volumes, which accounted for a $54.3 million increase, and higher processing fees, which resulted in a $28.6 million increase, partially offset by lower processing margins, which accounted for a $65.3 million decrease. These gas plants continue to benefit from NGL-rich natural gas production from the Eagle Ford Shale and the start-up of our Yoakum gas processing plant. The first phase (or “train”) of our new cryogenic natural gas processing plant at Yoakum, Texas commenced operations in May 2012. We placed the second and third trains at the Yoakum plant in service in August 2012 and March 2013, respectively. Gross operating margin from our remaining natural gas processing plants decreased a combined $40.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower processing margins in 2013. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities for 2013 increased a net $44.3 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $131.0 million increase, partially offset by lower sales margins, which accounted for an $87.0 million decrease. Comparability between 2013 and 2012 gross operating margin amounts was also impacted by a $20.0 million gain related to proceeds received in a vendor settlement and a $13.7 million gain attributable to changes in a provision for certain gas plant capacity obligations, both of which were recorded in 2012. 81 Table of Contents Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2012 increased $118.6 million when compared to 2011. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities for 2012 increased $150.4 million when compared to 2011, of which we attribute $94.2 million of the year-to-year increase to higher sales margins and the remainder to higher sales volumes. Our South Texas natural gas processing plants posted a $57.2 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin primarily due to higher equity NGL and fee-based processing volumes from the start-up of the first and second trains of our Yoakum facility in 2012. Gross operating margin from our Meeker natural gas processing plant increased $34.8 million year-to-year primarily due to the favorable impact of our commodity hedging activities on this facility’s processing margins during 2012. Gross operating margin from our Pioneer and Chaco natural gas processing plants decreased $115.8 million year-to-year primarily due to lower equity NGL production volumes. Gross operating margin from our Louisiana and East Texas natural gas processing plants decreased $32.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower natural gas processing margins. Gross operating margin for 2012 includes a $20.0 million gain related to proceeds received in a vendor settlement and a $13.7 million gain attributable to changes in a provision for certain plant capacity obligations. NGL pipelines and related storage Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from NGL pipelines and related storage assets for 2013 increased $159.3 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to strong results from our South Texas and Houston region NGL assets and the Dixie Pipeline. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System increased $68.1 million year-to-year primarily due to a 126 MBPD increase in transportation volumes associated with Eagle Ford Shale production. Gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel LPG export terminal and related Channel Pipeline increased a combined $50.0 million year-to-year primarily due to increased volumes. As a result of high demand for propane export services, loading volumes at our Houston Ship Channel LPG export terminal increased 99 MBPD year-to-year and volumes transported on the related Channel Pipeline increased 108 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Dixie Pipeline and related NGL terminals increased $18.2 million year-to-year primarily due to a 27 MBPD increase in transportation volumes for 2013, which accounted for $10.7 million of the increase after taking into account associated operating costs, and higher transportation and other fees, which accounted for $7.5 million of the increase. Transportation volumes on the Dixie Pipeline were negatively impacted during 2012 due to downtime associated with pipeline integrity projects and warmer than normal winter weather. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related NGL terminals increased a net $7.2 million year-to-year. A $43.2 million increase in revenues associated with higher system-wide tariffs and other fees, combined with a $4.3 million decrease in operating costs primarily due to pipeline gains during 2013, was partially offset by a $40.3 million decrease in gross operating margin attributable to lower transportation volumes. Transportation volumes for our Mid-America Pipeline System and Seminole Pipeline decreased a combined 75 MBPD year-to-year primarily due to lower NGL production from Rocky Mountain natural gas processing plants caused by ethane rejection and reduced demand for NGL transportation services between Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage business for 2012 increased $102.3 million when compared to 2011. Gross operating margin from our Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole Pipeline and related NGL terminals increased $37.2 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in system-wide tariffs and other fees. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu NGL storage business increased $22.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher storage volumes. Gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel LPG export terminal and related Channel Pipeline increased $22.0 million year-to-year attributable to higher propane export volumes. Gross operating margin from our South Texas NGL Pipeline System, including the Eagle Ford NGL Pipeline placed into service in April 2012, increased $45.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher NGL volumes associated with Eagle Ford Shale production. The foregoing year-to-year increases in gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and related storage business were partially offset by $20.1 million of net operational measurement gains in 2011 that did not reoccur in 2012. 82 Table of Contents NGL fractionation Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2013 increased $164.2 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to higher fractionation fees and volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex. Our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators have benefitted from increased mixed NGL volumes arriving at Mont Belvieu from domestic shale plays such as the Eagle Ford Shale and other producing regions such as the Rocky Mountains. Higher average fractionation and other fees during 2013 attributable to our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionators accounted for a $82.4 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin. Also, NGL fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex increased 97 MBPD year-to-year (net to our ownership interest), which resulted in a $61.1 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin after taking into account associated operating costs. NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex increased by 170 MBPD during 2013 as a result of placing our seventh and eighth NGL fractionation units into service in September and November 2013, respectively. Overall, total NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex was approximately 670 MBPD at the end of 2013. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2012 increased $63.4 million when compared to 2011 primarily due to higher fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex. We placed into service our fifth and sixth NGL fractionation units at our Mont Belvieu complex during the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2012, respectively. Completion of these units increased total NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex by a combined 170 MBPD. Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services.

Gross operating margin from onshore natural gas pipelines and services for 2013 increased $13.5 million when compared to 2012. Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System increased $57.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher firm capacity reservation revenues. Increased natural gas production from the Eagle Ford Shale, in large part a by-product of increased NGL and crude oil production, continues to support strong demand for our natural gas transportation services on the Texas Intrastate System. Natural gas transportation volumes for the Texas Intrastate System increased 206 BBtus/d year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities increased $8.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales margins. Gross operating margin from our Jonah, Piceance Basin and Haynesville Gathering Systems decreased a combined $35.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower gathering volumes. Gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System increased a net $0.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher gathering fees, which are indexed to natural gas prices and accounted for a $16.2 million increase, partially offset by the effects of lower volumes, which accounted for a $15.8 million decrease. Producers served by these four gathering systems have curtailed their drilling programs in response to the continued low price of natural gas. Collectively, natural gas transportation volumes for these four gathering systems decreased 805 BBtus/d year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Acadian Gas System decreased $14.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating expenses, which accounted for $6.3 million of the decrease, and lower sales margins, which accounted for a $5.1 million decrease. Transportation volumes for our Acadian Gas System declined a net 63 BBtus/d year-to-year primarily due to lower volumes from the Haynesville supply basin. Overall, natural gas transportation volumes for 2013 decreased a net 698 BBtus/d when compared to 2012 primarily due to a combined 868 BBtus/d decrease in volumes for 2013 on our Jonah, Piceance Basin, Haynesville, 83 Table of Contents Acadian and San Juan systems partially offset by increased volumes of 206 BBtus/d on our Texas Intrastate System for 2013. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from onshore natural gas pipelines and services for 2012 increased $100.2 million when compared to 2011. Gross operating margin from our Acadian Gas System increased $142.5 million year-to-year primarily due to contributions from our Haynesville Extension pipeline. The Haynesville Extension of our Acadian Gas System commenced operations in November 2011 and transported 1.4 TBtus/d of natural gas during 2012. Gross operating margin from our Texas natural gas pipelines and related storage assets increased $86.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher firm capacity reservation revenues on the Texas Intrastate System. Gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System decreased $31.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower gathering and related fees. Gathering fees on our San Juan system are impacted by changes in regional natural gas prices, which decreased on average 31% year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities decreased $24.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins. Gross operating margin from our Jonah Gathering System decreased $17.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower throughput volumes. Likewise, gross operating margin from our Central Treating Facility in Colorado decreased $9.8 million year-to-year due to lower volumes. Lastly, gross operating margin decreased $38.4 million year-to-year primarily due to the sale of our Mississippi natural gas storage business in December 2011. Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Segment gross operating margin $ 742.7 $ 387.7 $ 234.0 Selected volumetric data: Crude oil transportation volumes (MBPD) 1,175 828 678 Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our onshore crude oil pipelines and services business for 2013 increased $355.0 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to higher volumes on our crude oil pipeline systems and improved results from our crude oil marketing activities. Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System increased $192.3 million year-to-year primarily due to a 107 MBPD increase in volumes on the Eagle Ford Expansion pipeline. Gross operating margin from our investments in the Seaway Pipeline and Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System increased a combined $110.6 million year-to-year primarily due to an aggregate 193 MBPD increase in transportation volumes (net to our interest) on these pipelines. Lastly, gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related activities increased $30.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from our onshore crude oil pipelines and services business for 2012 increased $153.7 million when compared to 2011. Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related activities increased $59.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales margins, which accounted for $35.5 million of the increase, and sales volumes, which accounted for the remaining increase. Our crude oil marketing activities benefitted from increased crude oil production volumes from supply basins in the Eagle Ford Shale, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountains regions. Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System increased $55.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes attributable to the Eagle Ford Expansion pipeline. Equity earnings from our investment in the Seaway Pipeline increased $36.7 million year-to-year primarily due to the Seaway Pipeline commencing the southbound delivery of crude oil in May 2012. 84 Table of Contents Offshore Pipelines & Services. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Offshore Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Segment gross operating margin $ 146.1 $ 173.0 $ 228.2 Selected volumetric data: (1) Natural gas transportation volumes (BBtus/d) 678 853 1,065 Crude oil transportation volumes (MBPD) 307 300 279 Platform natural gas processing (MMcf/d) 202 291 405 Platform crude oil processing (MBPD) 16 17 17 In April 2010, in an event unrelated to our operations, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig caught fire and sank in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in an oil spill. As a result, governmental agencies took actions to halt most drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico for a period of time extending into late 2010. The moratorium impacted the timing of exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico, with such activities only recently reaching pre-moratorium levels. In general, regulations resulting from the Deepwater Horizon incident have made it more difficult for producers to obtain governmental approvals for offshore exploration and production activities. To the extent that new regulations or other governmental actions significantly curtail such exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico, it could have a material adverse effect on our offshore operations. Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our offshore pipelines and services business for 2013 decreased $26.9 million when compared to 2012. In the aggregate, gross operating margin from our Independence Hub platform and Independence Trail pipeline decreased $24.7 million year-to-year primarily due to the expiration of contractual platform demand fees during the first quarter of 2012, which accounted for $9.7 million of the decrease, and lower platform processing and pipeline throughput volumes during 2013, which accounted for $16.0 million of the decrease. Natural gas processing volumes on the Independence Hub platform decreased 88 MMcf/d year-to-year (71 MMcf/d net to our interest) and natural gas transportation volumes on the Independence Trail pipeline decreased 73 BBtus/d year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our High Island Offshore System (“HIOS”) decreased $3.4 million year-to-year primarily due to a 37 BBtus/d decrease in natural gas transportation volumes. Equity earnings from our investment in Neptune Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (“Neptune”) include a $4.8 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in 2013 as a result of declining pipeline throughput volumes forecast for Neptune’s pipeline systems in 2014 and future years. Collectively, gross operating margin from our Shenzi and Constitution Oil Pipelines decreased $7.4 million year-to-year. These pipelines experienced a combined 13 MBPD decrease in throughput volumes primarily due to production declines. Equity earnings from our investment in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline increased $7.8 million year-to-year primarily due to a 22 MBPD increase (net to our interest) in crude oil transportation volumes. Gross operating margin for this segment also benefited from a $6.5 million year-to-year decrease in insurance costs. Due to the high cost of windstorm insurance coverage for our offshore Gulf of Mexico assets, we elected to self-insure these assets during the annual policy period extending from June 2012 to June 2013. We continue to self-insure these assets for the current annual policy period, which extends from June 2013 to June 2014. For a discussion of insurance-related matters, see “Other Items – Insurance Matters” within this Part II, Item 7. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from our offshore pipelines and services business for 2012 decreased $55.2 million when compared to 2011. Collectively, gross operating margin from our Independence Hub platform and Independence Trail pipeline decreased $68.2 million year-to-year primarily due to lower throughput volumes and contractual platform demand fee revenues during 2012 versus 2011. Producers connected to our Independence Hub platform paid us $54.6 million of demand fees annually for five years beginning in March 2007 until that period expired in March 2012. Expiration of these contractual platform demand fees resulted in a $44.9 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin. 85 Table of Contents Collectively, gross operating margin from our Anaconda Natural Gas Gathering System and Constitution and Poseidon Crude Oil Pipelines increased $22.4 million year-to-year primarily due to natural gas and crude oil production from the Caesar/Tonga development in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico that commenced in March 2012. This increase was partially offset by a collective $8.0 million year-to-year decrease in gross operating margin from our Viosca Knoll and HIOS natural gas systems primarily due to lower transportation volumes in 2012. Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Petrochemical & Refined Products Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Segment gross operating margin: Propylene fractionation and related activities $ 134.7 $ 193.1 $ 161.2 Butane isomerization and related operations 99.2 95.8 124.9 Octane enhancement and related plant operations 154.7 100.9 109.1 Refined products pipelines and related activities 164.6 89.9 79.6 Marine transportation and other 72.7 100.2 60.4 Total $ 625.9 $ 579.9 $ 535.2 Selected volumetric data: Propylene fractionation volumes (MBPD) 74 72 73 Butane isomerization volumes (MBPD) 94 95 101 Standalone DIB processing volumes (MBPD) 67 46 28 Octane additive and related plant production volumes (MBPD) 20 16 17 Transportation volumes, primarily refined products and petrochemicals (MBPD) 702 689 783 Propylene fractionation and related activities Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our propylene fractionation and related activities for 2013 decreased $58.4 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to lower propylene sales margins in 2013, which accounted for a $62.7 million decrease, partially offset by higher transportation fees on North Dean Pipeline, which accounted for a $6.2 million increase. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from our propylene fractionation and related activities for 2012 increased $31.9 million when compared to 2011 primarily due to higher propylene sales margins in 2012. Butane isomerization and deisobutanizer operations Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from these operations increased an aggregate $3.4 million for 2013 when compared to 2012. Gross operating margin from our standalone deisobutanizers (“DIBs”), which are used to process mixed butanes from our NGL fractionation operations, increased $7.8 million for 2013 when compared to 2012. We added a new DIB unit at our Mont Belvieu facility in March 2013, which accounted for $5.6 million of gross operating margin for the year and 27 MBPD of additional processing volumes. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization decreased a net $4.5 million in 2013 when compared to 2012 primarily due to increased operating costs, which accounted for an $11.6 million decrease, partially offset by higher by-product sales volumes, which accounted for a $6.6 million increase, and isomerization fees, which accounted for an additional $3.2 million increase. Operating costs for 2013 were higher than in 2012 primarily due to an $8.4 million increase in maintenance costs, which in turn was primarily due to work completed at two of our isomerization units during the fourth quarter of 2013. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from these operations for 2012 decreased a combined $29.1 million when compared to 2011. Gross operating margin from butane isomerization decreased 86 Table of Contents $24.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower isobutane production volumes (and corresponding by-product volumes and sales) and processing fees. High purity isobutane production volumes for 2012 were negatively impacted by extended downtime for maintenance at our octane enhancement facility. The decrease in by-product production and sales during 2012 accounted for $18.6 million of the year-to-year decrease, with $10.5 million of this decrease due to lower sales prices and $8.1 million attributable to lower volumes. Lower isomerization fees accounted for an additional $6.1 million of the year-to-year decrease. Gross operating margin from our standalone DIBs decreased $3.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating costs. Octane enhancement and HPIB plant operations Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement and high purity isobutylene (“HPIB”) plant operations increased a combined $53.8 million for 2013 when compared to 2012. Our octane enhancement facility experienced extended periods of downtime for maintenance during 2012, which negatively impacted the facility’s operating results for that year. The $53.8 million increase in gross operating margin for 2013 is primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $40.0 million increase, and higher sales margins, which accounted for a $29.0 million increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for a $16.8 million decrease. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from octane enhancement and HPIB plant operations for 2012 decreased a combined $8.2 million when compared to 2011. An estimated $27.1 million year-to-year increase in gross operating margin attributable to higher product sales margins was more than offset by the combined effects of a $19.5 million decrease due to lower sales volumes and $15.8 million of higher operating expenses in 2012. Our octane enhancement facility experienced extended periods of downtime during 2012, which negatively impacted sales volumes and increased operating costs. Refined products pipelines and related activities Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2013 increased $74.7 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to improved results from our TE Products Pipeline and refined products terminals and related marketing activities. Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline increased a net $24.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation fees, which accounted for a $52.3 million increase, partially offset by a $28.0 million decrease in gross operating margin attributable to lower refined products interstate transportation volumes. The higher transportation fees year-to-year include a $24.3 million benefit recognized in connection with the settlement of a rate case with certain shippers during the second quarter of 2013. Gross operating margin from our refined products terminals increased $27.8 million year-to-year primarily due to a $16.6 million benefit attributable to reductions in a provision for future pipeline capacity obligations recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Results from our refined products marketing activities increased $21.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales margins, which accounted for a $15.7 million increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $6.1 million increase. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2012 increased $10.3 million when compared to 2011. Gross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline increased $4.9 million year-to-year primarily due to a $44.1 million decrease in operating costs and expenses. Our TE Products Pipeline incurred $31.2 million of costs in 2011 related to the repair of pipeline leaks in New York State, Texas and Louisiana. The remainder of the year-to-year decrease in operating costs and expenses is primarily due to lower expenses in 2012 for operating gains and losses and costs related to transmix (i.e., the comingling of two purity products in a pipeline). Revenues earned by our TE Products Pipeline from the transportation of refined products and NGLs decreased $36.5 million year-to-year primarily due to a 26 MBPD decrease in NGL volumes delivered to Northeast U.S. markets and a 44 MBPD decrease in refined products volumes delivered to Midwest U.S. markets. In general, warmer weather during 2012 compared to 2011 resulted in lower demand for propane used as heating fuel, while shipments of refined products from the Gulf Coast to Midwest markets decreased as a result of lower prices for such products in Midwestern markets than in Gulf Coast markets. Structural shifts in population, reduced demand and increased refinery production in the Midwest have contributed to a decline in demand for the transportation of refined products from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest. Gross operating margin from the marketing of refined products increased $4.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales margins during 2012. 87 Table of Contents Marine transportation and other Comparison of 2013 with 2012. Gross operating margin from our marine transportation and other segment services for 2013 decreased $27.5 million when compared to 2012. Results attributable to our marine transportation business for 2012 included a $24.0 million gain recorded in connection with a legal settlement. Excluding the effect of the 2012 legal settlement, gross operating margin from our marine transportation business increased $8.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher fees. Gross operating margin from other segment services decreased $12.3 million year-to-year primarily due to the sale of our petrochemical trucking and lubrication oil and specialty chemical distribution assets during 2013. These businesses posted gross operating margin of $11.2 million for 2012 compared to a loss of $1.1 million for 2013. Comparison of 2012 with 2011. Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other segment services for 2012 increased $39.8 million when compared to 2011. Results for 2012 include a $24.0 million gain recorded in connection with a legal settlement. The remainder of the year-to-year increase in gross operating margin is primarily due to the combination of $10.4 million in higher marine transportation fees and a $4.7 million decrease in operating expenses associated with our fleet of marine vessels during 2012. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2013, we had $4.1 billion of consolidated liquidity, which is defined as unrestricted cash on hand plus borrowing capacity available under EPO’s bank facilities. Unrestricted cash on hand at December 31, 2013 was $56.9 million. Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs. We expect to issue additional equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future liquidity requirements, including those related to capital spending. In June 2013, we filed with the SEC a new universal shelf registration statement (the “2013 Shelf”) that replaced our prior universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in July 2010 (the “2010 Shelf”). The 2013 Shelf allows (and the prior 2010 Shelf allowed) Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and EPO (each on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. In October 2013, we filed a registration statement with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $1.25 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings. Pursuant to the “at-the-market” program, we may sell common units under an equity distribution agreement between Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and certain broker-dealers from time-to-time by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement. The new registration statement replaced our prior registration statement with respect to the at-the-market program, which was filed with the SEC in March 2012 and covered the issuance of up to $1.0 billion of our common units. After giving effect to sales of common units under the at-the-market program from its inception through February 1, 2014, we have the capacity to issue additional common units up to an aggregate sales price of $1.25 billion. 88 Table of Contents Consolidated Debt We had $17.36 billion of principal amounts outstanding under consolidated debt agreements at December 31, 2013. The following table presents scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2013 for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): Scheduled Maturities of Debt Total 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 After 2018 Commercial Paper Notes $ 475.0 $ 475.0 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- Senior Notes 15,350.0 650.0 1,300.0 750.0 800.0 350.0 11,500.0 Junior Subordinated Notes 1,532.7 -- -- -- -- -- 1,532.7 Total $ 17,357.7 $ 1,125.0 $ 1,300.0 $ 750.0 $ 800.0 $ 350.0 $ 13,032.7 Long-term and current maturities of debt reflect the classification of such obligations at December 31, 2013 after taking into consideration EPO’s issuance of long-term senior notes in February 2014 and the use of net proceeds received from the offering to repay debt, as described below. The following information describes significant transactions that affected our consolidated debt obligations during the year ended December 31, 2013: Senior Notes Transactions. In March 2013, EPO issued $1.25 billion in principal amount of 3.35% senior notes due March 2023 (“Senior Notes HH”) and $1.0 billion in principal amount of 4.85% senior notes due March 2044 (“Senior Notes II”). Senior Notes HH were issued at 99.908% of their principal amount and Senior Notes II were issued at 99.619% of their principal amount. Net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes HH and II were used to repay debt, including (i) amounts outstanding under EPO’s $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program (which EPO used to repay $550.0 million principal amount of senior notes that matured in February 2013) and (ii) $650.0 million principal amount of senior notes that matured in April 2013, and for general company purposes. In February 2014, EPO issued $850 million in principal amount of 3.90% senior notes due February 2024 (“Senior Notes JJ”) and $1.15 billion in principal amount of 5.10% senior notes due February 2045 (“Senior Notes KK”). Senior Notes JJ were issued at 99.811% of their principal amount and Senior Notes KK were issued at 99.845% of their principal amount. Net proceeds of $1.98 billion from the issuance of Senior Notes JJ and KK were used to repay debt, including amounts then outstanding under EPO’s $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program (which EPO used to repay $500.0 million in principal amount of Senior Notes O that matured in January 2014), and for general company purposes. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has unconditionally guaranteed Senior Notes HH, II, JJ and KK on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis. These senior notes rank equal with EPO’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and are senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of EPO. These senior notes are subject to make-whole redemption rights and were issued under indentures containing certain covenants, which generally restrict EPO’s ability (with certain exceptions) to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. 364-Day Credit Agreement. In June 2013, EPO entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement with a group of lenders (the “364-Day Credit Agreement”). Under the terms of the 364-Day Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $1.0 billion at a variable interest rate for a term of 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. Borrowings under this credit agreement provide us with an additional source of liquidity to fund our capital spending program. EPO’s obligations under the 364-Day Credit Agreement are not secured by any collateral; however, they are guaranteed by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement mature on June 18, 2014, although EPO may, between 15 and 60 days prior to the maturity date, elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as a non-revolving term loan for a period of one additional year, payable on June 18, 2015. 89 Table of Contents The 364-Day Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants (affirmative and negative) and events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity date of amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement. The 364-Day Credit Agreement also restricts EPO’s ability to pay cash distributions to its parent, Enterprise Products Partners L.P., if a default or an event of default (as defined in the 364-Day Credit Agreement) has occurred and is continuing at the time such distribution is scheduled to be paid. First Amendment to $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In June 2013, EPO amended the terms of its $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date of commitments under the agreement from September 2016 to June 2018 and lower the applicable margin on borrowings. For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Issuance of Common Units The following table summarizes the issuance of Enterprise common units during the years indicated in connection with underwritten equity offerings, the at-the-market program, and quarterly DRIP and employee unit purchase plan (“EUPP”) (dollars in millions, number of units issued as shown): Number of Common Units Issued Net Cash Proceeds Received Year Ended December 31, 2011: Common units issued in connection with underwritten offering 10,350,000 $ 448.5 Common units issued in connection with the DRIP and EUPP 2,337,904 94.4 Total 12,687,904 $ 542.9 Year Ended December 31, 2012: Common units issued in connection with underwritten offering 9,200,000 $ 473.3 Common units issued in connection with the at-the-market program (1) 3,978,545 203.8 Common units issued in connection with the DRIP and EUPP 2,814,660 139.7 Total 15,993,205 $ 816.8 Year Ended December 31, 2013: Common units issued in connection with underwritten offerings 18,400,000 $ 1,039.6 Common units issued in connection with the at-the-market program 7,624,689 456.3 Common units issued in connection with the DRIP and EUPP 5,154,127 296.1 Total 31,178,816 $ 1,792.0 (1) The sale of common units under the at-the-market program was initiated during the third quarter of 2012. The following information describes significant transactions that affected our partners’ equity accounts during the year ended December 31, 2013: Underwritten equity offerings. In February 2013, we issued 9,200,000 common units to the public (including an over-allotment amount of 1,200,000 common units) at an offering price of $54.56 per unit, which generated net cash proceeds of $486.6 million. In November 2013, we issued an additional 9,200,000 common units to the public (including an over-allotment amount of 1,200,000 common units) at an offering price of $62.05 per unit. This underwritten offering generated net cash proceeds of $553.0 million. At-the-market program. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we sold 7,624,689 common units under our at-the-market program for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $460.4 million, resulting in total net cash proceeds of $456.3 million. DRIP and EUPP. We also have registration statements on file with the SEC collectively authorizing the issuance of up to 70,000,000 of our common units in connection with our DRIP. The DRIP provides unitholders of 90 Table of Contents record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional new common units. We issued a total of 5,012,414 common units under our DRIP during the year ended December 31, 2013, which generated net cash proceeds of $287.6 million. After taking into account the number of common units issued under the DRIP through December 31, 2013, we have the capacity to issue an additional 18,480,878 common units under this plan. During the year ended December 31, 2013, affiliates of privately held EPCO reinvested $100.0 million, resulting in the issuance of 1,749,498 common units under our DRIP (this amount being a component of the total common units issued in total under the DRIP during 2013). These same affiliates have expressed an interest in acquiring up to $100 million of additional common units through our DRIP during 2014. Their first $25.0 million reinvestment was made in February 2014 and resulted in the issuance of 403,315 of our common units. In addition to the DRIP, we have registration statements on file with the SEC authorizing the issuance of our common units in connection with our EUPP. In September 2013, our unitholders approved the amendment and restatement of the EUPP. As a result, the maximum number of common units issuable under the EUPP increased from 440,879 common units to 4,000,000 common units. In addition, the term of the EUPP was extended to September 2023. We issued 141,713 common units under our EUPP during the year ended December 31, 2013, which generated net cash proceeds of $8.5 million. After taking into account the number of common units issued under the EUPP through December 31, 2013, we may issue an additional 3,713,444 common units under the amended and restated EUPP. Use of proceeds. The net cash proceeds we received from the issuance of common units during the year ended December 31, 2013 were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under EPO’s Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program and for general company purposes. For additional information regarding our issuance of common units and related registration statements, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Credit Ratings As of March 3, 2014, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s and Baa1 from Moody’s. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO’s short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor’s and P-2 from Moody’s. Fitch Ratings issued non-solicited ratings of BBB+ and F-2 for EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt securities and short-term senior unsecured debt securities, respectively. EPO’s credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 3,865.5 $ 2,890.9 $ 3,330.5 Cash used in investing activities $ 4,257.5 $ 3,018.8 $ 2,777.6 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 432.8 $ 124.2 $ (598.6 ) 91 Table of Contents Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. As a result, these cash flows are exposed to certain risks. We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry. We provide products and services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals. The products that we process, sell, transport or store are principally used as fuel for residential, agricultural and commercial heating; as feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing; by crude oil refineries; and in the production of motor gasoline. Reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers, whether because of a decline in general economic conditions, reduced demand for the end products made with our products, or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons, could have a negative impact on our earnings and operating cash flows. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report. The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts: Comparison of 2013 with 2012 Operating Activities. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $974.6 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: § a $356.1 million increase in cash attributable to higher partnership income in 2013 compared to 2012 (after adjusting our $179.1 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); § a $134.9 million increase in cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates for 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to improved results from our investments in crude oil pipeline joint ventures; § a $169.8 million year-to-year increase in cash attributable to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to operations; and § a $266.4 million decrease in cash used for inventories. For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see “Results of Operations” within this Part II, Item 7. Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $1.24 billion when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. The year-to-year increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to higher investments in unconsolidated affiliates to fund their capital spending programs and lower cash proceeds received from asset sales, partially offset by lower cash payments for consolidated property, plant and equipment. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates increased $484.6 million for 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to contributions we made in connection with expansion projects for the Seaway Pipeline, Texas Express Pipeline, Front Range Pipeline and Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline joint ventures. Proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries decreased from $1.20 billion for 2012 to $280.6 million for 2013. Proceeds for 2012 include the $1.1 billion we received in connection with sales of common units of Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (“Energy Transfer Equity”). For additional information regarding the liquidation of our investment in Energy Transfer Equity, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Proceeds for 2013 primarily reflect $86.9 million we received from the sale of the Stratton Ridge-to-Mont Belvieu segment of the Seminole Pipeline, $65.0 million from the sale of certain pipeline linefill volumes, $35.3 million we received from the sale of lubrication oil and specialty chemical distribution assets and $29.5 million we received from the sale of chemical trucking assets. Capital spending for consolidated property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs, decreased $216.3 million for 2013 compared to 2012. 92 Table of Contents Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities increased $308.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. The year-to-year increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was primarily due to the following: § Net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units in 2013 increased $975.2 million when compared to 2012. We issued an aggregate of 31,178,816 common units in connection with two underwritten offerings, our at-the-market program and DRIP and EUPP during 2013, which collectively generated $1.79 billion of net cash proceeds. This compares to an aggregate 15,993,205 common units we issued in connection with an underwritten offering, our at-the-market program and DRIP and EUPP during 2012, which collectively generated $816.8 million of net cash proceeds; § Cash contributions from noncontrolling interests increased $108.8 million year-to-year primarily due to contributions we received from Western Gas in connection with a new joint venture involving two NGL fractionators at our complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas; partially offset by § Cash distributions paid to limited partners in 2013 increased $221.7 million when compared to 2012 due to increases in both the number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the quarterly cash distribution rates per unit; and § Net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements decreased $514.5 million year-to-year. EPO issued $2.25 billion and repaid $1.2 billion in principal amount of senior notes during 2013, compared to the issuance of $2.5 billion and repayment of $1.0 billion in principal amount of senior notes during 2012. In addition, net cash inflows attributable to the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program were $127.2 million for 2013 compared to $346.4 million for 2012. Lastly, net repayments under EPO’s $3.5 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Facility were $150.0 million for 2012. Comparison of 2012 with 2011 Operating Activities. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $439.6 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. The year-to-year decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: § a $485.8 million year-to-year decrease in cash generally due to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to operations; § a $363.6 million increase in cash used for inventories § an $80.6 million decrease in cash distributions from Energy Transfer Equity (we liquidated our investment in this entity in April 2012); partially offset by § a $442.5 million increase in cash attributable to higher partnership income in 2012 compared to 2011 (after adjusting our $339.7 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); and § a $39.7 million increase in distributions from investments in crude oil pipeline joint ventures. Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased $241.2 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to increased investments in unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by reduced capital expenditures and higher proceeds from asset sales. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates increased $579.5 million year-to-year primarily due to capital expenditures incurred in connection with modifications to and expansion of the Seaway Pipeline, construction of the Texas Express Pipeline and those involving the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline. Capital spending for consolidated property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs, decreased $244.1 million year-to-year. Lastly, proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries increased $145.0 million year-to-year primarily due to the liquidation of our remaining investment in Energy Transfer Equity in 2012. 93 Table of Contents Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to cash used in financing activities of $598.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The $722.8 million change in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to the following: § Net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements increased $738.4 million year-to-year. EPO issued $2.5 billion and repaid $1.0 billion in principal amount of senior notes during 2012, compared to the issuance of $2.75 billion and repayment of $450.0 million in principal amount of senior notes during 2011. In addition, net repayments under our consolidated revolving bank credit facilities, term loans and other debt obligations decreased $1.19 billion year-to-year. Lastly, net cash inflows attributable to the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program, which was initiated in 2012, were $346.4 million; § Net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units in 2012 increased $273.9 million when compared to 2011. We issued an aggregate of 15,993,205 common units in connection with an underwritten offering, our at-the-market program and DRIP and EUPP during 2012, which collectively generated $816.8 million of net cash proceeds. This compares to an aggregate of 12,687,904 common units we issued in connection with an underwritten offering and our DRIP and EUPP during 2011, which collectively generated $542.9 million of net cash proceeds; partially offset by § Cash distributions paid to limited partners in 2012 increased $204.3 million when compared to 2011 due to increases in both the number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the quarterly cash distribution rates per unit; and § Cash outflows related to the monetization of interest rate derivative instruments increased $124.6 million year-to-year. In connection with senior notes issued in 2012, we settled a number of forward starting and fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps resulting in a combined net cash outflow of $147.8 million. In connection with senior notes issued in 2011, we settled a number of forward starting swaps and treasury locks resulting in a net cash outflow of $23.2 million. For information regarding our interest rate hedging activities, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Designated Units Issued in Connection with Holdings Merger In November 2010, we completed the merger of Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Holdings Merger”). In connection with the Holdings Merger, a privately held affiliate of EPCO agreed to temporarily waive the regular quarterly cash distributions it would otherwise receive from us with respect to a certain number of our common units it owns (the “Designated Units”). Distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2013 excluded 23,700,000 Designated Units. Distributions to be paid, if any, during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 will exclude 22,560,000 Designated Units and 17,690,000 Designated Units, respectively. Conversion of Class B Units to Common Units in 2013 In October 2009, we completed the merger of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries with TEPPCO Partners, L.P. (“TEPPCO”). In connection with this merger, we issued 4,520,431 Class B units to a privately held affiliate of EPCO. The Class B units were entitled to vote together with our common units as a single class on partnership matters and generally had the same rights and privileges as our common units, except that the Class B units were not entitled to receive regular quarterly cash distributions until they automatically converted into an equal number of our common units. This conversion took place in August 2013. Capital Spending An important part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are positioned to continue to expand our system of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and 94 Table of Contents crude oil production resulting from development activities in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, Northeast and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, including the Niobrara, Barnett, Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville, Marcellus and Utica Shale plays and deepwater Gulf of Mexico production fields. Although our current focus is on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, asset acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions. In past years, major oil and gas companies have sold non-strategic assets in the midstream energy sector in which we operate. We believe this trend will continue and we expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestitures. See “Significant Recent Developments” within this Part II, Item 7 for information regarding our current major capital projects, including the completion of several new NGL pipelines such as the Front Range Pipeline, Texas Express Pipeline and ATEX Express pipeline. The following table summarizes our capital spending for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Capital spending for property, plant and equipment, net: (1) Growth capital projects (2) $ 3,088.0 $ 3,232.7 $ 3,552.3 Sustaining capital projects (3) 294.2 365.8 290.3 Investments in unconsolidated affiliates 1,094.1 609.5 30.0 Other investing activities 1.0 43.1 22.4 Total capital spending $ 4,477.3 $ 4,251.1 $ 3,895.0 (1) On certain of our capital projects, third parties are obligated to reimburse us for all or a portion of project expenditures. The majority of such arrangements are associated with pipeline construction projects and production well tie-ins. Contributions in aid of construction costs were $26.0 million, $23.4 million and $24.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented net of related contributions in aid of construction costs. (2) Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. Our most significant growth capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2013 involved projects in the Eagle Ford Shale, at our Mont Belvieu complex, to expand joint venture crude oil pipelines and for the ATEX Express pipeline. We currently expect total capital spending for 2014 to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.4 billion, which includes $350 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our forecast of capital spending for 2014 is based on our announced strategic operating and growth plans (through the filing date of this annual report), which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities. We may revise our forecast of capital spending due to factors beyond our control, such as weather related issues, changes in supplier prices or adverse economic conditions. Furthermore, our forecast of capital spending may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include the addition of costs in connection with unforeseen acquisition opportunities. Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a principal factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we currently expect to make the forecast capital expenditures noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions. 95 Table of Contents At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $1.14 billion in purchase commitments outstanding that relate to our capital spending for property, plant and equipment. These commitments primarily relate to the ATEX Express pipeline and construction projects in Texas and the Rocky Mountains. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we placed approximately $2.3 billion of major capital projects into service. We expect to complete construction and begin commercial operations related to growth capital spending representing approximately $5.0 billion of investment during 2014. These projects include our: § ATEX Express pipeline, which commenced operations in January 2014; § Mid-America Pipeline System expansion project in the Rocky Mountains, which commenced operations in January 2014; § Front Range Pipeline, which commenced operations in February 2014; § Seaway Pipeline looping project (expected completion in second quarter of 2014); § ECHO terminal expansion project (Phase II expected completion in second quarter of 2014); § refined products export terminal (expected completion in third quarter of 2014); § SEKCO crude oil pipeline (expected completion in third quarter of 2014); and § Aegis Ethane Pipeline (portions expected to be completed in third quarter of 2014). Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following describes the estimation risk currently underlying our most significant financial statement items: Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Our estimate of depreciation expense incorporates management assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected salvage values, or (iv) significant changes in the forecast life of proved reserves of applicable resource basins, if any. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $26.95 billion and $24.85 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.01 billion, $900.5 million and $776.6 million in depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 96 Table of Contents Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil or refined products. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated salvage values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of a long-lived asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset’s estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include usage of probabilities for a range of possible outcomes. An equity method investment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a possible permanent loss in value of the investment (i.e., other than a temporary decline). Examples of such events include sustained operating losses of the investee or long-term negative changes in the investee’s industry. When evidence of a loss in value has occurred, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment’s underlying assets. A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $92.6 million, $63.4 million and $27.8 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. During 2013, we evaluated our equity method investment in Neptune for impairment. As a result of this evaluation, we recorded a $4.8 million non-cash impairment charge that is a component of equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2013. There were no impairment charges in 2012 and 2011 related to our equity method investments. For additional information regarding our equity method investments, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Amortization Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Qualifying Intangible Assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential identifiable intangible assets include items such as intellectual property, customer contracts and relationships, and non-compete agreements. The method used to value each intangible asset will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value we assigned to information about customers and the ability to have regular contact with them as a result of business combinations and assets purchases. These relationships may arise from formal contractual arrangements or through routine contact by sales or service representatives. The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the economic benefits of the associated oil and natural gas resource basins from which the customers produce are estimated to be depleted. Our estimate of the useful life of each resource 97 Table of Contents basin is predicated on a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. Our contract-based intangible assets represent rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements, such as the long-term rights we possess under the Shell natural gas processing agreement and the Jonah natural gas transportation contracts. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated useful life (or term), which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of useful life are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a fractionation facility, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights, and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such agreements. If our assumptions regarding the estimated useful life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset’s unamortized cost is not recoverable due to impairment, we would be required to reduce the asset’s carrying value to its estimated fair value. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was $1.46 billion and $1.57 billion, respectively. We recorded $105.6 million, $125.7 million and $147.0 million in amortization expense associated with our intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is subject to annual impairment testing at the end of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if circumstances indicate it is probable that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount. Goodwill impairment testing involves determining the fair value of the associated reporting unit. These fair value amounts are based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the businesses that make up the reporting unit. Such assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the businesses contained within the reporting unit, which rely on management’s estimates of operating margins, throughput volumes and similar factors; (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. If the fair value of a reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a charge to operating costs and expenses is required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its implied fair value. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value (i.e., by at least 10%). At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying value of our goodwill was $2.08 billion and $2.09 billion, respectively. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2013, 2012 or 2011. For additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Revenue Recognition Policies and Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses In general, we recognize revenue from customers when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. We record revenue when sales contracts are settled (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed). We record any necessary allowance for doubtful accounts as required by our established policy. For additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 98 Table of Contents Our use of estimates for certain revenues and expenses has increased as a result of SEC regulations that require us to submit financial information on accelerated time frames. Such estimates are necessary due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes. One example of our use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of processing plant revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month (prior to receiving actual customer and vendor-related plant operating information for a specific period). These estimates reverse in the following month and are offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor-invoiced amounts. Accordingly, we include one month of certain estimated data in our results of operations. Such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and estimated for the remainder of the month. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. If the assumptions underlying our revenue and expense estimates prove to be substantially incorrect, it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods. We review our estimates based on currently available information. Other Items Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure Our non-GAAP gross operating margin by business segment and in total is as follows for the periods presented (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 NGL Pipelines & Services $ 2,514.4 $ 2,468.5 $ 2,184.2 Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services 789.0 775.5 675.3 Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services 742.7 387.7 234.0 Offshore Pipeline & Services 146.1 173.0 228.2 Petrochemical & Refined Products Services 625.9 579.9 535.2 Other Investments (1) -- 2.4 14.8 Total segment gross operating margin $ 4,818.1 $ 4,387.0 $ 3,871.7 (1) Represents the equity earnings we recorded from our previously held investment in Energy Transfer Equity. Our reporting for this segment ceased on January 18, 2012 when we stopped using the equity method to account for this investment. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding the liquidation of our investment in Energy Transfer Equity. 99 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of non-GAAP total segment gross operating margin to GAAP operating income and further to income before income taxes for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Total segment gross operating margin $ 4,818.1 $ 4,387.0 $ 3,871.7 Adjustments to reconcile total segment gross operating margin to operating income: Subtract depreciation, amortization and accretion expense amounts not reflected in gross operating margin (1,148.9 ) (1,061.7 ) (958.7 ) Subtract impairment charges not reflected in gross operating margin (92.6 ) (63.4 ) (27.8 ) Subtract operating lease expenses paid by EPCO not reflected in gross operating margin -- -- (0.3 ) Add gains and subtract losses attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries not reflected in gross operating margin 83.4 17.6 156.0 Subtract non-refundable deferred revenues included in gross operating margin attributable to shipper make-up rights on new pipeline projects (4.4 ) -- -- Subtract general and administrative costs not reflected in gross operating margin (188.3 ) (170.3 ) (181.8 ) Operating income 3,467.3 3,109.2 2,859.1 Other expense, net (802.7 ) (698.4 ) (743.6 ) Income before income taxes $ 2,664.6 $ 2,410.8 $ 2,115.5 We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by our executive management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. In total, gross operating margin represents operating income exclusive of (1) depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, (2) impairment charges, (3) gains and losses attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries and (4) general and administrative costs. As discussed below, gross operating margin includes equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates and non-refundable deferred transportation revenues relating to the make-up rights of committed shippers associated with certain pipelines. Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses (net of the adjustments noted above) from segment revenues, with both segment totals before the elimination of intercompany transactions. In accordance with GAAP, intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. We include equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin and operating income. Equity investments with industry partners are a significant component of our business strategy. They are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with those of customers and/or suppliers. This method of operation enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed. Many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other midstream business operations. Management includes deferred transportation revenues relating to the make-up rights of committed shippers when reviewing the financial results of certain major new pipeline projects such as the Texas Express Pipeline and Seaway Pipeline. Certain shippers on these systems did not meet their minimum volume commitment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, thus revenues associated with each shipper’s make-up rights were deferred in accordance with GAAP. From an internal (and segment) reporting standpoint, management considers the transportation fees paid by committed shippers on major new pipeline projects, including any non-refundable revenues that may be deferred under GAAP related to make-up rights, to be important in assessing the financial 100 Table of Contents performance of these pipeline assets. From a GAAP perspective, the revenue streams associated with these make-up rights are deferred until the earlier of (i) the deficiency volumes are shipped, (ii) the contractual make-up period expires or (iii) the pipeline is otherwise released from its performance obligation. Since management includes these deferred revenues in non-GAAP gross operating margin, these amounts are deducted in determining GAAP-based operating income. Our consolidated revenues do not reflect any deferred revenues until the conditions for recognizing such revenues are met in accordance with GAAP. Management expects that several of our new pipeline projects, including the ATEX Express pipeline, Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline, will experience periods where shippers are unable to meet their contractual minimum volume commitments during 2014. We anticipate that committed shipper transportation volumes on ATEX Express may be negatively impacted by producer drilling programs, including the timing of new production well start-ups in the Marcellus and Utica Shale developments. With respect to the Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline, we expect that ethane rejection in the supply basins served by these pipelines will adversely impact shipper transportation volumes. Insurance Matters We participate as a named insured in EPCO’s insurance program, which provides us with property damage, business interruption and other insurance coverage, the scope and amounts of which we believe are customary and prudent for the nature and extent of our operations. While we believe EPCO maintains adequate insurance coverage on our behalf, insurance may not fully cover every type of damage, interruption or other loss that might occur. If we were to incur a significant loss for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there may be timing differences between amounts we accrue related to property damage expense, amounts we are required to pay in connection with a loss and amounts we subsequently receive from insurance carriers as reimbursements. Any event that materially interrupts the revenues generated by our consolidated operations, or other losses that require us to make material expenditures not reimbursed by insurance, could reduce our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders and, accordingly, adversely affect the market price of our common units. Involuntary conversions result from the loss of an asset because of some unforeseen event (e.g., destruction due to fire). Some of these events are insurable, thus resulting in a property damage insurance recovery. Amounts we receive from insurance carriers are net of any deductibles related to the covered event. EPCO’s deductibles currently range from $5.0 million to $60.0 million depending on the nature of the loss (windstorm or non-windstorm) and the assets involved (onshore or offshore). We received $15.0 million, $30.0 million and $20.0 million of nonrefundable insurance proceeds during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, attributable to property damage claims we filed in connection with a February 2011 NGL release and fire at the West Storage location of our Mont Belvieu, Texas underground storage facility. Operating income for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 includes $15.0 million, $30.0 million and $4.7 million of gains, respectively, related to these insurance recoveries. The remaining West Storage claims of approximately $95.0 million are anticipated to be collected during the first quarter of 2014. To the extent that additional non-refundable cash insurance proceeds related to this incident are received, we expect to record gains equal to such proceeds. Due to the high cost of windstorm insurance coverage for our offshore Gulf of Mexico assets, we elected to self-insure these assets during the annual policy period extending from June 2012 to June 2013. We continue to self-insure these assets for the current annual policy period, which extends from June 2013 to June 2014. For additional information regarding insurance matters, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 101 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2013 (dollars in millions): Payment or Settlement due by Period Less than 1-3 4-5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1) $ 17,357.7 $ 1,125.0 $ 2,050.0 $ 1,150.0 $ 13,032.7 Estimated cash payments for interest (2) $ 18,092.0 $ 860.9 $ 1,569.2 $ 1,463.5 $ 14,198.4 Operating lease obligations (3) $ 332.8 $ 42.4 $ 79.4 $ 66.1 $ 144.9 Purchase obligations: (4) Product purchase commitments: Estimated payment obligations: Natural gas $ 4,372.0 $ 1,088.9 $ 1,759.9 $ 944.0 $ 579.2 NGLs $ 2,147.1 $ 1,917.7 $ 229.4 $ -- $ -- Crude oil $ 1,159.5 $ 1,159.5 $ -- $ -- $ -- Petrochemicals and refined products $ 3,943.6 $ 2,058.0 $ 1,817.2 $ 68.4 $ -- Other $ 117.0 $ 80.0 $ 15.1 $ 10.3 $ 11.6 Underlying major volume commitments: Natural gas (in TBtus) 1,143 282 456 256 149 NGLs (in MMBbls) 42 38 4 -- -- Crude oil (in MMBbls) 12 12 -- -- -- Petrochemicals and refined products (in MMBbls) 42 22 19 1 -- Service payment commitments (5) $ 1,030.9 $ 201.4 $ 380.4 $ 241.2 $ 207.9 Capital expenditure commitments (6) $ 1,137.5 $ 1,137.5 $ -- $ -- $ -- Other long-term liabilities (7) $ 172.3 $ -- $ 11.4 $ 8.1 $ 152.8 Total $ 49,862.4 $ 9,671.3 $ 7,912.0 $ 3,951.6 $ 28,327.5 (1) Represents scheduled future maturities of our consolidated debt principal obligations. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2013, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable fixed or variable interest rates paid during 2013. With respect to our variable-rate debt obligations, we applied the weighted-average interest rate paid during 2013 to determine the estimated cash payments. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for the weighted-average variable interest rate charged in 2013 under our revolving credit facility. In addition, our estimate of cash payments for interest gives effect to interest rate swap agreements that were in place at December 31, 2013. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding these derivative instruments. Our estimated cash payments for interest are significantly influenced by the long-term maturities of our junior subordinated notes (due August 2066 through January 2068). Our estimated cash payments for interest with respect to each junior subordinated note are based on the current fixed interest rate for each note applied to the entire remaining term through the respective maturity date. (3) Primarily represents leases of underground salt dome caverns for the storage of natural gas and NGLs, office space with affiliates of EPCO and land held pursuant to right-of-way agreements. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services as of December 31, 2013. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2013 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Primarily represents our unconditional payment obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts. (6) Represents unconditional payment obligations for services to be rendered or products to be delivered in connection with our capital spending program, including our share of the capital spending of our unconsolidated affiliates. (7) As reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013, other long-term liabilities primarily represent the noncurrent portion of asset retirement obligations and deferred revenues. For additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. 102 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Related Party Transactions For information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Regulation For information regarding the impact of federal, state or local regulatory measures on our business, see “Regulatory Matters” included under Part I, Item 1 and 2 of this annual report. Recent Accounting Developments The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) continue their joint project to converge U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards in the area of revenue recognition. As currently drafted, the converged standard eliminates the transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replaces it with a principles based approach for determining revenue recognition. It is expected that the new standard will be issued during the first quarter of 2014. Although the FASB and IASB continue their deliberations on certain revenue recognition topics, we continue to monitor developments in connection with the proposed new accounting guidance. Based on information currently available, the effective date of the new standard would be January 1, 2017. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps, options and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities. We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding and the discount rates used to determine the present values. The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming: § the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk; § the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and § the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period. We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. Accordingly, the nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. 103 Table of Contents Interest Rate Hedging Activities We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain consolidated debt agreements. This strategy is a component in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. The composition of our derivative instrument portfolios may change from period-to-period depending on our hedging requirements. With respect to the tabular data below, each portfolio’s estimated fair value at a given date is based on a number of factors, including the number and types of derivatives outstanding at that date, the notional value of the swaps and associated interest rates. Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps exchange the stated interest rate paid on a notional amount of existing debt for the fixed or floating interest rate stipulated in the derivative instrument. The following table summarizes our portfolio of interest rate swaps at December 31, 2013 (dollars in millions): Hedged Transaction Number and Type of Derivatives Outstanding Notional Amount Period of Hedge Rate Swap Accounting Treatment Senior Notes AA 10 fixed-to-floating swaps $ 750.0 1/2011 to 2/2016 3.2% to 1.2% Fair value hedge Undesignated swaps 6 floating-to-fixed swaps $ 600.0 5/2010 to 7/2014 0.2% to 2.0% Mark-to-market The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value (“FV”) of our interest rate swap portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Interest Rate Swap Portfolio Aggregate Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 January 31, 2014 FV assuming no change in underlying interest rates Asset $ 28.0 $ 24.8 $ 28.3 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying interest rates Asset 27.2 24.1 27.7 FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying interest rates Asset 28.8 25.5 28.9 Forward-starting interest rate swaps Forward starting swaps perform a similar function as traditional interest rate swaps except that they are associated with interest rates underlying anticipated future issuances of debt. The 16 forward starting swaps outstanding at December 31, 2012 with an aggregate notional value of $1.0 billion were settled at a loss of $168.8 million in March 2013 in connection with the issuance of Senior Notes HH and II. There were no forward starting swaps outstanding at December 31, 2013. Commodity Hedging Activities The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps, basis swaps and option contracts. 104 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2013 (volume measures as noted): Volume (1) Accounting Derivative Purpose Current (2) Long-Term (2) Treatment Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas processing: Forecasted natural gas purchases for plant thermal reduction (Bcf) 7.0 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs (MMBbls) 1.1 n/a Cash flow hedge Octane enhancement: Forecasted purchases of NGLs (MMBbls) 0.4 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of octane enhancement products (MMBbls) 3.1 0.1 Cash flow hedge Natural gas marketing: Forecasted sales of natural gas (Bcf) 2.6 n/a Cash flow hedge Natural gas storage inventory management activities (Bcf) 8.2 n/a Fair value hedge NGL marketing: Forecasted purchases of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 5.9 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of NGLs and related hydrocarbon products (MMBbls) 5.4 n/a Cash flow hedge Refined products marketing: Forecasted purchases of refined products (MMBbls) 0.6 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of refined products (MMBbls) 1.6 n/a Cash flow hedge Refined products inventory management activities (MMBbls) 0.1 n/a Fair value hedge Crude oil marketing: Forecasted purchases of crude oil (MMBbls) 4.0 n/a Cash flow hedge Forecasted sales of crude oil (MMBbls) 5.8 n/a Cash flow hedge Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Natural gas risk management activities (Bcf) (3,4) 94.7 19.7 Mark-to-market Refined products risk management activities (MMBbls) (4) 0.8 n/a Mark-to-market Crude oil risk management activities (MMBbls) (4) 14.4 n/a Mark-to-market (1) Volume for derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflects the total amount of volumes hedged whereas volume for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflects the absolute value of derivative notional volumes. (2) The maximum term for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is January 2015, May 2014 and October 2016, respectively. (3) Current volumes include 27.5 Bcf of physical derivative instruments that are predominantly priced at a marked-based index plus a premium or minus a discount related to location differences. (4) Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with transportation, processing and storage assets. As of January 31, 2014, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory, (iii) hedging natural gas processing margins, and (iv) hedging octane enhancement margins. The following information summarizes these hedging strategies: § The objective of our anticipated future commodity purchases and sales hedging program is to hedge the margins of certain transportation, storage and blending activities by locking in purchases and sales prices through the use of forward contracts and derivative instruments. § The objective of our inventory hedging program is to hedge the fair value of commodity products currently held in inventory by locking in the sales price of the inventory through the use of forward contracts and derivative instruments. § The objective of our natural gas processing hedging program is to hedge an amount of gross margin associated with these activities. We achieve this objective by executing forward fixed-price sales of a portion of our expected equity NGL production using forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. For certain natural gas processing contracts, the hedging of expected equity NGL production also involves the purchase of natural gas for plant thermal reduction, which is hedged by executing forward fixed-price purchases using forward contracts and derivative instruments. § The objective of our octane enhancement hedging program is to hedge an amount of gross margin associated with these activities. We achieve this objective by executing forward fixed-price sales of a 105 Table of Contents portion of our expected octane enhancement product volumes and forward fixed-price purchases of NGL feedstocks using forward contracts and derivative instruments. Certain basis swaps, basis spread options and other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are used to manage market risks associated with anticipated purchases and sales of commodity products. There is some uncertainty involved in the timing of these transactions often due to the development of more favorable profit opportunities or when spreads are insufficient to cover variable costs thus reducing the likelihood that the transactions will occur during the periods originally forecasted. In accordance with derivatives accounting guidance, these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting even though they are effective at managing the risk exposures of the underlying assets. Due to volatility in commodity prices, any non-cash, mark-to-market earnings variability cannot be predicted. The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our natural gas marketing portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 January 31, 2014 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ 7.6 $ (1.3 ) $ (1.5 ) FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) 3.0 (6.7 ) (4.5 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 12.2 4.1 1.6 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our NGL marketing, refined products marketing and octane enhancement portfolios at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 January 31, 2014 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ 10.5 $ (20.7 ) $ 9.5 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Liability (27.5 ) (69.8 ) (28.1 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 48.5 28.5 47.0 The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements (a sensitivity analysis) on the estimated fair value of our crude oil marketing portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in millions): Portfolio Fair Value at Scenario Resulting Classification December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 January 31, 2014 FV assuming no change in underlying commodity prices Asset (Liability) $ (2.0 ) $ 8.2 $ 10.9 FV assuming 10% increase in underlying commodity prices Liability (10.0 ) (9.8 ) (2.0 ) FV assuming 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices Asset 6.1 26.1 23.9 Product Purchase Commitments We have long and short-term purchase commitments for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products.
