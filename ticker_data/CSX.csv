277948,CSX,CSX CORP,2008,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15, Business Segments. 7 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company’s forward-looking statements. Although the risks described below are those that management believes are the most significant, these are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity. New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company’s earnings or regulate its ability to independently negotiate prices. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, the FRA and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. Legislation passed by Congress or regulations issued by these agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company’s business. For example, regulations imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company’s profitability. Also, additional regulations related to environmental matters such as greenhouse gas emissions or legislative changes impacting hours of service requirements could adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation. A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation. CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. Failure to comply with these regulations can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances. The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs. The Company’s operations are subject to wide-ranging federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, discharges into water, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and clean-up of hazardous material or petroleum releases. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned and used by the Company. 8 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I The Company has been, and may be subject to, allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company’s incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. General economic, geo-political and compliance risks may affect the Company’s operations and financial results. Changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for rail or intermodal services could adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, abrupt political change or terrorist activity poses a risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in the operations and security arrangements, thus increasing the operating costs. These conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and purchasing decisions by the Company’s customers. Fuel prices and supply are influenced by international political and economic circumstances. Although a fuel recovery program is in place with a considerable number of customers, the Company could be negatively impacted if it were unable to realize fuel surcharges. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted. The FRA regulates several of the Company’s core operations including track and mechanical equipment standards, signaling systems, inspection of grade crossing warning devices, locomotive engineer certifications and employee injury reporting, among other areas. The Company’s unintentional failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in CSX. In addition, a change in these regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Network congestion, caused by unanticipated increases in freight or passenger activity, could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency. The Company may experience rail network difficulties related to network capacity, unplanned increases in demand for rail service, increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas or regulatory changes impacting when CSXT can transport freight or its service routes that could have a negative effect on the Company’s operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency. In addition, the Company may face external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes, which may disrupt the Company’s operations. 9 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company faces inherent business risk from exposure to property damage, occupational injury claims, and personal injury claims resulting from train accidents, worker injury claims under FELA and claims from outside parties resulting from the Company’s operations. Although the Company is working diligently to enhance its safety programs and to continue to raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety, the Company could experience material property damage, personal injury or occupational claims in the future and it may incur significant costs to defend such claims. Existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company’s control. The Company establishes reserves to cover all of these types of claims. However, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves. The Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. The Company is subject to various existing lawsuits and potential unknown litigation. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend any such lawsuits. Additionally, existing litigation may suffer adverse development not currently reflected in the Company’s reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company’s control. While the Company uses its best efforts to evaluate existing litigation, the final judgments may differ materially from the recorded reserves. Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company’s operations. Terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred in the United States in September 2001, in Spain in March 2004, in England in July 2005, and in India in July 2006, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity. CSXT’s rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and beginning to adopt various legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the DHS proposed regulations that would require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. 10 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSXT's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Generally speaking, these agreements are bargained nationally by the National Carriers Committee. In the rail industry, negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Over the last 30 years, there were only six days of work stoppage related to labor disputes over national handling. If the Company is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, it could result in strikes by the affected workers, loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Under the Railway Labor Act’s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of Presidential intervention), neither party may exercise self-help until the procedures are exhausted. The Company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business. The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. A significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, software and communications equipment, could result in a service interruption, safety failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. While the Company has taken steps to mitigate these risks, the performance and reliability of its technology systems are critical to its ability to compete effectively. The Company faces competition from rail carriers and other transportation providers. The Company experiences competition in the form of pricing, service, reliability and other factors from other transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks using largely internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 11 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties by Segment Rail Property CSXT’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars. These categories and the geography of the network are described below. Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the Midwestern cities of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago. CSXT’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards (known as mainline track); track within terminals and switching yards; track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains; track connecting the mainline track to customer locations; and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles are greater than the Company’s approximately 21,000 route miles, which reflect the size of CSX’s rail network that connects markets, customers and western railroads. At December 2007, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track Miles Mainline track 26,712 Terminals and switching yards 9,626 Passing sidings and turnouts 1,037 Total 37,375 In addition to its physical track structure, CSXT operates numerous yards and terminals. These serve as the hubs between CSXT and its local customers and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received, re-sorted and placed onto new outbound trains. 12 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I The following 36 yards are identified as key to the CSXT system (listed in alphabetical order by state): Rail Yards or Terminals Birmingham, AL Detroit, MI Mobile, AL Hamlet, NC Montgomery, AL Rocky Mount, NC Baldwin, FL Buffalo, NY Moncrief (Jacksonville), FL Selkirk, NY Tampa, FL Syracuse, NY Atlanta, GA Cincinnati, OH East Savannah, GA Cleveland, OH Waycross, GA Columbus, OH Avon (Indianapolis), IN Stanley (Toledo), OH Chicago, IL Walbridge (Toledo), OH Evansville, IN Willard, OH Louisville, KY Greenwich (Philadelphia), PA Russell, KY Charleston, SC New Orleans, LA Florence, SC Cumberland, MD Erwin, TN Curtis Bay (Baltimore), MD Nashville, TN Locust Point (Baltimore), MD Richmond, VA For a list of Intermodal’s terminals, see page 16. Network Geography CSXT’s train operations are primarily focused around the following four major transportation networks, which are defined geographically or by line of business and are described below. Coal Network – Coal is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the United States. The CSXT coal network connects mining operations in nine states with industrial areas in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake and seaport facilities. This network also supports the strong, growing utility market in the southeast. Southeastern Corridor – This section of the network runs from the western gateways of Chicago, Memphis and St. Louis through the growing cities of Nashville, Birmingham and Atlanta and into the expanding markets in the southeast. CSXT’s capacity investment in this corridor clearly strengthens this route and makes it the premier rail route connecting these key cities and gateways with the growing southeast. The corridor extends through the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and provides direct rail service between these coal sources and the increasing demand for coal in the southeast. The increase in capacity on this corridor positions CSXT well to handle the projected traffic volumes of intermodal, coal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. 13 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – Chicago and metropolitan areas in New York and New England are linked by CSXT’s I-90 Corridor. Much of this route has two lanes of track side-by-side (referred to as double mainline track) supporting high-speed intermodal and automotive services. The I-90 Corridor is also a primary route for import traffic moving across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the northeast. Continued growth in consumption in the east and northeast makes this corridor a critical element in the Company’s overall system. Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the growing southeast are connected to the heavily populated northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York along CSXT’s I-95 Corridor. This route is primarily used to ship food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals. It is the only rail corridor along the east coast south of Washington, D.C., and provides access to all the major eastern ports. Locomotives CSXT focuses on maximum use of its fleet and prudent investment in new units to drive the rail network. Better locomotive management helps CSXT move freight more efficiently, while continued investment in CSXT’s power source means CSXT is operating more locomotives better. CSXT operates more than 4,000 locomotives, of which over 95% are owned by CSXT. Freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull rail cars. Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar gets attached to the right train in order to get it to its final destination. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. At December 2007, CSXT’s owned and long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following: Locomotives % Freight 3,495 87% Switching 324 8% Auxiliary Units 188 5% Total 4,007 100% Freight Car Fleet The average daily fleet of cars-on-line consists of approximately 222,000 cars, but at any point in time, over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by CSXT. Examples of these are: railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service) and multi-level railcars. 14 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I CSXT’s freight car fleet consists of six main types of cars: Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel. Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions. Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine. Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers. Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles. Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood. Other cars owned or leased on the network include, but are not limited to, center beam cars for transporting lumber and building products. CSXT owns more than 60% of its freight cars. At December 2007, CSXT’s owned and long-term leased freight car fleet consisted of the following: Freight Cars % Gondolas 26,490 28% Open-top hoppers 19,604 21% Box cars 13,911 15% Covered hoppers 13,555 14% Multi-level flat cars 12,340 13% Flat cars 7,189 8% Other cars 1,275 1% Total 94,364 100% 15 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Intermodal Property Infrastructure Intermodal serves 51 terminals in 22 states. These terminals serve as a transfer point between rail and trucks. If the city has more than one terminal, it is indicated by the number next to it. Intermodal Terminals Mobile, AL Kansas City, MO Lathrop, CA Charlotte, NC Los Angeles/Long Beach, CA (3) North Bergen, NJ Oakland, CA Blasdell, NY Jacksonville, FL (2) Syracuse, NY Orlando, FL New York, NY/NJ (5) Tampa, FL Cincinnati, OH Atlanta, GA (2) Cleveland, OH Savannah, GA (2) Columbus, OH (2) Chicago, IL (2) Marion, OH East St. Louis, IL Portland, OR Avon, IN Chambersburg, PA Evansville, IN Philadelphia, PA New Orleans, LA Charleston, SC Boston, MA Memphis, TN Springfield, MA Nashville, TN Worcester, MA (3) Mesquite, TX Baltimore, MD Portsmouth, VA Detroit, MI Seattle, WA Equipment Intermodal equipment consists primarily of containers, chassis and other equipment (such as lift equipment). Containers are weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight, and chassis are the wheeled support framework for a container that allows it to be attached to a tractor. All of Intermodal’s chassis are leased. Intermodal also has other types of equipment such as doublestack railcars, which are railcars that allow for two containers to be mounted one above the other. At December 28, 2007, Intermodal owned or long-term leased equipment consisted of the following: Equipment % Chassis 25,980 67% Containers 12,503 32% Other 433 1% Total 38,916 100% 16 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. For more information on legal proceedings, see Item 7.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17 Business Segments. 7 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company’s forward-looking statements. Although the risks described below are those that management believes are the most significant, these are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company’s earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices. Political changes could result in legislative or regulatory changes that impose new burdens on the Company, increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or limit revenues. Legislation passed by Congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company’s business. The railroad industry is vulnerable to economic re-regulation by Congress, which could have a significant negative impact on the Company’s ability to determine prices for rail services and would likely force a reduction in capital spending. For example, statutes imposing price or labor constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company’s profitability. Also, additional regulations related to environmental matters such as greenhouse gas emissions could increase the Company’s operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies or impact the business of CSX customers. Government regulation and compliance risks may affect the Company’s operations and financial results. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, the FRA and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. The FRA regulates several of the Company’s core operations including track and mechanical equipment standards, signaling systems, inspection of grade crossing warning devices, locomotive engineer certifications and employee injury reporting, among other areas. In addition, the DOT and DHS have crafted rules requiring new safety measures and security protocols. These regulations will increase operational costs and affect freight transportation routes. Legislation recently enacted by Congress will also increase compliance risks. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 imposes limits on employee work hours and may result in higher operating costs for the Company. Noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. In addition, a change in these regulations could increase operating costs and reduce operating efficiency. 8 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I General economic conditions could negatively impact demand for commodities and other freight. The current economic environment has impacted demand for rail and intermodal services. Further decline in general domestic and global economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities that the Company carries or that lead to bankruptcies or liquidations of one or more large customers of the Company could reduce the Company’s revenues, increase its bad debt expense, reduce its ability to make capital expenditures or have other adverse effects. Because certain of the Company’s customers are in the automotive, housing and other industries, continued weakness or further downturns in these sectors could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital. The Company is in a capital intensive industry that requires continuing infrastructure improvements and acquisition of capital assets. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. Credit markets have recently experienced adverse conditions, increasing the costs associated with issuing debt. These conditions may further increase the Company’s funding costs, limit the Company’s ability to sell debt securities on acceptable terms and impede the Company’s attempts to revise its current debt arrangements as contemplated. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation. A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation. Such claims could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems, and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could result in increased operating costs, reduced operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials. 9 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company’s operations. Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT’s rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted various legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the DHS adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these regulations could continue to increase the Company’s operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies. The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs. The Company’s operations are subject to wide-ranging federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, discharges into water, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and clean-up of hazardous material or petroleum releases. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned and used by the Company. The Company has been, and may be subject to, allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company’s incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing and may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. 10 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage. The Company’s operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to limitations on coverage, depending on the nature of the risk insured against. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company’s damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations. The Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. The Company is subject to various existing lawsuits, including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws and potential unknown litigation. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend any such lawsuits. Additionally, existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company’s reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company’s control. While the Company uses its best efforts to evaluate existing litigation, the final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves. Increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company faces inherent business risk from exposure to property damage, occupational injury claims, and personal injury claims resulting from train accidents, worker injury claims under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”) and claims from outside parties resulting from the Company’s operations. The Company could experience material property damage, personal injury or occupational claims in the future and it may incur significant costs to defend such claims. Existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company’s control. Although the Company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the Company’s insurance coverage. 11 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSXT's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Generally speaking, these agreements are bargained nationally by the National Carriers Committee. In the rail industry, negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Over the last 30 years, there were only six days of work stoppage related to labor disputes over national handling. If the Company is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, it could result in strikes by the affected workers, loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. Under the Railway Labor Act’s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of Presidential intervention), neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. The Company faces competition from other transportation providers. The Company experiences competition in the form of pricing, service, reliability and other factors from other transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks using largely internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company’s competitive position. Network congestion could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency. The Company may experience rail network difficulties related to network capacity, unplanned increases in demand for rail service, increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas or regulatory changes impacting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes that could have a negative effect on the Company’s operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency. The Company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business. The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. A significant disruption or failure of the Company’s information technology systems, including computer hardware, software and communications equipment, could result in a service interruption, safety failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. While the Company has taken steps to mitigate these risks, the performance and reliability of its technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete effectively. 12 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Disruption of the supply chain could negatively impact operating efficiency and increase costs. The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, the Company could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign. Adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping, or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase the Company’s operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted. 13 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties by Segment Rail Property CSXT’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars. These categories and the geography of the network are described below. Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern cities of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago. CSXT’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards (known as mainline track), track within terminals and switching yards, track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains, track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts.

These serve as the hubs between CSXT and its local customers and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received, re-sorted and placed onto new outbound trains. 14 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I The following 36 yards are identified as key to the CSXT system (listed in alphabetical order by state): Rail Yards or Terminals Birmingham, AL Detroit, MI Mobile, AL Hamlet, NC Montgomery, AL Rocky Mount, NC Baldwin, FL Buffalo, NY Moncrief (Jacksonville), FL Selkirk, NY Tampa, FL Syracuse, NY Atlanta, GA Cincinnati, OH East Savannah, GA Cleveland, OH Waycross, GA Columbus, OH Avon (Indianapolis), IN Stanley (Toledo), OH Chicago, IL Walbridge (Toledo), OH Evansville, IN Willard, OH Louisville, KY Greenwich (Philadelphia), PA Russell, KY Charleston, SC New Orleans, LA Florence, SC Cumberland, MD Erwin, TN Curtis Bay (Baltimore), MD Nashville, TN Locust Point (Baltimore), MD Richmond, VA For a list of Intermodal’s terminals, see page 18. Network Geography CSXT’s rail operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in nine eastern states with industrial areas in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. Coal is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the United States. CSXT’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast. Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the southeast. The corridor provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the increasing demand for coal in the southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT well to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, coal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. 15 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route”, has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent, high-speed intermodal, automotive and merchandise service. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest. Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of Washington, D.C., and provides access to all the major eastern ports. Locomotives CSXT focuses on maximum use of its fleet and prudent investment in new units to drive the rail network. Better locomotive management can help CSXT move freight more efficiently, while continued investment in CSXT’s power source can enable CSXT to operate more locomotives better. CSXT operates more than 4,000 locomotives, of which over 95% are owned by CSXT. Freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull rail cars. Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar gets attached to the right train in order to get it to its final destination. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. At December 2008, CSXT’s fleet of owned and long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following types of locomotives: Locomotives % Freight 3,600 87% Switching 322 8% Auxiliary Units 221 5% Total 4,143 100% 16 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I The table below indicates the number and year built for locomotives owned or on long-term lease at December 2008. Year Built Locomotives % 1989 and before 2,021 50% 1990 - 1994 541 13% 1995 - 1999 601 15% 2000 - 2004 380 9% 2005 100 2% 2006 100 2% 2007 184 4% 2008 216 5% Total 4,143 100% Freight Car Fleet The average daily fleet of cars-on-line consists of approximately 224,000 cars, but at any point in time, over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by CSXT. Examples of these are: railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service) and multi-level railcars. CSXT’s freight car fleet consists of six main types of cars: Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel. Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions. Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine. Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers. Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles. Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood. 17 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Other cars owned or leased on the network include, but are not limited to, center beam cars for transporting lumber and building products. CSXT owns more than 60% of its freight cars. At December 2008, CSXT’s owned and long-term leased freight car fleet consisted of the following: Freight Cars % Gondolas 26,377 29% Open-top hoppers 18,760 21% Box cars 13,198 14% Covered hoppers 12,915 14% Multi-level flat cars 11,772 13% Flat cars 7,195 8% Other cars 1,133 1% Total 91,350 100% Intermodal Property Infrastructure Intermodal serves 56 terminals in 22 states.

Containers are weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight, and chassis are the wheeled support framework for a container that allows it to be attached to a tractor. All of Intermodal’s chassis are leased. Intermodal also has other types of equipment such as doublestack railcars, which are railcars that allow for two containers to be mounted one above the other. At December 2008, Intermodal owned or long-term leased equipment consisted of the following: Equipment % Containers 14,577 52% Chassis 13,060 47% Other 426 2% Total 28,063 100% Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. For more information on legal proceedings, see Item 7.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17, Business Segments. 8 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company’s forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company’s earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices. Legislation passed by Congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company’s business. For instance, legislation proposed in the Senate in December 2009, if adopted, would significantly change the federal regulatory framework of the railroad industry. Several of the changes under consideration could have a significant negative impact on the Company’s ability to determine prices for rail services, meet service standards and would likely force a reduction in capital spending. Statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company’s profitability. Also, additional regulations related to environmental matters such as greenhouse gas emissions could increase the Company’s operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies or negatively impact the business of CSX customers. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company’s operations and financial results. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, the FRA and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company’s operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies. For example, the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (“RSIA”) imposes limits on employee work hours and may result in higher operating costs for the Company. The RSIA also mandated the installation by December 31, 2015 of Positive Train Control (PTC) on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. The FRA issued its final rule in January 2010 on the design, operational requirements and implementation of the new technology. The final rule is expected to impose significant new costs on CSX and the rail industry. Noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. 9 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Climate change legislation and regulation could adversely affect the Company’s operations and financial results. Regulation or legislation that potentially imposes restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gas could adversely affect operations and financial results. More specifically, increased energy costs resulting from legislative or regulatory actions could adversely impact CSX by: (1) making it difficult for CSX’s customers in the U.S. to produce products in a cost competitive manner (particularly in the absence of similar regulations in countries like India and China); (2) increasing CSX’s fuel costs and hurting fuel efficiency; and (3) reducing the consumption of coal as an energy resource in the United States. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of traffic handled and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation. A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation. Such claims could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems, and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could result in increased operating costs, reduced operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials. 10 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs. The Company’s operations are subject to wide-ranging federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, discharges into water, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and clean-up of hazardous material or petroleum releases. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned and used by the Company. The Company has been, and may be subject to, allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company’s incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. General economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight. The current economic environment has adversely affected demand for rail and intermodal services. Further decline in general domestic and global economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities the Company carries could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects. Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital. The Company is in a capital intensive industry that requires continuing infrastructure improvements and acquisition of capital assets. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. Adverse conditions in the credit markets could increase the Company’s costs associated with issuing debt, limit the Company’s ability to sell debt securities on acceptable terms and impede the Company’s ability to revise its current debt arrangements as contemplated. 11 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Network congestion could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency. CSXT may experience rail network difficulties related to increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas or regulatory changes impacting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes that could have a negative effect on CSXT’s operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency. The Company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business. The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. A significant disruption or failure of the Company’s information technology systems, including computer hardware, software and communications equipment, could result in a service interruption, safety failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. The performance and reliability of the Company’s technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. Disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs. The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping, or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT’s operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted. Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSXT's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Generally speaking, these agreements are bargained nationally by the National Carriers Committee. In the rail industry, negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. If CSXT is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, however, it could result in strikes by the affected workers, loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. Under the Railway Labor Act’s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of Presidential intervention), neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. 12 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I The Company faces competition from other transportation providers. The Company experiences competition in the form of pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks using largely internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company’s competitive position. Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company’s operations. Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT’s rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these regulations could continue to increase the Company’s operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies. Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage. The Company’s operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company’s rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company’s damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations. 13 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I The Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. The Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits, including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Additionally, existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company’s reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company’s control. While the Company uses its best efforts to evaluate existing litigation, the final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves. Increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company faces inherent business risk from exposure to occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, including storm damage, and claims related to train accidents. The Company may incur significant costs to defend such claims. Existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company’s control. Although the Company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the Company’s insurance coverage. 14 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties by Segment Rail Property CSXT’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars. These categories and the geography of the network are described below. Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern cities of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago. CSXT’s track structure includes main thoroughfares, connecting terminals and yards (known as mainline track), track within terminals and switching yards, track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains, track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles are greater than CSXT’s approximately 21,000 route miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s rail network that connects markets, customers and western railroads. At December 2009, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track Miles Mainline track 26,743 Terminals and switching yards 9,578 Passing sidings and turnouts 958 Total 37,279 In addition to its physical track structure, CSXT operates numerous yards and terminals. These serve as the hubs between CSXT and its local customers and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received, re-sorted and placed onto new outbound trains. 15 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I The following 36 terminals are identified as key to the CSXT system (listed in alphabetical order by state): Rail Yards or Terminals Birmingham, AL Detroit, MI Mobile, AL Hamlet, NC Montgomery, AL Rocky Mount, NC Moncrief (Jacksonville), FL Buffalo, NY Tampa, FL Selkirk, NY Atlanta, GA Syracuse, NY East Savannah, GA Cincinnati, OH Waycross, GA Cleveland, OH Chicago, IL Columbus, OH Danville, IL Stanley (Toledo), OH Avon (Indianapolis), IN Walbridge (Toledo), OH Evansville, IN Willard, OH Louisville, KY Greenwich (Philadelphia), PA Russell, KY Charleston, SC New Orleans, LA Florence, SC Cumberland, MD Erwin, TN Curtis Bay (Baltimore), MD Nashville, TN Locust Point (Baltimore), MD Richmond, VA For a list of Intermodal’s terminals, see page 21. 16 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Network Geography CSXT’s rail operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian region with industrial areas in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. Coal is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the United States. CSXT’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast. Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route”, has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track).

As volume returns, these locomotives will be placed back into service after restorative maintenance procedures are performed. These locomotives can be brought back into service within a week. Freight Car Fleet The average daily fleet of cars-on-line consists of approximately 216,000 cars but, at any time, over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by CSXT. Examples of these are: railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service) and multi-level railcars. 19 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I CSXT’s freight car fleet consists of six main types of cars: Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities.

Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 6Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART INew legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices. Legislation passed by Congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business. For instance, legislation proposed in the Senate in December 2009, and reintroduced in January 2011 (see Regulatory Environment in Part I for further details), if adopted, could significantly change the federal regulatory framework of the railroad industry.

In addition, statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, the FRA and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies. For example, the RSIA mandated that the installation of PTC be completed by December 31, 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. In January 2010, the FRA issued its final rule on the design, operational requirements and implementation of the new PTC technology. The FRA is now re-examining certain aspects of the rule in response to rail industry concerns. The AAR recently advised the FRA on behalf of the industry that a nationwide interoperable PTC network cannot be completed by the December 31, 2015 deadline. Federal legislation introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would, if approved, delay the final implementation of PTC from three to five years. Even if revised, the rule will continue to impose significant new costs on the Company and the rail industry. Noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. Climate change legislation and regulation could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. Climate change legislation or regulation has been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. In particular, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has issued various regulations targeting GHG emissions, including rules and standards governing GHG emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect CSX operations and financial results by, among other things: (1) increasing energy costs generally, making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner (particularly in the absence of similar regulations in countries like India and China); (2) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; (3) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards which CSX considers to be unachievable within the time frames ordered by the U.S. EPA, and (4) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of traffic the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 7Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ICapacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency. CSXT may experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased passenger activities, including high-speed rail, in capacity-constrained areas, or (ii) regulatory changes impacting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes that could have a negative effect on CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency. General economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight. The economic recession in late 2008 and 2009 adversely affected demand for rail and intermodal services. Although overall traffic improved in 2010 and 2011, a decline in general domestic and global economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities the Company carries could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects. In addition, if the rate of economic growth in China slows or if European economies contract, U.S. export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for CSX. Furthermore, sustained low natural gas prices are having a negative impact on domestic coal volume, as coal-fired electricity generation is being displaced by natural gas-fired generation, which could adversely impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation. A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems, and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials. The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water, the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials, the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases, and the health and safety of our employees. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which we are responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company. 8Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company has been, and may in the future, be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. The Company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business. The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. Such an event could result in increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. Disruption of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.Disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs. The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), other production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports, adverse political developments or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted. Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The majority of these agreements are bargained nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of Presidential intervention), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, or if terms of existing agreements are disputed, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. 9Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART I The Company faces competition from other transportation providers. The Company experiences competition in the form of pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations. Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage. The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations. The Company may be subject to lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. The Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits, including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Additionally, existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company's control. Final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves.10Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIncreases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the Company's operating results. The Company faces inherent business risk from exposure to occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, including storm damage, and claims related to train accidents. The Company may incur significant costs to defend such claims. Existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company's control. Although the Company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the Company's insurance coverage.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2. Properties The Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern cities of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.11Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ICSXT’s track structure includes main thoroughfares, connecting terminals and yards (known as mainline track), track within terminals and switching yards, track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains, track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles are greater than CSXT’s approximately 21,000 route miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads. At December 2011, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track MilesMainline track26,546Terminals and switching yards9,556Passing sidings and turnouts910Total37,012In addition to its physical track structure, CSXT operates numerous yards and terminals. These serve as the hubs between CSXT and its local customers and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received, re-sorted and placed onto new outbound trains. The Company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume (number of rail cars or intermodal containers processed) are listed below:Yards and TerminalsAnnualVolume(number of units processed)Chicago, IL922,893Waycross, GA663,821Selkirk, NY584,746Willard, OH500,612Nashville, TN493,106Indianapolis, IN491,728Cincinnati, OH486,242Hamlet, NC462,247Toledo, OH361,871Birmingham, AL357,35312Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork Geography CSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent, high-speed intermodal, automotive and merchandise service. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries consumer goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, coal and intermodal.Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia, and provides access to major eastern ports.Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois Basin with industrial areas in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. CSXT’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for exports outside of the U.S. Roughly one of every three tons of export coal and nearly all of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity.See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network.13Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ICSX Rail Network14Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ILocomotives CSXT operates more than 4,000 locomotives, of which over 95% are owned by CSXT. Freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull trains. Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar is attached to the right train in order to deliver it to its final destination. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. At December 2011, CSXT’s fleet of owned and long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following types of locomotives: Locomotives % Average Age(years)Freight 3,579 87% 20Switching 322 8% 32Auxiliary Units 215 5% 19Total 4,116 100% 20 Equipment In 2011, the average daily fleet of cars on line consisted of approximately 206,000. At any time over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by the Company. Examples of these are as follows: railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service) and multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared among railroads). 15Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company’s equipment consists of freight cars, containers and chassis. Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions.Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine. Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers.Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles.Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.Containers - Weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight.Chassis - Wheeled support framework for a container that allows it to be attached to a tractor. All of the Company’s chassis are leased. Other cars owned or leased on the network include, but are not limited to, center beam cars for transporting lumber and building products. The Company also has other types of equipment such as doublestack railcars, which allow for two containers to be mounted one above the other. 16Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IAt December 2011, the Company’s owned and long-term leased equipment consisted of the following:Equipment Number of Units %Gondolas 25,337 37%Open-top hoppers 12,354 18%Box cars 8,659 13%Covered hoppers 10,987 16%Multi-level flat cars 9,845 14%Flat cars 1,106 2%Other cars 371 1%Subtotal freight cars 68,659 100%Containers 16,403 61%Chassis 10,360 39%Subtotal equipment 26,763 100%Total equipment 95,422 Item 3. Legal ProceedingsFuel Surcharge Antitrust LitigationClass action lawsuits first filed in May 2007 have been consolidated and are pending in federal court in the District of Columbia against CSXT and three other U.S.-based Class I railroads. The court has not yet ruled on whether it is appropriate to certify the case as a class action. The lawsuits contain substantially similar allegations to the effect that the defendants' fuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws. The suits seek unquantified treble damages (three times the amount of actual damages) allegedly sustained by purported class members, attorneys' fees and other relief. All but three of the lawsuits purport to be filed on behalf of a class of shippers that allegedly purchased rail freight transportation services from the defendants through the use of contracts or through other means exempt from rate regulation during defined periods commencing as early as June 2003 and that were assessed fuel surcharges. Three of the lawsuits purport to be on behalf of indirect purchasers of rail services. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the direct purchasers' claims. The court dismissed all of the indirect purchasers' causes of action seeking money damages, but did not dismiss their request for injunctive relief. The dismissal was upheld on appeal. Plaintiffs then petitioned the United States Supreme Court to hear the case. The Supreme Court denied the petition in December 2010. One additional lawsuit was filed, but not served, by an individual shipper. CSXT entered into a tolling agreement with this shipper whereby the shipper agreed to dismiss the lawsuit against CSXT without prejudice and CSXT agreed to extend the statute of limitations for the claims asserted until the end of 2010. That agreement has been extended to the end of 2012.17Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ICSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices are lawful. Accordingly, CSXT intends to vigorously defend itself against the purported class actions, which it believes are without merit. While CSXT cannot predict the outcome of the private lawsuits, or of any government investigations, charges or additional litigation that may be filed in the future, we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Penalties for violating antitrust laws can be severe, involving both potential criminal and civil liability. If a material adverse outcome were to occur and be sustained, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Other Legal Proceedings In addition to the matters described above, the Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including, but not limited to, those related to environmental and hazardous material exposure matters, FELA claims by employees, other personal injury claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are purported to be, class actions. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering, among other things, the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance, it is currently the opinion of CSX management that none of these pending items will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period.Item 4.

CSX purchases its own shares for two primary reasons: to further its goals under its share repurchase program and to fund the Company’s contribution required to be paid in CSX common stock under a 401(k) plan which covers certain union employees.In 2011, CSX repurchased a total of $1.6 billion of common stock, which includes $1.3 billion from the new share repurchase program announced in May 2011. As of December 30, 2011, the Company had remaining authority of $734 million under this new $2 billion program. The Company may purchase shares from time to time on the open market, through block trades or otherwise. CSX did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter of 2011, and as such, no table showing shares repurchased in the quarter is required. CSX expects to complete the remaining repurchase amount by the end of 2012 based on market and business conditions. Since year end, the Company has completed $178 million of additional share repurchases through a trade date of February 15, 2012. 23Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II Item 6.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSTRATEGIC OVERVIEW CSX provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers. The Company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the economic success and global competitiveness of the United States. America is once again poised for a period of growth in manufacturing, as the economy continues to recover. The U.S. demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise along with the need to reduce highway congestion and greenhouse gas emissions. CSX and freight railroads are the best way to meet this demand while reducing environmental impacts. CSX can move a ton of freight almost 500 miles on one gallon of fuel and, on average, over three times more fuel efficiently than trucks. CSX's network is positioned to reach nearly two-thirds of Americans, who account for the majority of the nation's consumption of goods. Through this network, the Company transports a diverse portfolio of products and commodities to meet the country's needs. These products range from energy sources like coal and ethanol, to automobiles, chemicals, building materials, paper, metals, grains and consumer products. The Company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business: merchandise, coal and intermodal. CSX's transportation solutions connect industries across the United States with each other and with global markets to meet the transportation needs of port facilities, energy producers, manufacturers, industrial producers, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers and the United States armed forces. CSX services are delivered by dedicated employees whose jobs cannot be exported overseas. Railroad jobs are among some of the nation's highest paying. In 2011, CSX continued its job creation efforts by hiring more than 4,000 new employees that will carry forward with this legacy.Strategic Growth InitiativesAs CSX continues to strengthen its core business, the Company is focusing on three key strategic growth initiatives related to intermodal, export coal and total service integration. The Company believes these initiatives will allow it to capture additional domestic and international volume, while improving service offerings to its customers in a cost-effective manner. The Company's intermodal business is an economical, environmentally-friendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck. CSX is capitalizing on this opportunity by building new terminals and increasing network capacity. Construction of a new intermodal terminal in Louisville, Kentucky and major terminal expansion projects such as the Worcester, Massachusetts and Columbus, Ohio terminals are currently underway. These investments are in addition to the Company's new Northwest Ohio intermodal terminal that became operational during first quarter 2011. This high-capacity terminal, which is part of CSX's National Gateway initiative discussed below, expands service offerings to customers as well as improves market access to and from east coast ports. Rapid economic growth in developing countries such as India, China and Brazil has generated a long term growth cycle in export coal demand. As a result of the increase in global steel production, demand for U.S. coal is expected to remain strong. Demand for coal used in electric power generation is also expected to remain high due to rising consumption as developing countries become more urbanized. These increases in global coal demand are expected to largely be met by export shipments with a considerable portion originating from the U.S. The Company is well-positioned to capitalize on this market growth through its network access to large U.S. coal suppliers and multiple port facilities. 25Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICSX's Total Service Integration (“TSI”) initiative, which was launched in 2006, supports growth by improving service, optimizing train size, and increasing asset utilization for unit train shipments from origin to destination. CSX is now advancing this initiative to enhance service quality for customers who ship by the carload. This program, TSI Carload, focuses where the customer is impacted most - during the first and last mile of service. These enhancements aim to improve service levels and reliability of rail transportation over other modes of transportation. These improvements to operational processes, customer communication and service will better align the Company's operating capabilities with customers' needs. Balanced Approach to Capital DeploymentCSX remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying capital that includes investments in infrastructure, dividend growth and share repurchases. In 2011, the Company invested $2.3 billion to further enhance the capacity, quality, safety and flexibility of its network. Included in this amount is approximately $100 million of investments related to reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year. In addition, CSX continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend nine times over the last six year period which represents a 36 percent compounded annual growth rate. Also during 2011, CSX announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authority expected to be completed by the end of 2012 based on market and business conditions.Public-Private PartnershipsExpanding capacity on U.S. rail networks will provide substantial public benefits including job creation, increased business activity at U.S. ports, reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions. Therefore, CSX and its government partners are working jointly to invest in multi-year rail infrastructure projects such as the National Gateway. This initiative is a public-private partnership which will increase intermodal capacity on key corridors between Mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest. Current projects related to the National Gateway include the expansion of the Virginia Avenue Tunnel in Washington, D.C. and construction for double-stack train clearances in Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and the District of Columbia.CSX is engaged in another major partnership initiative with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to expand freight and commuter rail service. Currently, CSX provides service to and from New England. To further improve that service offering to customers, CSX is expanding its intermodal terminal footprint in Worcester, Massachusetts and, with the Commonwealth, is clearing the route from Worcester to the New York state line for double-stack intermodal service. Additionally, CSX has entered into a transaction with the state of Florida to help alleviate highway congestion through a new commuter rail operation known as SunRail. CSX sold the state a portion of its track for its new commuter rail and will invest the proceeds in additional freight rail capacity and infrastructure within the state. This includes a new automotive and intermodal facility in central Florida. In summary, these long-term investments discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth and productivity improvement, enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations. To continue these types of investments, the Company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value. CSX will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the Company's rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies.26Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II2011 HIGHLIGHTS•Revenue increased $1.1 billion or 10% to $11.7 billion primarily driven by pricing above inflation and higher fuel recoveries.•Expenses increased $760 million or 10% to $8.3 billion driven primarily by higher fuel prices and inflation. •Operating income increased $347 million or 11% to an all-time annual record of $3.4 billion and operating ratio improved to 70.9%, also an all-time annual record.

Revenue increased 10% from prior year, to $11.7 billion, with growth in all three major markets - merchandise, coal and intermodal. Ongoing emphasis on pricing above rail inflation, along with higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices, drove revenue-per-unit increases in all markets.Expenses increased by $760 million, or 10%, from prior year. This increase was driven primarily by higher fuel prices, inflation and other labor-related costs associated with increased resource levels and training costs focused on service improvements. Although expenses increased year-over-year, CSX was able to achieve a record operating ratio of 70.9% due to the Company's continued focus on cost control and strong top line growth. Fiscal year 2010 results include an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year 2011. This activity did not have a material impact on the Company's full year 2010 results of operations. For additional information, refer to Results of Operations discussed on pages 34 through 37.27Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIIn addition to the financial highlights described above, the Company measures and reports safety and service performance. The Company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training, initiatives and investment. For example, the Company's safety and train accident prevention programs rely on broad employee involvement. The programs utilize operating rules training, compliance measurement, root cause analysis and communication that are intended to create a safer environment for employees and the public. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.The Company routinely collaborates with the FRA and industry organizations as well as federal, state and local governments on the development and implementation of safety programs and initiatives. For example, CSX, Operation Lifesaver, Inc., the U.S. Department of Transportation and other major railroads from across the country have partnered in the Common Sense campaign to reduce the number of injuries and deaths around tracks and trains. In addition to these initiatives, CSXT also has an ongoing public safety program to clear-cut trees and vegetation at public passive highway-rail intersections (crossings with no flashing lights or gates) to improve the public's ability to discern rail hazards. During 2011, the Company's safety metrics improved. For 2011, the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) personal injury rate improved 10% to 0.91, compared to 1.01 in 2010. This is a record full year personal injury performance for CSX. The 2011 reported FRA train accident frequency rate improved 14% to 2.32, compared to 2.69 in 2010. These improvements were achieved through a sustained commitment to safety.Key service measures in 2011 slightly declined as the impact of severe weather on first half 2011 operations were partially offset by improvements gained from additional resources added in the second half of 2011. On-time train originations declined to 72% from 75% in 2010 while on-time arrivals declined to 62% from 69% in 2010. Dwell time increased to 25.9 hours from 25.0 hours in 2010. Average train velocity declined 2% to 20.6 miles per hour. While these key measures declined on a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter 2011 measures were markedly improved, and continue to support efficient and reliable train operations for CSX's customers. 28Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIOperating Statistics (Estimated) Fiscal Years Improvement/ 2011 2010 (Decline)Safety and FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index0.91 1.01 10 %ServiceMeasurements FRA Train Accident Rate2.32 2.69 14 % On-Time Train Originations72% 75% (4)% On-Time Destination Arrivals62% 69% (10)% Dwell25.9 25.0 (4)% Cars-On-Line206,432 210,984 2 % Train Velocity20.6 21.0 (2)% Increase/ (Decrease)Resources Route Miles20,998 21,084 — % Locomotives (owned and long-term leased)4,116 4,072 1 % Freight Cars (owned and long-term leased)68,659 70,318 (2)%DefinitionsFRA Personal Injury Frequency Index – Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours.FRA Train Accident Rate – Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.On-Time Train Originations – Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.On-Time Destination Arrivals – Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to two hours late (30 minutes for intermodal trains).Dwell – Average amount of time in hours between car arrival at and departure from the yard.

Management believes that free cash flow is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. As described below, free cash flow before dividends decreased $94 million to $1.4 billion.The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure).

These investments of approximately $100 million in 2011 are projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. Also, property additions for 2009 above do not include cash payments of new assets using seller financing of approximately $160 million. These payments are shown in ""other financing activities"" on the consolidated cash flow statement.30Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the SEC, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements.

This adjustment is presented in intermodal revenue above and is considered immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.34Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II2011 vs. 2010 Results of Operations CSX full year results reflect positive year-over-year volume and revenue growth as demand for rail service in the markets CSX serves continued to support profitable growth. Ongoing emphasis on pricing above rail inflation, along with higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices, drove revenue-per-unit increases in all markets. Fiscal year 2010 results include an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year 2011. Volume and Revenue Merchandise AgriculturalAgricultural Products – Volume declined as the amount of feed shipments declined as a result of higher corn prices and decreased production from producers of poultry and pork. These reductions were slightly offset by growth in ethanol and increased shipments of soybeans into the Southeast due to low inventories. Phosphates and Fertilizers – Shipments of domestic fertilizers grew as farmers replenished inventories to improve crop yields as a result of higher anticipated crop prices. Export demand was also strong with recovery in exports to Central and South America after last year's drought. Shipments of phosphate rock, which is used to make fertilizer, grew as suppliers are stocking up in anticipation of a strong spring season.Food and Consumer – Volume decreased as lower appliance shipments resulting from continued weakness in the housing sector was partially offset by strength in truckload conversions of refrigerated products and manufactured goods.IndustrialChemicals – Volume was flat as strength in frac sand (used in the extraction of gas and petroleum) resulted from the increase in natural gas drilling. This increase was offset by a reduction in basic chemical markets, like plastics, which experienced weak consumer demand and inventory destocking.Automotive - Automotive volume grew as North American automotive production increased to meet pent up demand from delayed purchases during the slowed economy over the last few years.Metals – Volume growth was driven by strong export demand for scrap shipments and higher domestic steel production resulting from strong demand in the automotive and oil and gas sectors for products such as sheet steel and pipe.Housing and ConstructionEmerging Markets – Volume increased primarily driven by improved shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel), cement and waste (such as construction and demolition debris) as a result of new distribution facilities and overall market growth related to the improving economy. Forest Products – Volume increased, despite the weakness in housing-related markets, primarily related to strength in shipments of pulp board and paper used in packaging for consumer products and increased shipments of building products resulting from inventory replenishments.35Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICoalShipments of utility coal declined as electrical generation declined in the eastern U.S., natural gas prices remained low and utility stockpiles were above target levels. This decrease was partially offset by higher export shipments driven by greater demand for U.S. coal in Europe, South America and Asia. During 2011, CSX shipped 40.2 million tons of export coal. The increase in revenue per unit was driven by improved yield, positive mix and fuel recovery. Intermodal International and domestic shipment growth resulted from expanded service offerings, over-the-road conversions, and service and network enhancements. The increase in revenue per unit was driven by increased fuel recovery, improved yields and favorable traffic mix. This revenue-per-unit increase was partially offset by the impact of switching from a purchased transportation arrangement to a domestic interline program in the prior year. This program, known as UMAX, provides customers with containers for local shipments or transcontinental service provided jointly by CSX and Union Pacific Corporation.Other Other revenue increased due to stronger affiliate revenue and higher incidental charges mostly offset by lower benefits for contract volume commitments as compared to the prior year. ExpenseIn 2011, total expenses increased $760 million or 10% to $8.3 billion compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $116 million primarily driven by inflation, increased resource levels and other labor-related costs associated with training focused on service improvements partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities. This category also includes costs related to casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, utilities, property and sales taxes and professional services. In addition, this category includes amounts paid to other transportation companies. Total materials, supplies and other expense increased by $154 million in 2011. The increase was primarily driven by the following:•Volume-related expenses and inflation increased as a result of higher operating and maintenance costs at automotive facilities, coal piers and intermodal terminals. Additionally, maintenance expense increased due to a higher active count of locomotives in service as compared to prior year. Higher travel costs for train crews and other volume-related expenses also contributed to this increase. •Casualty expenses increased year-over-year primarily due to the prior year benefit of $49 million not repeated in the current year. This benefit was a result of improvements in safety and occupational claim trends.36Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II•Expense increases were partially offset by approximately $37 million of reduced transportation costs as a result of switching from a purchased transportation agreement to the UMAX domestic interline program in 2010. Additionally, an operating property transaction with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts closed during 2010 and resulted in a $30 million net book loss on a pre-tax basis. Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $456 million primarily due to a 26% increase in average price per gallon for locomotive fuel. Average fuel price per gallon increased $0.80 from $2.26 in 2010 to $3.06 in 2011.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $29 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending partially offset by a multi-year adjustment related to retirements as well as the impact of prior year's additional expense related to the extra week.Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses increased $5 million primarily due to volume-related expenses partially offset by cost savings associated with improved asset utilization. OtherInterest ExpenseInterest expense decreased $5 million to $552 million primarily due to lower average interest rates offset by higher average debt balances during 2011.Other Income – NetOther income - net decreased $10 million to $22 million related to lower real estate sales and increased non-operating expenses.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased $83 million to $1.1 billion due to higher earnings during 2011 offset by certain state income tax related adjustments compared to a year ago.Net EarningsNet earnings increased $259 million to $1.8 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $0.32 to $1.67 in 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income net of income taxes in 2011.37Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II2010 vs. 2009 Results of Operations Fiscal Years 2010 2009 $ Change % Change(Dollars in Millions) Revenue $10,636 $9,041 $1,595 18 %Expense Labor and Fringe 2,957 2,629 (328) (12)Materials, Supplies and Other 2,075 1,999 (76) (4)Fuel 1,212 849 (363) (43)Depreciation 947 903 (44) (5)Equipment and Other Rents 374 391 17 4Total Expense 7,565 6,771 (794) (12)Operating Income $3,071 $2,270 $801 35Interest Expense (557) (558) 1 —Other Income - Net 32 34 2 6Income Tax Expense (983) (618) (365) (59)Earnings From Continuing Operations 1,563 1,128 435 39Discontinued Operations — 15 (15) (100)Net Earnings $1,563 $1,143 $420 37Earnings Per Diluted Share: Continuing Operations $1.35 $0.95 $0.40 42Discontinued Operations — 0.01 (0.01) (100)Net Earnings $1.35 $0.96 $0.39 41 %Operating Ratio 71.1% 74.9% 380 bpsVolume and Revenue (Unaudited)Volume (Thousands of units); Revenue (Dollars in Millions); Revenue Per Unit (Dollars)Fiscal Years (a) Volume Revenue Revenue Per Unit 2010 2009 % Change 2010 2009 % Change 2010 2009 % ChangeAgricultural Agricultural Products 446 428 4% $1,056 $960 10% $2,368 $2,243 6 %Phosphates and Fertilizers 313 289 8 465 373 25 1,486 1,291 15Food and Consumer 102 100 2 245 233 5 2,402 2,330 3Industrial Chemicals 461 424 9 1,485 1,267 17 3,221 2,988 8Automotive 340 234 45 800 511 57 2,353 2,184 8Metals 243 200 22 520 399 30 2,140 1,995 7Housing and Construction Emerging Markets 418 405 3 615 585 5 1,471 1,444 2Forest Products 265 258 3 600 547 10 2,264 2,120 7Total Merchandise 2,588 2,338 11 5,786 4,875 19 2,236 2,085 7Coal 1,573 1,553 1 3,267 2,727 20 2,077 1,756 18Intermodal(b) 2,223 1,902 17 1,291 1,184 9 581 623 (7)Other — — — 292 255 15 — — —Total 6,384 5,793 10% $10,636 $9,041 18% $1,666 $1,561 7 %(a) CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar and 2010 included 53 weeks. The revenue impact for the extra week was $171 million.(b) The revenue-per-unit decline was primarily driven by the continued impact of terminating the prior purchased transportation agreement. See the explanation for intermodal variances for further information.38Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II2010 vs. 2009 Results of OperationsCSX full year results reflect continued strong year-over-year volume and revenue growth as a result of the improving economy. Ongoing emphasis on pricing above rail inflation, along with higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices, drove revenue-per-unit increases in most markets. Fiscal year 2010 results include an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year 2009. Volume and Revenue Merchandise AgriculturalAgricultural Products – Volume grew with increased shipments of feed grains and ethanol. Shipments of feed grains improved with expanded meat production and lower wheat imports. Ethanol shipments grew as the amount of ethanol in fuel continued to increase.Phosphates and Fertilizers – Volume increased as a result of strength in demand for domestic fertilizers due to a strong planting season and due to replenishment of low inventories.Food and Consumer – Volume increased slightly as strength in refrigerated products, primarily fruits and vegetables, and alcoholic beverages were partially offset by weakness in demand for appliances.IndustrialChemicals – Growth occurred across most markets reflecting improvement in demand for intermediate products used in manufacturing automobiles and consumer goods. Many plastics and chemicals are key inputs in the production of both durable and nondurable goods, as well as packaging.Automotive – Strong growth was driven by an increase in North American light-vehicle production in response to increased demand in the improving economy. Metals – Volume growth was driven by increased shipments of sheet steel for auto production, increases in scrap steel resulting from higher steel production and increases in energy-related products.Housing and ConstructionEmerging Markets – Shipments increased in limestone, transportation equipment and aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) as a result of overall market growth due to the improving economy.Forest Products – Volume increased with strength in shipments of pulp board and paper used in packaging for consumer products. Volume also increased slightly in construction-related markets. 39Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICoalVolume was basically flat as increased export shipments were offset by weakness in utility shipments. Higher export shipments were due to greater demand for U.S. metallurgical coal in Asia and steam coal in Europe. Shipments to utility customers were down as high utility stockpiles were reduced throughout the year and are approaching targeted levels. The increase in revenue per unit was driven by improved yield, higher fuel recovery and longer length of haul. Intermodal International and domestic shipment growth resulted from U.S. inventory replenishment, improved U.S. exports, new business, truckload conversions, and new UMAX and door-to-door service offerings.The revenue-per-unit decline was driven by the impact of switching from a purchased transportation arrangement to a domestic interline program at the start of second quarter. This program, known as UMAX, provides customers with containers for local shipments or transcontinental service provided jointly by CSX and Union Pacific Corporation. This revenue-per-unit decline was partly offset by increased fuel recovery and an improved pricing environment.Other Revenue gains were primarily driven by benefits for contract volume commitments not met.ExpenseTotal expenses for 2010 increased 12% or $794 million to $7.6 billion compared to the prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $328 million primarily driven by inflation and higher incentive compensation. Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities. This category also includes costs related to casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, utilities, property and sales taxes and professional services. In addition, this category includes amounts paid to other transportation companies. Total materials, supplies and other expense increased by $76 million in 2010. This increase was primarily driven by the following:•Volume increases drove higher operating and maintenance costs at automotive facilities, coal piers and intermodal terminals. In addition, maintenance expenses increased as locomotives previously held in storage during 2009 due to lower volume were placed back into service during 2010. Higher travel costs for train crews and other volume-related expenses also contributed to this increase.•As safety and occupational claim trends have continued to improve, changes in estimate were recorded in both years - $49 million in 2010 and $105 million in 2009. This resulted in a year-over-year increase in casualty expense of $56 million.•An operating property transaction with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts closed during 2010 and resulted in a $30 million net book loss on a pre-tax basis. This property is a former Conrail-acquired property. The Company received $50 million of cash related to this transaction.40Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II•The above increases to expense were offset by $126 million of reduced purchased transportation costs as a result of switching from a purchased transportation agreement to the UMAX domestic interline program during 2010 in the intermodal business.Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $363 million primarily due to higher fuel prices and higher volume. Average fuel price per gallon increased $0.55 or 32% from $1.71 in 2009 to $2.26 in 2010.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $44 million in 2010 primarily due to a larger asset base.Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $17 million primarily due to cost savings associated with improved asset utilization and lower lease expense, partially offset by volume-related increases.OtherInterest ExpenseInterest expense decreased $1 million to $557 million primarily due to lower average debt balances during 2010.Other Income – NetOther income decreased $2 million to $32 million primarily related to lower interest income caused by lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates in 2010.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased $365 million to $983 million primarily due to higher earnings during 2010.Net EarningsNet earnings increased $420 million to $1.6 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $0.39 to $1.35 in 2010. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income net of income taxes in 2010.41Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IILIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to implement regulatory and legislative initiatives. In order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed.Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash FlowsConsolidated Balance SheetsCSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend improvement and share repurchases.Total assets increased $1.3 billion from prior year. Assets increased primarily due to the increase in net properties of $1.2 billion from planned capital spending as well as short-term investments grew $469 million. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in cash of $509 million.Total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined increased $1.3 billion primarily due to the net increase in total debt of $577 million mostly due to additional borrowings. Deferred income tax liability also increased by $548 million primarily related to the net impact of bonus depreciation on tax accruals. Shareholders' equity decreased by $232 million as a result of $1.6 billion of share repurchases since December 2010 partially offset by increased earnings during 2011.Sources of CashThe Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2011, the Company generated $3.5 billion of cash from operating activities which represented a $230 million increase from prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in 2011. Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in September 2016. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information.CSX filed its shelf registration statement with the SEC in February 2010. This shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.42Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIUses of CashCSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2011, net cash used in investing activities was driven by $2.3 billion of property additions which increased $457 million from prior year. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below. Fiscal YearsCapital Expenditures (Dollars in Millions) 2011 2010 2009Track $785 $777 $748Bridges, Signals and Other 421 475 363Total Infrastructure 1,206 1,252 1,111Freight Cars 373 157 71Capacity and Commercial Facilities 264 258 169Regulatory (including PTC) 210 133 57Locomotives 142 25 19Public-Private Partnerships - net (a) 102 15 (1)Total Property Additions 2,297 1,840 1,426Cash paid for new assets using seller financing (b) — — 160Total Capital Expenditures (a) $2,297 $1,840 $1,586(a)Total capital expenditures shown above include investments related to reimbursable public-private partnerships. These investments of approximately $100 million in 2011 are projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. (b)Cash paid for new assets purchased using seller financing shown above in 2009 was for locomotives and freight cars and are included in “other financing activities” on the consolidated cash flow statement.In addition to capital investments, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases and to pay dividends to shareholders. CSX paid dividends of $480 million in 2011, which was $108 million more than prior year. This increase was due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.09 per share at the beginning of 2011 and then to $0.12 in second quarter 2011. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion which increased $186 million primarily as a result of $1.6 billion of share repurchases partially offset by net debt in 2011.CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations. Although new legislation or regulations, such as the STB Reauthorization Bill or climate change legislation, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K), it is too early to predict the manner or severity of such impact. 43Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IILiquidity and Working CapitalCurrently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with over $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX also replaced its existing credit facility that was set to expire in May 2012 with a new $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility expires in September 2016. The Company has no outstanding balances under this facility as of the date of this filing. Additionally in 2011, CSX issued a total of $1.2 billion of new long-term debt. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, improvements in productivity, dividends to shareholders, debt repayments and repurchases of CSX common stock. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements. The Company's $250 million receivables securitization facility has a 364-day term and expires in December 2012. The Company plans to renew this facility prior to its expiration. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. Under the terms of this facility, CSXT transfers eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX services the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. In the event CSX Trade Receivables draws under this facility, the Company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements.Working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $248 million and $318 million at December 2011 and 2010, respectively. This lower surplus since the prior year is primarily due to a deferred gain included in current liabilities. See sources and uses of cash description above.The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.Credit Ratings Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.Currently, CSX is rated BBB with a stable outlook by S&P and Baa3 with a positive outlook by Moody's. Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.44Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IISCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTSThe following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other commitments: Type of Obligation20122013201420152016ThereafterTotal(Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations Total Debt (See Note 9)$507$780$527$628$23$6,776$9,241Interest on Debt5525194824334125,0407,438Purchase Obligations (See Note 7)8283573363222972,4884,628Operating Leases - Net (See Note 7) (a)6541582523155367Agreements with Conrail (a)12211—7Total Contractual Obligations$1,953$1,699$1,405$1,409$756$14,459$21,681Other Commitments(b)$170—————$170(a)Agreements with Conrail represent minimum future lease payments of $7 million for freight cars and locomotives (see Note 13, Related Party Transactions). This amount plus total operating leases-net of $367 million above equals total net lease commitments of $374 million disclosed in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.(b)Other commitments of $170 million consisted of surety bonds, letters of credit and uncertain tax positions. Surety bonds of $108 million and letters of credit of $40 million arise from assurances issued by a third-party that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement. Uncertain tax positions of $22 million which include interest and penalties are all included in year 2012. The year of settlement can not be reasonably estimated, however, the Company believes at least $4 million of these unrecognized tax benefits will be resolved in the next 12 months. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSFor detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.45Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:•casualty, environmental and legal reserves;•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and•income taxes Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves CasualtyCasualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury, occupational injury and asbestos claims. During 2010 the Company increased its self-insured retention amount for these claims from $25 million to $50 million per injury for claims occurring on or after June 1, 2010. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Company's self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC""), to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent third-party estimates, which are reviewed by management. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation.Most of the claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities.As of December 2011, the Company had $372 million in casualty reserves. See below for details regarding changes in estimate for casualty reserves.Personal Injury Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”). In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.46Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedCSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm quarterly and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience.During 2011, there were no significant changes in estimates in personal injury reserves. During 2010, the Company reduced personal injury reserves by $24 million due to a downward trend in the number of injuries. This downward trend was measured by the reduction of the CSXT's Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) personal injury rate. Adjustments to the reserves are included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.Occupational & AsbestosOccupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as “irritants”) and diesel fuels (from exhaust fumes) or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss.The Company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. Other types of exposures, however, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business. Diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods (amount of time between exposure to a disease and the onset of the disease) which can range from 10 to 40 years after exposure.Occupational and asbestos claims are analyzed by a third-party actuary or specialist (the ""third-party specialist""), respectively, in order to determine the number of unasserted or incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Analyses of both types of claims are performed by the third-party specialist and reviewed by management. This review is quarterly for occupational claims and annually for asbestos claims. Since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated, this review is completed annually. For asserted occupational and asbestos claims, management reviews quarterly. With the exception of carpal tunnel, management has determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which unasserted claim filings and claim values can be estimated. Carpal tunnel claims use a three-year period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries.The third-party specialists analyze CSXT’s historical claim filings, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for occupational and asbestos claims reserves. The potentially exposed population is estimated by using CSX employment records and industry data From this analysis, the third-party specialists provide an estimate of the IBNR claims liability.The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims.47Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedDuring 2011, there were no significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust occupational or asbestos reserves. During 2010, the Company reduced occupational reserves by $12 million primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of repetitive stress injury claims and lower settlement values for irritant claims. Also during 2010, the Company reduced its reserves for asbestos claims by $13 million, primarily related to a significant number of claims that were determined to have no value due to lack of sufficient medical evidence. Adjustments in reserves are included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.Environmental The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 246 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.In accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:•type of clean-up required;•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.48Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedAs of December 2011, the Company had $83 million in environmental reserves. These recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries. Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statement.Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations.LegalIn accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards.See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan AccountingThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. As of December 2011, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $2.7 billion. CSX did not make contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2011 or 2010.49Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedIn addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a self-insured post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Prior to 2011, the post-retirement medical plan was partially funded by all participating retirees, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. Beginning in 2011, Medicare-eligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Non-Medicare eligible retirees continue to be covered by the existing self-insured program. The life insurance plan is non-contributory.For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;•long-term rate of return on plan assets;•salary scale inflation rates;•health care cost trend rates; and•other assumptions.The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. The Company reviews the discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, salary scale inflation rates and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate.Discount Rates Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2011 pension and post-retirement obligations are 4.75% and 4.25%, respectively. For 2010, the discount rate used by the company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations was 5.0% and 4.5%, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2011, the estimated duration of pensions and post retirement benefits is approximately 11 years and 7 years, respectively.Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.50Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedLong-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its pension obligation was 8% and 8.25% in 2011 and 2010, respectively.Salary Scale Inflation Rates Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4% to value its 2011 and 2010 pension obligations.Health Care Cost Trend Rates Health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends. The Company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs, representing increases in total plan costs (which include claims and administrative fee cost components). The 2011 and 2010 assumed health care cost trend rate for benefit obligations was 8.5% for non-Medicare-eligible participants and 8% for Medicare-eligible participants which is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 5% in 2018, based upon current actuarial projections. However, the year-to-year comparisons may fluctuate.Other AssumptionsThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data and are selected by management.2012 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement ExpenseNet pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2012 is expected to be approximately $85 million and $28 million, respectively, compared to $73 million and $19 million, respectively, in 2011. The increase in the pension expense is primarily related to additional amortization of the losses incurred by the pension plan assets during 2011 and the decrease in the discount rate (which causes expense to increase), partially offset by the return on anticipated discretionary contributions.51Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedThe following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries and health care costs on the 2011 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:(Dollars in Millions) Pension OPEB Discount Rate 1% change $22 $1Long-term Rate of Return 1% change $18 N/ASalary Inflation 1% change $9 N/AHealth Care Cost 1% change N/A $—Depreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life MethodThe Company depreciates its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise over 85% of total fixed assets of $34 billion on a gross basis at December 2011. All other assets of the Company are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life.The Company currently utilizes more than 130 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method of accounting. Examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets. The Company believes the group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g., track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets.Under the group-life method of accounting, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying management's assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. A life study is the periodic review of asset lives for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires life studies be performed for equipment assets every three years and for road (e.g. bridges and signals) and track (e.g., rail, ties and ballast) assets every six years. The Company believes the frequency currently required by the STB provides adequate review of asset lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets.52Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedChanges in asset lives due to the results of the life studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations.There are several factors taken into account during the life study and they include:•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;•evaluation of current operations;•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;•previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use;•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. As individual assets within a specific group are retired, resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation. As part of the life study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study. Since the overall assumption with group-life is that the assets within the group on average have the same life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time.In the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales, resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately. These acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred. Examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage (e.g., major hurricanes), the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets (e.g., disposal of all refrigerated freight cars).Recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $976 million and $947 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. A 1% change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $10 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. The Company completed life studies for its equipment assets in 2009 and concluded life studies for its road, track and equipment assets in 2008 resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense of $11 million in 2010 and $18 million in 2009.53Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedIncome TaxesCSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2009. The federal income tax return for 2010 currently is under review. During 2011, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax year 2011. Management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2011, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $22 million.New Accounting Pronouncements and Change in Accounting PolicySee Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy.”Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs. At December 2011, CSX had $44 million of outstanding floating rate debt obligations outstanding. A 1% fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause a $1 million change in interest expense. This amount was determined by considering the impact of an interest rate fluctuation on the balances of our floating rate debt at December 30, 2011.54Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 8.

Risk Factors The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 6Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART INew legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices. Legislation passed by Congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business. For instance, several of the proposals under consideration by the STB could have a significant negative impact on the Company's ability to determine prices for rail services and meet service standards, which could force a reduction in capital spending. In addition, statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, the FRA and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies. For example, the RSIA mandated that the installation of an interoperable positive train control system (“PTC”) be completed by December 31, 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. In January 2010, the FRA issued its final rule on the design, operational requirements and implementation of the new PTC technology. In 2012, federal legislation was introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate that would, if reintroduced and approved in 2013, delay the PTC implementation deadline of 2015 by three to five years. However, even if either the regulatory requirements or the implementation date are further revised, the rule will continue to impose significant new costs on the Company and the rail industry. Noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. Climate change and other emissions-related legislation and regulation could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. Climate change and other emissions-related legislation and regulation have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has issued various regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (1) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (2) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States; (3) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (4) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner (particularly in the absence of similar regulations in countries like India and China). Any of these factors could reduce the amount of traffic the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 7Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ICapacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency. CSXT may experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased passenger activities, including high-speed rail, in capacity-constrained areas, or (ii) regulatory changes impacting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes, which could have a negative effect on CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency. General economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight. A decline in general domestic and global economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities and products the Company transports could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects. For example, if the rate of economic growth in Asia slows or if European economies contract, U.S. export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for CSX. In the event the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives, rail cars and other equipment, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on operations, financial condition and liquidity. Changing dynamics in the U.S. energy markets could negatively impact freight volumes.Over the past few years, production of natural gas in the U.S. has increased dramatically, which resulted in lower natural gas prices causing a negative impact on CSX. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which could further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation. A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems, and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials. 8Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water, the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials, the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases, and the health and safety of our employees. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which we are responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company. The Company has been, and may in the future, be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. The Company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business. The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. Such an event could result in increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. Disruption of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.Disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs. The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), other production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports, adverse political developments or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted. 9Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IFailure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The majority of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of Presidential intervention), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, or if terms of existing agreements are disputed, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. The Company faces competition from other transportation providers. The Company experiences competition in the form of pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations. Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.10Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ISevere weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage. The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations. The Company may be subject to lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. The Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits, including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Additionally, existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company's control. Final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves.Increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the Company's operating results. The Company faces inherent business risk from exposure to occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, including storm damage, and claims related to train accidents. The Company may incur significant costs to defend such claims. Existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company's control. Although the Company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the Company's insurance coverage.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.11Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IItem 2. Properties The Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern cities of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.CSXT’s track structure includes main thoroughfares, connecting terminals and yards (known as mainline track), track within terminals and switching yards, track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains, track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles are greater than CSXT’s approximately 21,000 route miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads. At December 2012, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track MilesMainline track26,215Terminals and switching yards9,466Passing sidings and turnouts928Total36,609In addition to its physical track structure, CSXT operates numerous yards and terminals. These serve as the hubs between CSXT and its local customers and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received, re-sorted and placed onto new outbound trains. The Company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume (number of rail cars or intermodal containers processed) are listed below:Yards and TerminalsAnnualVolume(number of units processed)Chicago, IL953,312Waycross, GA659,666Selkirk, NY570,290Willard, OH509,736Cincinnati, OH509,483Indianapolis, IN508,819Hamlet, NC486,381Nashville, TN483,469Louisville, KY365,265Birmingham, AL355,25712Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork Geography CSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent, high-speed intermodal, automotive and merchandise service. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries consumer goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, coal and intermodal.Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia, and provides access to major eastern ports.Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. CSXT’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Half the tons of export coal and nearly all of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity.See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network.13Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ICSX Rail Network14Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ILocomotives CSXT operates more than 4,000 locomotives, of which over 97% are owned by CSXT. Freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull trains. Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar is attached to the right train in order to deliver it to its final destination. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. At December 2012, CSXT’s fleet of owned and long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following types of locomotives: Locomotives % Average Age(years)Freight 3,650 87% 20Switching 319 8% 32Auxiliary Units 209 5% 19Total 4,178 100% 20 Equipment In 2012, the average daily fleet of cars on line consisted of approximately 190,000. At any time over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by the Company. Examples of these are as follows: railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service) and multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared among railroads). The Company’s revenue generating equipment (either owned or long-term leased) consists of freight cars and containers as described below. Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions.Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine. Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSTRATEGIC OVERVIEW CSX provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers with its approximately 32,000 dedicated employees. The Company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the economic success and global competitiveness of the United States. This global competitiveness and the expected continued growth in manufacturing is beneficial to the rail industry. Over the long-term, the U.S. demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise along with the need to reduce highway congestion and greenhouse gas emissions. CSX and freight railroads provide the most environmentally-efficient and economical means to meet this growing demand. CSX can move a ton of freight approximately 450 miles on one gallon of fuel. Shipping freight by rail also alleviates highway congestion. On average, trains are more fuel efficient than trucks as one rail car can move the equivalent of three truckloads.CSX's network is positioned to reach nearly two-thirds of Americans, who account for the majority of the nation's consumption of goods. Through this network, the Company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the country's needs. These products range from agricultural goods, such as grains, to chemicals, automobiles, metals, building materials, paper, consumer products, and energy sources like coal, ethanol and crude oil. The Company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business: merchandise, intermodal and coal. CSX's transportation solutions connect industries across the United States with each other and with global markets by meeting the transportation needs of port facilities, energy producers, manufacturers, industrial producers, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers and the United States armed forces. The rebirth of the U.S. automotive industry and the development of new domestic energy sources have led to increased volume in some of CSX's merchandise markets, specifically in shipments of automobiles, frac sand, crude oil and pipe. The recent growth in U.S. manufacturing is largely due to an increase in foreign labor costs, as well as lower domestic energy prices resulting from the increase in the supply of natural gas. These, among other, economic and supply chain factors are encouraging manufacturers to expand or move production back to the United States. The Company continues to position itself to secure volume related to growth in these markets. Strategic Growth InitiativesThe Company is focusing on three key strategic growth initiatives related to intermodal, export coal and an initiative to enhance customer service quality also known as Total Service Integration. The Company believes these opportunities will allow it to gain additional domestic and international volume, while improving service offerings to its customers in a cost-effective manner. 23Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIIntermodalThe Company's intermodal business is an economical, environmentally-friendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck. CSX is capitalizing on this opportunity by building new terminals and increasing network capacity to broaden its market presence in key growth areas. The Company's Northwest Ohio intermodal terminal, which became operational in 2011, is part of CSX's National Gateway initiative discussed below. This high-capacity terminal expands service offerings to customers, improves market access to and from east coast ports and consumption centers and enhances the fluidity of the network. During 2012, the Company completed construction of new intermodal terminals in Louisville, Kentucky and Worcester, Massachusetts and completed major terminal expansion projects in Charlotte, North Carolina and Columbus, Ohio. In addition, the Company began construction on a new intermodal terminal in Winter Haven, Florida this year. These projects further enhance the Company's intermodal offering and support the growth the Company experienced over the last few years. Export Coal Economic expansion in China, India and Brazil and other developing countries has generated a growth cycle in export coal demand. Over the long term, demand for coal in these countries is expected to remain high due to rising consumption as they become more urbanized, which is increasing the need for electric power generation and steel production. These increases in global coal demand are likely to be met by shipments from coal producing countries, including the U.S, which has abundant coal deposits. In addition to the Company's ready access to large U.S. coal suppliers and multiple port facilities, CSX continues to enhance the capacity and operating efficiency of its export coal network, which favorably positions the Company to capitalize on this growth opportunity. In the long term, this export coal demand is expected to partially offset declines in domestic utility coal volume that has resulted from low natural gas prices and environmental regulation. Although the Company expects long-term growth in the export coal market, CSX export traffic volume and pricing will be subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy and competition from foreign coal producers. Total Service IntegrationCSX's Total Service Integration (“TSI”) initiative supports growth through improved service, optimized train size, and increased asset utilization for unit train shipments from origin to destination. Building on this momentum, CSX is now focusing on another initiative to enhance service quality for customers who ship by the carload. This program, TSI Carload, focuses where the customer is impacted most - during the first and last mile of service. These enhancements aim to improve service levels and reliability of rail transportation over other modes of transportation. These improvements to operational processes, customer communication and service are better aligning CSX's operating capabilities with customers' needs and enabling the Company to capitalize on the growth opportunities described above. During 2012, CSX implemented new technology and processes to provide customers with proactive and transparent communications. These tools include real time notifications of departures and work to be completed, proactive alerts for cars that may be delayed and notices for work that will not be performed. 24Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIPublic-Private Partnerships Expanding capacity on U.S. rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation, increased business activity at U.S. ports, reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions. Therefore, CSX and its government partners are working jointly to invest in multi-year rail infrastructure projects such as the National Gateway. This initiative is a public-private partnership which will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between Mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest for double-stack intermodal trains. CSX is engaged in another major partnership initiative with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to expand freight and commuter rail service. This partnership provided an expanded intermodal terminal footprint, relocation of bulk commodity operations and double-stack intermodal clearance from Worcester to the New York state line. In 2012, CSX sold its corridor between Boston and Worcester to the Commonwealth to allow increased commuter rail service while retaining the right to utilize this corridor for freight service.CSX entered into a transaction with the state of Florida in 2011 to help alleviate highway congestion through a new commuter rail operation, known as SunRail. CSX sold a portion of its track to the state of Florida for its new commuter rail and will invest the proceeds in additional freight rail capacity and infrastructure within the state. Balanced Approach to Cash DeploymentCSX remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business, dividend growth and share repurchases. In 2012, the Company invested $2.3 billion to further enhance the capacity, quality, safety and flexibility of its network. Included in this amount is $166 million of investments related to reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year. In addition, CSX continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 10 times over the last seven year period which represents a 33 percent compounded annual growth rate. In 2012, CSX completed a $2 billion share repurchase authority that was announced in 2011. While delivering shareholder value through this balanced approach to cash deployment, the Company remains committed to an improving investment grade credit profile.In summary, these strategic initiatives and long-term investments discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth and productivity improvement, enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations. To continue these types of investments, the Company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value. CSX will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the Company's rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies.25Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II2012 HIGHLIGHTSOperating income increased 1% to $3.5 billion and the operating ratio improved 30 basis points to 70.6%. Both improved on the strength of efficiency gains and resource adjustments.

Volume decreased 1% from prior year as lower coal shipments were partially offset by growth in intermodal and automotive volume. Pricing gains and higher fuel recovery drove increases in revenue per unit in all markets. Expenses were lower when compared to prior year for several reasons. Real estate gains as well as lower incentive compensation and cost savings from crew labor efficiencies and lower volume reduced expenses. These decreases were offset by higher depreciation and inflation-related costs. For additional information, refer to Results of Operations discussed on pages 33 through 36.26Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIIn addition to the financial highlights described above, the Company measures and reports safety and service performance. The Company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training, initiatives and investment. For example, the Company's safety and train accident prevention programs rely on broad employee involvement. The programs utilize operating rules training, compliance measurement, root cause analysis and communication that are intended to create a safer environment for employees and the public. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.The Company routinely collaborates with the FRA and industry organizations as well as federal, state and local governments on the development and implementation of safety programs and initiatives. For example, CSX, Operation Lifesaver, Inc., the U.S. Department of Transportation and other major railroads from across the country have partnered in the Common Sense campaign to reduce the number of injuries and deaths around tracks and trains. In addition to these initiatives, CSXT also has an ongoing public safety program to clear-cut trees and vegetation at public passive highway-rail intersections (crossings with no flashing lights or gates) to improve the public's ability to discern rail hazards.At CSX, operational success is built on employee commitment to customer service while at the same time maintaining a constant focus on safety. In 2012, both key safety measures improved significantly versus the previous year. The FRA reportable personal injury frequency index improved by 26 percent year over year to a record low of 0.69, showing extraordinary employee dedication to the Company's safety initiative. The reported FRA train accident frequency rate improved 18 percent year over year to 1.98.Network reliability and service metrics showed strong improvements during 2012. On-time originations improved 24 percent to a record 89 percent, and on-time arrivals improved 29 percent to 80 percent. Average train velocity increased 10 percent to 22.7 miles per hour, while dwell improved 8 percent to 23.7 hours.27Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIOperating Statistics (Estimated) Fiscal Years 2012 2011 ImprovementSafety and FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index0.69 0.93 26%Service Measurements FRA Train Accident Rate1.98 2.41 18% On-Time Train Originations89% 72% 24% On-Time Destination Arrivals80% 62% 29% Dwell23.7 25.9 8% Cars-On-Line189,994 206,432 8% Train Velocity22.7 20.6 10% Increase/ (Decrease)Resources Route Miles20,741 20,821 —% Locomotives (owned and long-term leased)4,178 4,126 1% Freight Cars (owned and long-term leased)69,419 68,665 1%DefinitionsFRA Personal Injury Frequency Index – Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours.FRA Train Accident Rate – Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.On-Time Train Originations – Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.On-Time Destination Arrivals – Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to two hours late (30 minutes for intermodal trains).Dwell – Average amount of time in hours between car arrival at and departure from the yard.

Management believes that free cash flow is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. As described below, free cash flow before dividends decreased $601 million year over year to $721 million. The primary reasons for the decrease in free cash flow from the previous year are higher payments for income taxes as well as payments related to the ratification of labor agreements and a pension contribution. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure).

These investments of $166 million, $102 million and $15 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010,respectively, are projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. 29Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the SEC, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements.

Pricing gains and higher fuel recovery drove increases in revenue per unit in all markets. As a result, total revenue was slightly higher year-over-year.MerchandiseAgriculturalAgricultural Products - Volume decreased due to reduced shipments of corn and ethanol. Corn shipments for animal feed declined as drought conditions in the Midwest impacted harvest levels and drove corn prices higher. Further contributing to this decline, customers in the Southeast took advantage of lower cost imported grains and a strong local crop, both of which are transported by truck. Ethanol shipments declined as a result of higher corn prices and reduced gasoline demand.Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume was flat year-over-year. Fertilizer shipments were lower in the first half of the year as the expectation of moderating prices resulted in delayed purchases by farmers. This decline in the first half was offset by growth in fertilizer in the second half resulting from low river levels that shifted business that traditionally moves via barge to rail. Additionally, producers advanced shipments of fertilizer in the fourth quarter in anticipation of an expected increased application by farmers in 2013. Food and Consumer - Volume declined year-over-year. Appliance shipments were lower due to intermodal conversions, lower sales incentives by manufacturers and a moderating economy. The decline in appliances was partially offset by growth in refrigerated products due to highway-to-rail conversions.IndustrialChemicals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in energy-related markets (that include frac sand, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and crude oil) due to the increase in shale drilling activity. Additionally, plastics shipments grew to support growth predominately in automotive and packaging. Automotive - Volume grew as North American light vehicle production increased 17% to meet pent up demand as the average vehicle age in the U.S. reached record highs.Metals - Volume was slightly lower primarily due to the decline in scrap shipments as a result of lower steel mill utilization rates and lower scrap exports driven by moderating global demand.Housing and ConstructionEmerging Markets - Volume declined due to reduced shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) resulting from the completion of several road construction projects versus the prior year. Additionally, shipments of salt declined in the early part of this year as inventories remained high due to reduced road application during the previous mild winter. Forest Products - Volume increased in building products due to recovering demand for housing and construction, which was partially offset by a decline in the paper markets affected by electronic media substitution.34Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICoalShipments of utility coal declined primarily driven by low natural gas prices, which drove displacement of coal at utilities served by CSX. In addition, utility stockpiles remained well above target levels and overall electric generation in the eastern U.S. declined. Utility coal declines were partially offset by higher export shipments driven by increased shipments of U.S. thermal coal. In 2012, CSX shipped 47.8 million tons of export coal.IntermodalIntermodal volume increased due to growth in both domestic and international markets. Domestic shipment growth resulted from highway-to-rail conversions and increased demand from both new and existing customers. International growth was driven by a new customer and expanded service offerings primarily enabled by the Northwest Ohio terminal. ExpenseIn 2012, total expenses decreased $26 million compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $53 million primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense and crew labor costs. Crew labor costs decreased as volume declined as well as efficiencies gained from management's action to reduce resources. These decreases were partially offset by wage inflation and increased pension and other post-employment benefit expense.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities as well as professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expense decreased by $73 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by the following:•Gains recognized increased $102 million year-over-year, primarily related to the additional recognition of the deferred gain from the prior year sale of an operating corridor to the State of Florida of $80 million. •As a result of efficiency initiatives and the decline in volume, the reduction of active locomotives drove a decrease in material and repair costs. •Continued improvement in safety trends lowered casualty expenses. • Although the number of train accidents continued to decline, a few costly derailments more than offset these decreases.•Inflation also partially offset the items above.35Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIFuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $4 million primarily due to a 4% increase in average price per gallon for locomotive fuel. Average fuel price per gallon increased $0.12 to $3.18 in 2012 versus a year ago. The increase in average fuel price was partially offset by decreased volume and improved network efficiency and fuel saving initiatives.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $83 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending as well as cycling of a prior year favorable adjustment to asset retirements.Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses increased $13 million primarily related to higher automotive volume partially offset by cost savings associated with improved asset utilization. OtherInterest ExpenseInterest expense increased $14 million to $566 million primarily due to higher average debt balances partially offset by lower interest rates. The primary use of proceeds from the 2012 debt issuances was for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness due in both 2012 and early 2013 as well as a contribution to the Company's qualified pension plans.Other Income – NetOther income - net increased $51 million to $73 million primarily related to a gain on the sale of a non-operating real estate.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased $39 million to $1.1 billion primarily due to higher earnings during 2012 and the cycling of prior year state income tax related adjustments.Net EarningsNet earnings increased $37 million to $1.9 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $0.12 to $1.79 due to the factors mentioned above Lower average shares outstanding also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share.36Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II2011 vs. 2010 Results of Operations Fiscal Years 2011 2010 $ Change % Change(Dollars in Millions) Revenue $11,743 $10,636 $1,107 10 %Expense Labor and Fringe 3,073 2,957 (116) (4)Materials, Supplies and Other 2,229 2,075 (154) (7)Fuel 1,668 1,212 (456) (38)Depreciation 976 947 (29) (3)Equipment and Other Rents 379 374 (5) (1)Total Expense 8,325 7,565 (760) (10)Operating Income $3,418 $3,071 $347 11Interest Expense (552) (557) 5 1Other Income - Net 22 32 (10) (31)Income Tax Expense (1,066) (983) (83) (8)Net Earnings $1,822 $1,563 $259 17Earnings Per Diluted Share: Net Earnings $1.67 $1.35 $0.32 24 %Operating Ratio 70.9% 71.1% 20 bpsVolume and Revenue (Unaudited)Volume (Thousands of units); Revenue (Dollars in Millions); Revenue Per Unit (Dollars)Fiscal Years (a) Volume Revenue Revenue Per Unit 2011 2010 % Change 2011 2010 % Change 2011 2010 % ChangeAgricultural Agricultural Products 424 446 (5)% $1,048 $1,056 (1)% $2,472 $2,368 4%Phosphates and Fertilizers 321 313 3 490 465 5 1,526 1,486 3Food and Consumer 101 102 (1) 263 245 7 2,604 2,402 8Industrial Chemicals 462 461 — 1,596 1,485 8 3,455 3,221 7Automotive 361 340 6 936 800 17 2,593 2,353 10Metals 265 243 9 613 520 18 2,313 2,140 8Housing and Construction Emerging Markets 439 418 5 672 615 9 1,531 1,471 4Forest Products 281 265 6 684 600 14 2,434 2,264 8Total Merchandise 2,654 2,588 3 6,302 5,786 9 2,375 2,236 6Coal 1,533 1,573 (3) 3,709 3,267 14 2,419 2,077 17Intermodal(b) 2,289 2,223 3 1,434 1,291 11 626 581 8Other — — — 298 292 2 — — —Total 6,476 6,384 1 % $11,743 $10,636 10 % $1,813 $1,666 9%(a) CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar and 2010 included 53 weeks. The revenue impact for the extra week was $171 million.(b) In fourth quarter 2011, CSX reduced revenue by $18 million correcting the first nine months of 2011 intermodal revenue on certain interline business. This adjustment is presented in intermodal revenue above and is considered immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.37Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II2011 vs. 2010 Results of OperationsCSX full year results reflect positive year-over-year volume and revenue growth as demand for rail service in the markets CSX serves continued to support profitable growth. Ongoing emphasis on pricing above rail inflation, along with higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices, drove revenue-per-unit increases in all markets. Fiscal year 2010 results include an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year 2011. Volume and Revenue Merchandise AgriculturalAgricultural Products – Volume declined as the amount of feed shipments declined as a result of higher corn prices and decreased production from producers of poultry and pork. These reductions were slightly offset by growth in ethanol and increased shipments of soybeans into the Southeast due to low inventories. Phosphates and Fertilizers – Shipments of domestic fertilizers grew as farmers replenished inventories to improve crop yields as a result of higher anticipated crop prices. Export demand was also strong with recovery in exports to Central and South America after the prior year's drought. Shipments of phosphate rock, which is used to make fertilizer, grew as suppliers are stocking up in anticipation of a strong spring season.Food and Consumer – Volume decreased as lower appliance shipments resulting from continued weakness in the housing sector was partially offset by strength in truckload conversions of refrigerated products and manufactured goods.IndustrialChemicals – Volume was flat as strength in frac sand (used in the extraction of gas and petroleum) resulted from the increase in natural gas drilling. This increase was offset by a reduction in basic chemical markets, like plastics, which experienced weak consumer demand and inventory destocking.Automotive - Automotive volume grew as North American automotive production increased to meet pent up demand from delayed purchases during the slowed economy over the last few years.Metals – Volume growth was driven by strong export demand for scrap shipments and higher domestic steel production resulting from strong demand in the automotive and oil and gas sectors for products such as sheet steel and pipe.Housing and ConstructionEmerging Markets – Volume increased primarily driven by improved shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel), cement and waste (such as construction and demolition debris) as a result of new distribution facilities and overall market growth related to the improving economy. Forest Products – Volume increased, despite the weakness in housing-related markets, primarily related to strength in shipments of pulp board and paper used in packaging for consumer products and increased shipments of building products resulting from inventory replenishments.38Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICoalShipments of utility coal declined as electrical generation declined in the eastern U.S., natural gas prices remained low and utility stockpiles were above target levels. This decrease was partially offset by higher export shipments driven by greater demand for U.S. coal in Europe, South America and Asia. During 2011, CSX shipped 40.2 million tons of export coal. The increase in revenue per unit was driven by improved yield, positive mix and fuel recovery. Intermodal International and domestic shipment growth resulted from expanded service offerings, over-the-road conversions, and service and network enhancements. The increase in revenue per unit was driven by increased fuel recovery, improved yields and favorable traffic mix. This revenue-per-unit increase was partially offset by the impact of switching from a purchased transportation arrangement to a domestic interline program in the prior year. This program, known as UMAX, provides customers with containers for local shipments or transcontinental service provided jointly by CSX and Union Pacific Corporation.Other Other revenue increased due to stronger affiliate revenue and higher incidental charges mostly offset by lower benefits for contract volume commitments as compared to the prior year. ExpenseIn 2011, total expenses increased $760 million or 10% to $8.3 billion compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $116 million primarily driven by inflation, increased resource levels and other labor-related costs associated with training focused on service improvements partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities as well as professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expense increased by $154 million in 2011. The increase was primarily driven by the following:•Volume-related expenses and inflation increased as a result of higher operating and maintenance costs at automotive facilities, coal piers and intermodal terminals. Additionally, maintenance expense increased due to a higher active count of locomotives in service as compared to prior year. Higher travel costs for train crews and other volume-related expenses also contributed to this increase. •Casualty expenses increased year-over-year primarily due to the prior year benefit of $49 million not repeated in the current year. This benefit was a result of improvements in safety and occupational claim trends.39Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II•Expense increases were partially offset by approximately $37 million of reduced transportation costs as a result of switching from a purchased transportation agreement to the UMAX domestic interline program in 2010. Additionally, an operating property transaction with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts closed during 2010 and resulted in a $30 million net book loss on a pre-tax basis. Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $456 million primarily due to a 26% increase in average price per gallon for locomotive fuel. Average fuel price per gallon increased $0.80 from $2.26 in 2010 to $3.06 in 2011.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $29 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending partially offset by a multi-year adjustment related to retirements as well as the impact of prior year's additional expense related to the extra week.Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses increased $5 million primarily due to volume-related expenses partially offset by cost savings associated with improved asset utilization. OtherInterest ExpenseInterest expense decreased $5 million to $552 million primarily due to lower average interest rates offset by higher average debt balances during 2011.Other Income – NetOther income - net decreased $10 million to $22 million related to lower real estate sales and increased non-operating expenses.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased $83 million to $1.1 billion due to higher earnings during 2011 offset by certain state income tax related adjustments compared to a year ago.Net EarningsNet earnings increased $259 million to $1.8 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $0.32 to $1.67 in 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income net of income taxes in 2011.40Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IILIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to implement regulatory and legislative initiatives. In order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed.Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash FlowsConsolidated Balance SheetsCSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend improvement and share repurchases.Total assets increased $1.2 billion from prior year. Assets increased primarily due to the increase in net properties of $1.1 billion driven by planned capital spending.Total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $1.2 billion. Increases were from total net debt activity of $591 million mostly due to additional borrowings; higher deferred income tax liability of $495 million primarily related to the net impact of bonus depreciation on tax accruals; and stronger net earnings of $1.9 billion. Partially offsetting these increases were share repurchases of $734 million, dividends paid of $558 million and a pension plan contribution of $275 million. Sources of CashThe Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2012, the Company generated $2.9 billion of cash from operating activities which decreased $545 million from prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by a contribution to the Company's qualified pension plans and higher payments for income taxes as well as payments related to the ratification of labor agreements in 2012. In 2011, the Company generated $3.5 billion of cash from operating activities which represented a $230 million increase from the prior year, driven by higher earnings. Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in September 2016. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information.CSX filed its shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 15, 2013. This shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.41Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIUses of CashCSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2012, net cash used in investing activities was driven by $2.3 billion of property additions, which was consistent with the prior year. In 2011, net cash used in investing activities was also driven by $2.3 billion of property additions which increased $457 million from prior year. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

These investments of $166 million, $102 million and $15 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. Planned capital investments for 2013 are $2.3 billion, including expected spending of approximately $325 million for Positive Train Control (""PTC""). This amount excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year. Over half of the 2013 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. The remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives, freight cars, high return projects that drive growth and productivity such as intermodal terminal capacity and major track expansion along the River Line between northern New Jersey and the Albany, N.Y., region. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations. Over the long term, the Company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC. CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be at least $1.7 billion. This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. Total PTC spending life-to-date through 2012 was approximately $585 million.In addition to capital investments, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases, share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders. In 2012, net cash used in financing activities was $668 million, which was a decrease in spending of $745 million. Share repurchases were lower by $830 million and partially offsetting this were higher dividend payments of $78 million as a result of an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.14 per share in second quarter 2012. 42Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIIn 2011, net cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion which increased $186 million from the prior year primarily as a result of $1.6 billion of share repurchases partially offset by net debt in 2011. CSX paid dividends of $480 million in 2011, which was $108 million more than prior year. This increase was due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.09 per share at the beginning of 2011 and then to $0.12 in second quarter 2011.CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations. Although new legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K), it is too early to predict the manner or severity of such impact. Liquidity and Working CapitalCurrently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX has a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility expires in September 2016 and as of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. Additionally in 2012, CSX issued a total of $1.1 billion of new long-term debt. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock and dividends to shareholders. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements. The Company's $250 million receivables securitization facility has a 364-day term and expires in December 2013. The Company's intention is to continue to renew this facility prior to its expiration. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity. Under the terms of this facility, CSXT transfers eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX services the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. In the event CSX Trade Receivables draws under this facility, the Company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility.Working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $174 million and $248 million at December 2012 and 2011, respectively. This lower surplus since the prior year is primarily due to reclassification of current portion of long-term debt that will mature within a year This decline was offset by payments made for incentive compensation and other labor and fringe liabilities as well as for short-term debt paid. Also, see sources and uses of cash description above.The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.43Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICredit Ratings Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings have improved during 2012. Currently, CSX is rated BBB with a positive outlook by S&P and Baa2 with a stable outlook by Moody's, compared to a rating of BBB with a stable outlook by S&P and Baa3 with a positive outlook by Moody's at December 2011. Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.SCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTSThe following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other commitments: Type of Obligation20132014201520162017ThereafterTotal(Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations Total Debt (See Note 9)$780$527$629$22$631$7,243$9,832Interest on Debt5665294804594375,8608,331Purchase Obligations (See Note 7)5594063062712521,8873,681Other Post-Employment Benefits (See Note 8) (a)5655535150223488Operating Leases - Net (See Note 7) (b)4570353228140350Agreements with Conrail (b)2626252524162288Public-Private Partnerships (See Note 6) (c)146322210165Total Contractual Obligations$2,178$1,616$1,530$862$1,424$15,525$23,135Other Commitments (d)$127—————$127(a)Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans which are unfunded.

These amounts plus total operating leases-net of $350 million above equals total net lease commitments of $638 million disclosed in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.(c)Public-Private Partnerships primarily include contractual commitments to the state of Florida resulting from the sale of a portion of the Company's track. (d)Other commitments of $127 million consisted of surety bonds, letters of credit and uncertain tax positions. Surety bonds of $69 million and letters of credit of $34 million arise from assurances issued by a third-party that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement. Uncertain tax positions of $24 million which include interest and penalties are all included in year 2013. The year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated, however, the Company believes at least $3 million of these unrecognized tax benefits will be resolved in the next 12 months. 44Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSFor detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:•casualty, environmental and legal reserves;•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and•income taxes. Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves CasualtyCasualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury, occupational injury and asbestos claims. During 2010 the Company increased its self-insured retention amount for these claims from $25 million to $50 million per occurrence for claims occurring on or after June 1, 2010. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Company's self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC""), to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent third-party estimates, which are reviewed by management. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation.Most of the claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities.As of December 2012, the Company had $325 million in casualty reserves. See below for details regarding changes in estimate for casualty reserves.45Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedPersonal Injury Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”). In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm quarterly and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience.During 2012 and 2011, there were no significant changes in estimates in personal injury reserves. Adjustments to the reserves are included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.Occupational & AsbestosOccupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as “irritants”) and diesel fuels (from exhaust fumes) or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss.The Company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. Other types of exposures, however, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business. Diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods (amount of time between exposure to a disease and the onset of the disease) which can range from 10 to 40 years after exposure.Occupational and asbestos claims are analyzed by a third-party actuary or specialist (the ""third-party specialist""), respectively, in order to determine the number of unasserted or incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Analyses of both types of claims are performed by the third-party specialist and reviewed by management. This review is quarterly for occupational claims and annually for asbestos claims. Since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated, this review is completed annually. For asserted occupational and asbestos claims, management reviews quarterly. With the exception of carpal tunnel, management has determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which unasserted claim filings and claim values can be estimated. Carpal tunnel claims use a three-year period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries.The third-party specialists analyze CSXT’s historical claim filings, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for occupational and asbestos claims reserves. The potentially exposed population is estimated by using CSX employment records and industry data. From this analysis, the third-party specialists provide an estimate of the IBNR claims liability.46Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedThe estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims.During 2012 and 2011, there were no significant changes in estimates recorded to adjust occupational or asbestos reserves. Adjustments in reserves are included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.Environmental The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 248 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.In accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:•type of clean-up required;•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.47Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedAs of December 2012, the Company had $88 million in environmental reserves. These recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries. Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements.Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund the current remedial actions.LegalIn accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards.See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan AccountingThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. As of December 2012, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $3.0 billion. During the first quarter 2012, the Company made a contribution of $275 million to its qualified pension plans, of which $25 million was the required minimum contribution.48Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedIn addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a self-insured post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Prior to 2011, the post-retirement medical plan was partially funded by all participating retirees, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. Beginning in 2011, Medicare-eligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Non-Medicare eligible retirees continue to be covered by the existing self-insured program. The life insurance plan is non-contributory.For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;•long-term rate of return on plan assets;•salary scale inflation rates; and•other assumptions.The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. The Company reviews the discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, salary scale inflation rates and other assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate.Discount Rates Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2012 pension and post-retirement obligations are 3.75% and 3.20%, respectively. For 2011, the discount rate used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations was 4.75% and 4.25%, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2012, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years, respectively.Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.49Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedLong-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its pension obligation was 7.75% and 8% in 2012 and 2011, respectively.Salary Scale Inflation Rates Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 3.75% and 4% to value its 2012 and 2011 pension obligations, respectively.Other AssumptionsThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are selected by management.2013 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement ExpenseNet pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2013 is expected to be approximately $95 million and $29 million, respectively, compared to $81 million and $28 million, respectively, in 2012. The increase in the pension expense is primarily related to additional amortization of the actuarial losses incurred by the pension plan and the decrease in the discount rate (which causes expense to increase), partially offset by the return on discretionary contributions made during 2012.The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries and health care costs on the 2012 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:(Dollars in Millions) Pension OPEB Discount Rate 1% change $21 $2Long-term Rate of Return 1% change $21 N/ASalary Inflation 1% change $10 N/A50Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedDepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life MethodThe Company depreciates its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise over 85% of total fixed assets of $35 billion on a gross basis at December 2012. All other assets of the Company are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life.The Company currently utilizes more than 130 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method of accounting. Examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets. All assets of the Company are depreciated on a time or life basis.The Company believes the group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g., track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets.Under the group-life method of accounting, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management's assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study (also referred to as a life study) is the periodic review of asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets every three years and for road (e.g. bridges and signals) and track (e.g., rail, ties and ballast) assets every six years. The Company believes the frequency currently required by the STB provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets.Changes in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations.There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;•evaluation of current operations;•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;•previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use;•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.51Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedFor retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. As individual assets within a specific group are retired, resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation. As part of the depreciation study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study. Since the overall assumption with group-life is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time.In the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales, resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately. These acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred. Examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage (e.g., major hurricanes), the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets (e.g., disposal of all refrigerated freight cars).Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $1.1 billion and $1 billion for 2012 and 2011, respectively. A 1% change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $10 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. In 2012, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets and a technical update (an update to the prior depreciation study) for its road and track assets. Additionally, in 2009, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets. These studies resulted in an annual net reduction in depreciation expense which were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. Income TaxesCSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2010. The federal income tax return for 2011 currently is under review. During 2012, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax year 2012. Management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2012, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $24 million.52Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IINew Accounting Pronouncements and Change in Accounting PolicySee Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy.”Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs. At December 2012, CSX had $25 million of floating rate debt obligations outstanding. A 1% fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause less than a $1 million change in interest expense. This amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical interest rate fluctuation on the balances of our floating rate debt at December 28, 2012.53Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 8.

Risk Factors The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 6Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART INew legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices. Legislation passed by Congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business. For instance, several of the proposals under consideration by the STB could have a significant negative impact on the Company's ability to negotiate prices for the value of rail services provided and meet service standards, which could force a reduction in capital spending. In addition, statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, the FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies. For example, the RSIA mandated that the installation of PTC be completed by December 31, 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. Noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. Climate change and other emissions-related legislation and regulation could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. Climate change and other emissions-related legislation and regulation have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and is expected to issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (1) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (2) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States; (3) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (4) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner (particularly in the absence of similar regulations in other manufacturing countries). Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Capacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency. CSXT may experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased passenger activities, including high-speed rail, in capacity-constrained areas, or (ii) regulatory changes impacting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes, which could have a negative effect on CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency. 7Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IGeneral economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight. A decline in general domestic and global economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities and products the Company transports could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects. For example, if the rate of economic growth in Asia slows or if European economies contract, U.S. export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for CSX. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives, railcars and other equipment, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on operations, financial condition and liquidity. Changing dynamics in the U.S. energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Over the past few years, production of natural gas in the U.S. has increased dramatically, which resulted in lower natural gas prices causing a negative impact on CSX. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which could further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate. CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems, and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials. The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water, the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials, the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases, and the health and safety of our employees. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which we are responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company. 8Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company has been, and may in the future, be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. The Company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business. The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. Such an event could result in increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.Disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs. The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports, adverse political developments or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted. Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Most of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of Presidential intervention), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, or if terms of existing agreements are disputed, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. 9Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers. The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations. Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage. The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations. The Company may be subject to lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. The Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits, including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Additionally, existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company's control. Final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves. 10Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIncreases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the Company's operating results. The Company faces inherent business risk from exposure to occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, including storm damage, and claims related to train accidents. The Company may incur significant costs to restore these damages and defend such claims. Existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company's control. Although the Company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the Company's insurance coverage.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNoneItem 2. Properties The Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern cities of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.CSXT’s track structure includes main thoroughfares, connecting terminals and yards (known as mainline track), track within terminals and switching yards, track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains, track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles are greater than CSXT’s approximately 21,000 route miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads. At December 2013, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track MilesMainline track26,411Terminals and switching yards9,420Passing sidings and turnouts921Total36,752In addition to its physical track structure, CSXT operates numerous yards and terminals. These serve as the hubs between CSXT and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars often are received, re-sorted and placed onto new outbound trains. The Company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume (number of railcars or intermodal containers processed) are listed below: 11Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IYards and TerminalsAnnualVolume(number of units processed)Chicago, IL1,009,525Waycross, GA667,807Selkirk, NY584,905Willard, OH532,524Cincinnati, OH512,981Indianapolis, IN505,854Hamlet, NC471,061Nashville, TN453,273Louisville, KY378,101Toledo, OH375,595Network Geography CSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent, high-speed intermodal, automotive and merchandise service. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries consumer goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, coal and intermodal.Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia, and provides access to major eastern ports.Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. CSXT’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Almost half the tons of export coal and nearly all of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity.See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network. 12Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ICSX Rail Network 13Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART ILocomotives CSXT operates more than 4,000 locomotives, of which over 97% are owned by CSXT. Freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull trains. Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar is attached to the right train in order to deliver it to its final destination. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. At December 2013, CSXT’s fleet of owned and long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following types of locomotives: Locomotives % Average Age(years)Freight3,730 87% 20Switching320 8% 33Auxiliary Units209 5% 21Total4,259 100% 20 Equipment In 2013, the average daily fleet of cars on line consisted of approximately 182,000 cars. At any time over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by the Company. Examples of these non-CSXT railcars are as follows: railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service) and multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared among railroads). The Company’s revenue generating equipment (either owned or long-term leased) consists of freight cars and containers as described below. Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions.Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine. Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers.Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles.Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.Containers – Weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight. 14Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IOther cars on the network consist primarily of refrigerated boxcars for transporting perishable items.

As shown in the graph, CSX's five-year stock returns significantly outpaced those of the S&P 500. 18Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICSX Purchases of Equity Securities CSX is required to disclose any purchases of its own common stock for the most recent quarter. CSX purchases its own shares for two primary reasons: to further its goals under its share repurchase program and to fund the Company’s contribution required to be paid in CSX common stock under a 401(k) plan that covers certain union employees.In April 2013, the Company announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by April 2015. Management's assessment of market conditions and pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances. During 2013, CSX repurchased $353 million, or 14 million in shares of common stock under this program.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSTRATEGIC OVERVIEW CSX provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations with its approximately 31,000 dedicated employees. The Company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the economic success and improved global competitiveness of the United States. This improved competitiveness is driven by lower domestic energy prices from natural gas, increased foreign labor costs and supply chain factors. The rail industry benefits from this improved global competitiveness, continued economic growth and the shift towards more rail-based solutions. U.S. demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise and freight railroads provide the most environmentally-efficient and economical means to meet this growing demand. CSX can move a ton of freight about 450 miles on one gallon of diesel fuel, as trains are four times more fuel efficient than trucks on average. Shipping freight by rail also alleviates highway congestion, eases air pollution and saves energy.CSX's network is positioned to reach nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population, which accounts for the majority of the nation's consumption of goods. Through this network, the Company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the country's needs. These products range from agricultural goods, such as grains, to chemicals, automobiles, metals, building materials, paper, consumer products, and energy sources like coal, ethanol and crude oil. The Company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business: merchandise, intermodal and coal. CSX's transportation solutions connect industries and population centers across the United States with each other and with global markets through access to over 70 port facilities whereby meeting the transportation needs of energy producers, manufacturers, industrial producers, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers and the United States armed forces.Strategic Growth OpportunitiesIntermodalCSX’s intermodal business is an economical and environmentally-friendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck. CSX’s intermodal network connects all major population centers east of the Mississippi River and is 90% cleared for the use of double-stack (two containers high) intermodal movements. This positions the Company to capture a significant share of the incremental domestic intermodal market opportunity, estimated at the nine million truckloads in the eastern United States that move over 550 miles. The Company’s highway-to-rail initiatives assist in capturing this traffic and also help customers identify conversion opportunities for both domestic moves and the U.S. portion of international moves.CSX is capturing this opportunity by building new terminals and increasing network capacity to broaden its market presence in key growth areas. The Company's Northwest Ohio intermodal terminal, which started operations in 2011, is part of CSX's National Gateway initiative discussed below. This high-capacity terminal expands service offerings to customers, improves market access to and from east coast ports and consumption centers and enhances the fluidity of the network. During 2013, the Company opened or expanded terminals in Columbus, OH; Louisville, KY; Atlanta, GA; and Worcester, MA. The Company expects to open new terminals in Winter Haven, FL and Quebec, Canada in 2014. These projects further enhance the Company's intermodal offering and support future growth. 21Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIIllinois Basin Coal ShiftEnergy markets have shifted over the past few years and continue to evolve. In spite of recent declines in domestic utility coal consumption that primarily resulted from low natural gas prices, coal sourced from mines on the CSX network is now becoming more economical as natural gas prices have rebounded from historic lows. In addition, mining economics are causing a shift from Central Appalachian coal to thermal coal in the Illinois Basin and the Powder River Basin. To capitalize on these shifts, CSX continues to enhance its network to support these changes, such as adding sidings (track which enables trains on the same line to pass) and increasing yard capacity.Export CoalCSX export coal volume and pricing is subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy, competition from foreign coal producers and regulatory shifts. Over the past few years, CSX has capitalized on the global coal demand in both steel manufacturing and power generation, which is expected to remain high over the long term as developing countries become more urbanized. The Company remains opportunistic based on the global markets and the resulting level of demand. In addition to the Company’s ready access to large U.S. coal suppliers and multiple port facilities, CSX expects to continue to enhance the operating efficiency of its export coal network which will favorably position the Company to capitalize on growth as it is made available.New Energy Markets The ongoing surge in shale drilling for the extraction of oil and natural gas has created the opportunity for CSX to serve new energy markets such as crude oil, liquefied petroleum gases (“LPG”), frac sand and other related materials. For example, CSX is capitalizing on the opportunity to move the growing supply of crude oil from the new domestic oil fields, particularly those located in the Bakken Shale region of North Dakota, to customers at eastern refineries. This service also provides greater flexibility in source locations as compared to pipelines. CSX’s LPG market is also benefiting from drilling in the Utica Shale region, which underlies portions of Kentucky, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia. Midstream energy companies, which are involved in the transportation, storage and wholesale of refined petroleum products, are taking advantage of the abundance of inexpensive wet gas with newly constructed gas processing plants (or “fractionators”) in the region. Rail will also play a vital role in moving LPG products from the fractionators to the market. CSX’s frac sand market (a key input in the drilling process) has also expanded rapidly over the last few years. The Company has invested in new operating capacity such as railcars and terminals to accommodate this growth, which has been concentrated mainly in the Utica and Marcellus shale regions. The CSX network not only provides access to many frac sand transload terminals located near the drilling activity but also offers the advantage of CSX-direct routes from several key sand producing regions to the frac sand terminals. 22Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIOver the longer term, the improved energy supply outlook for the U.S. will create a sustainable competitive advantage for domestic chemical producers and generate additional growth opportunities for rail. Since natural gas is the primary component in the production of a wide range of petrochemicals, the supply growth and the resulting lower prices have now placed the U.S. amongst the lowest cost production regions in the world. This increased competitiveness is sparking significant investment in new U.S. chemical industry capacity for the first time in more than a decade. CSX is well-positioned to participate in this growing chemical business over the next several years.Operating Initiatives In support of these growth opportunities, CSX is focused on meeting customers’ needs while improving profitability. Several key operating initiatives have been implemented over the past several years that lay a foundation for meeting these objectives. Beginning with the ONE Plan, which was implemented nearly ten years ago, the Company is using advanced network modeling analytics and network tools to create a disciplined, scheduled approach to designing and running CSX's merchandise and automotive networks. The service improvements that continue to result from the implementation of the ONE Plan also drove CSX’s ability to deliver strong growth in the intermodal market. The ONE Plan continues to be used to identify the most efficient, cost-effective routes for CSXT customers' traffic while providing timely service with the fewest handlings and car miles possible. The second initiative is Total Service Integration (“TSI”), which is intended to align operating capabilities with customers' needs to reduce loading and unloading times and create more capacity. TSI was first implemented on the unit train network, where it has successfully increased the average number of cars per train and improved asset utilization. CSX is now implementing TSI for the carload network, which focuses on improving the “first and last mile” service experience for carload customers, providing a more consistent and reliable service product. The carload network is connected to more than 5,000 customer facilities and has a high degree of variability each day. New tools and technology are allowing the company to more effectively communicate with customers, not only providing the service the Company has promised to deliver but proactively notifying the customer of service status. Applying TSI to the carload network will improve service consistency for each merchandise shipper. The third initiative is Service Excellence, which is building a culture that engages all employees and focuses on the value delivered to customers through improved service. The initiative increases employee communication and dialogue to help identify and resolve customer issues at the lowest level, improving the customer experience and allowing CSX to grow the business. This process involves engagement from all operating employees, as well as collaboration with sales and marketing employees and, ultimately, with the Company’s customers. Higher levels of customer service and satisfaction support CSX’s ability to profitably grow the business by increasing customer retention, price sustainability and asset utilization. The fourth initiative is Enterprise Asset Management (“EAM”), which is a technology system that will help lower total cost of ownership and maximize the productivity and reliability of the railroad’s physical assets. The focus of EAM is on locomotives, cars and infrastructure. Projects are currently in place to deploy technology, improve processes and reduce unproductive time. Because the railroad is an asset intensive industry, EAM helps reduce the overall expense associated with asset ownership by monitoring the overall condition of equipment, helping proactively schedule maintenance, increasing utilization and also effectively managing the investment required for new or replacement assets. The system is also streamlining CSX’s asset management operations to improve the time the asset is in service as well as improving CSX’s return on assets. The intent of this initiative is to deliver operating efficiencies and reduce future capital expenditures associated with asset replacement. 23Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIPublic-Private PartnershipsExpanding capacity on U.S. rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation, increased business activity at U.S. ports, reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions. Therefore, CSX and its government partners are jointly working to invest in multi-year rail infrastructure projects such as the National Gateway. This initiative is a public-private partnership which will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between Mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest for double-stack intermodal trains. Other examples of the Company’s public-private partnerships are the nearly completed transactions with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the state of Florida. In both cases, the Company sold a portion of its track to expand freight and commuter rail service, while also alleviating highway congestion. Balanced Approach to Cash Deployment CSX remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business, dividend growth and share repurchases. In 2013, the Company invested $2.3 billion to further enhance the capacity, quality, safety and flexibility of its network. In addition, CSX continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During 2013, the Company announced a 7 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.15 per common share. The Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 11 times over the last eight years which represents a 30 percent compounded annual growth rate. Also during 2013, CSX announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program expected to be completed in 2015 based on market and business conditions. CSX repurchased $353 million in shares during 2013 under this new program. Since 2006, CSX has repurchased 287 million shares for $8.3 billion, which represents about one-third of total shares outstanding. The Company also remains committed to an improving investment grade credit profile.SummaryThese strategic growth areas, operating initiatives, long-term investments and shareholder returns discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth, productivity improvement, enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations. To continue these types of investments, the Company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value. CSX will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the Company's rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies. 24Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II2013 HIGHLIGHTS• Revenue of $12.0 billion increased $263 million or 2%.• Expenses of $8.6 billion increased $254 million or 3%.• Operating income of $3.5 billion remained flat. • Operating ratio of 71.1% increased 50 basis points from 70.6%.•Earnings per share of $1.83 increased $0.04 or 2%.

Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principle reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. As described below, free cash flow before dividends increased $174 million year over year to $895 million. The primary reason for the increase in free cash flow from the 2012 is due to the prior year contribution to the Company's qualified pension plans which did not repeat in the current year. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure).

These investments of $40 million, $166 million and $102 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011 respectively, are projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. 26Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIRESULTS OF OPERATIONS2013 vs. 2012 Results of Operations Fiscal Years 2013 2012 (a) $ Change % Change(Dollars in Millions) Revenue$12,026 $11,763 $263 2 %Expense Labor and Fringe3,138 3,020 (118) (4)Materials, Supplies and Other2,275 2,156 (119) (6)Fuel1,656 1,672 16 1Depreciation1,104 1,059 (45) (4)Equipment and Other Rents380 392 12 3Total Expense8,553 8,299 (254) (3)Operating Income3,473 3,464 9 —Interest Expense(562) (566) 4 1Other Income - Net11 73 (62) (85)Income Tax Expense(1,058) (1,108) 50 5Net Earnings$1,864 $1,863 $1 —Earnings Per Diluted Share: Net Earnings$1.83 $1.79 $0.04 2 %Operating Ratio71.1% 70.6% (50) bps(a) See the revision of prior period financial statements in Note 1.

Total revenue increased by 2% year-over-year driven by this volume growth and pricing gains across most markets. MerchandiseAgriculturalAgricultural Products - Volume declined due to a reduction in shipments of feed grain and ethanol. Feed grain shipments were impacted by low supplier inventories caused by last year’s drought and increased competition from imports. Ethanol shipments declined as a result of increased competition from imports, lower production and competitive losses.Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume growth was driven by the reopening of a customer mine that led to more short haul phosphates shipments that were previously sourced from an origin not located on CSX’s network.Food and Consumer - Volume declined due to a reduction in shipments of refrigerated products and alcoholic beverages. The decline in refrigerated products volume was driven by lower potato shipments as a result of more normalized production levels compared to the above-average yields in the prior year, while the decline in alcoholic beverages was primarily driven by a consolidation within a customer’s distribution network that resulted in lower shipments for CSX.IndustrialChemicals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in energy-related shipments that included crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas (""LPG"") and frac sand. The rise in crude oil shipments was due to increased supply of low-cost crude from shale drilling activity, resulting in new shipments to east coast refineries. Automotive - Finished vehicle shipments increased as North American light vehicle production grew year-over-year. This increase was partially offset by competitive losses in both automotive parts and finished vehicles.Metals - Volume was flat as a reduction in steel sheet shipments was offset by growth in aluminum products and steel plates. The reduction in shipments of steel sheet, which is used in automotive manufacturing, was driven by competitive losses, mill closures and source shifts. Shipments of aluminum product, which is used in a variety of products like packaging and construction, increased due to modal conversions. Shipments of steel plate, which is used in a wide range of end markets including construction, structural and energy applications, increased in support of continued growth in energy-related markets. Housing and ConstructionForest Products - Volume growth was led by an increase in building products due to the continued recovery of the residential housing market. 28Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIMinerals - Volume growth was led by an increase in salt shipments due to modal conversions, new customer distribution terminals and inventory replenishment from more severe winter weather in early 2013 that resulted in more application of salt to roads.Waste and Equipment - Volume growth was led by waste shipments which were driven by an increase in construction debris due to the continued recovery in construction activity and large scale remediation projects. CoalExport declines were driven by decreased shipments of U.S. thermal coal, as a result of global oversupply and lower coal prices. Shipments of domestic coal declined due to continued low natural gas prices and utility stockpiles above target levels.IntermodalDomestic volume growth was driven by continued success with highway-to-rail conversions, growth with existing customers, and service product enhancements. International volume increased due to strength with existing customers and the cycling of disruptions resulting from Hurricane Sandy last year.Other Other revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from customers who did not meet minimum contractual volumes. ExpenseIn 2013, total expenses increased $254 million, or 3%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $118 million primarily due to the following items:•Incentive compensation costs were $89 million higher reflecting higher expected award payouts.•Inflation increased expenses $61 million.•Partially offsetting these increases were labor and other costs which decreased $32 million primarily related to improvements in network efficiencies that resulted from the overall reduction in employees, fewer crew starts as well as lower training expenses. Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities as well as professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expense increased $119 million primarily driven by the following:•Inflation increased expenses $42 million.•Risk-related costs increased $39 million primarily due to higher expenses related to derailment costs as well as prior year favorable casualty adjustments that did not repeat in 2013. 29Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II•Volume, materials and services costs increased $19 million primarily due to increased expenses related to higher volume and resource levels.•Gains recognized decreased $19 million year over year. Gains from last year related to the sale of operating rail corridors to the state of Florida and to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts were $104 million. Gains in the current year were $85 million for the sale of operating rail corridor to the state of Florida, a non-monetary exchange of easements and rail assets as well as a deferred gain recognized from a closure arrangement related to a prior conveyance of a formerly-owned company.Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $16 million driven by the following:•Improved network efficiency and fuel savings initiatives decreased expenses by $38 million.•Average fuel price per gallon decreased $0.05 to $3.17 per gallon versus the prior year which reduced expenses by $26 million.•Partially offsetting these decreases were volume-related costs of $31 million as well as other costs of $17 million which includes an adjustment to an interline fuel receivable.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $45 million primarily due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending.Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $12 million primarily due to improved asset utilization partially offset by increased rates and volume.Interest expense decreased $4 million to $562 million primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average debt balances.Other income - net decreased $62 million to $11 million primarily related to the prior year gain recognized on the sale of a non-operating property that was not repeated in the current year.Income tax expense decreased $50 million to $1.06 billion primarily due to the year-over-year decrease in earnings before income taxes as well as federal and state legislative changes.Net earnings increased $1 million to $1.86 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.04 to $1.83 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share. 30Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II2012 vs. 2011 Results of Operations Fiscal Years 2012 (a) 2011 (a) $ Change % Change(Dollars in Millions) Revenue$11,763 $11,795 $(32) — %Expense Labor and Fringe3,020 3,073 53 2Materials, Supplies and Other2,156 2,229 73 3Fuel1,672 1,668 (4) —Depreciation1,059 976 (83) (9)Equipment and Other Rents392 379 (13) (3)Total Expense8,299 8,325 26 —Operating Income3,464 3,470 (6) —Interest Expense(566) (552) (14) (3)Other Income - Net73 22 51 232Income Tax Expense(1,108) (1,086) (22) (2)Net Earnings$1,863 $1,854 $9 1Earnings Per Diluted Share: Net Earnings$1.79 $1.70 $0.09 5 %Operating Ratio70.6% 70.6% 0 bps(a) See the revision of prior period financial statements in Note 1.

Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.(b) Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current presentation. 31Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II2012 vs. 2011 Results of OperationsRevenueCSX full year results reflect a 1% year-over-year volume decline as lower coal shipments were partially offset by growth in intermodal and automotive volume. Pricing gains and higher fuel recovery drove increases in revenue per unit in all markets. MerchandiseAgriculturalAgricultural Products - Volume decreased due to reduced shipments of corn and ethanol. Corn shipments for animal feed declined as drought conditions in the Midwest impacted harvest levels and drove corn prices higher. Further contributing to this decline, customers in the Southeast took advantage of lower cost imported grains and a strong local crop, both of which are transported by truck. Ethanol shipments declined as a result of higher corn prices and reduced gasoline demand.Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume was flat year-over-year. Fertilizer shipments were lower in the first half of the year as the expectation of moderating prices resulted in delayed purchases by farmers. This decline in the first half was offset by growth in fertilizer in the second half resulting from low river levels that shifted business that traditionally moves on barge to rail. Additionally, producers advanced shipments of fertilizer in the fourth quarter in anticipation of an expected increased application by farmers in 2013. Food and Consumer - Volume declined year-over-year. Appliance shipments were lower due to intermodal conversions, lower sales incentives by manufacturers and a moderating economy. The decline in appliances was partially offset by growth in refrigerated products due to highway-to-rail conversions.IndustrialChemicals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in energy-related markets (that include frac sand, LPG and crude oil) due to the increase in shale drilling activity. Additionally, plastics shipments grew to support growth predominately in automotive and packaging. Automotive - Volume grew as North American light vehicle production increased 17% to meet pent up demand as the average vehicle age in the U.S. reached record highs.Metals - Volume was slightly lower primarily due to the decline in scrap shipments as a result of lower steel mill utilization rates and lower scrap exports driven by moderating global demand.Housing and ConstructionMinerals - Volume declined due to reduced shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) resulting from the completion of several construction projects versus the prior year. Additionally, shipments of salt declined in the early part of 2012 as inventories remained high due to reduced road application during the previous mild winter. 32Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIWaste and Equipment - Volume declines were led by reduced shipments of military and machinery equipment which were negatively impacted by the expiration of the federal tax credit on the production of wind energy machinery. Additionally, waste shipments decreased as several customer remediation projects were completed. Forest Products - Volume increased in building products due to recovering demand for housing and construction, which was partially offset by a decline in the paper markets affected by electronic media substitution.CoalShipments of utility coal declined primarily driven by low natural gas prices, which drove displacement of coal at utilities served by CSX. In addition, utility stockpiles remained well above target levels and overall electric generation in the eastern U.S. declined. Utility coal declines were partially offset by higher export shipments driven by increased shipments of U.S. thermal coal. In 2012, CSX shipped 47.8 million tons of export coal.IntermodalIntermodal volume increased due to growth in both domestic and international markets. Domestic shipment growth resulted from highway-to-rail conversions and increased demand from both new and existing customers. International growth was driven by a new customer and expanded service offerings primarily enabled by the Northwest Ohio terminal. ExpensesIn 2012, total expenses decreased $26 million compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $53 million due to the following:•Incentive compensation expense decreased $55 million reflecting lower expected award payouts.•Crew labor costs decreased $42 million as a result of the decline in volume as well as efficiencies gained from management's action to reduce resources. • These decreases were partially offset by increased costs of $44 million primarily driven by wage inflation and increased pension and other post-employment benefit expense.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities as well as professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expense decreased by $73 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by the following:•Gains recognized increased $102 million year-over-year, primarily related to the additional recognition of the deferred gain from the prior year sale of an operating corridor to the state of Florida of $80 million. •Continued improvement in safety trends lowered casualty expenses by $19 million. 33Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II•Various other costs also decreased $17 million.•As a result of efficiency initiatives and the decline in volume, expenses decreased $12 million primarily related to lower material and repair costs due to the reduction of active locomotives.•Partially offsetting the above decreases in expenses were inflation of $47 million and a few costly derailments of $30 million, although the number of train accidents continued to decline. Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Overall, fuel expense increased $4 million due to a 4% increase in average price per gallon for locomotive fuel, partially offset by decreased volume and improved network efficiency. •Average fuel price per gallon increased $0.12 to $3.18 in 2012 versus 2011, which drove fuel expense $60 million higher versus the prior year. •Partially offsetting this increase is $56 million of savings related to decreased volume, improved network efficiency, fuel saving initiatives and the decline in non-locomotive fuel.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $83 million due to the following items:•A larger asset base related to higher capital spending drove expenses $66 million higher versus 2011.• A prior year favorable adjustment to asset retirements and other of $17 million was not repeated in 2012.Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses increased $13 million primarily due to the following:•Higher automotive volume-related costs increased expenses by $24 million. •Various other costs increased $33 million.•These increases were partially offset by savings of $44 million associated with improved asset utilization. Interest expense increased $14 million to $566 million primarily due to higher average debt balances partially offset by lower interest rates. The primary use of proceeds from the 2012 debt issuances was for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness due in both 2012 and early 2013 as well as a contribution to the Company's qualified pension plans.Other income - net increased $51 million to $73 million primarily related to a gain on the sale of a non-operating real estate.Income tax expense increased $22 million to $1.1 billion primarily due to higher earnings during 2012 and the cycling of prior year state income tax related adjustments.Net earnings increased $9 million to $1.9 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $0.12 to $1.79 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share. 34Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIOperating Statistics (Estimated) Fiscal Years 2013 2012 Improvement/(Decline)Safety and Service Measurements FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index0.86 0.70 (23)% FRA Train Accident Rate1.83 2.08 12 %On-Time Train Originations89% 89% — %On-Time Destination Arrivals81% 80% 1 %Dwell22.2 23.7 6 %Cars-On-Line182,266 189,994 4 %Train Velocity23.2 22.7 2 % Increase/ (Decrease)Resources Route Miles20,814 20,828 — %Locomotives (owned and long-term leased)4,259 4,178 2 %Freight Cars (owned and long-term leased)68,008 69,126 (2)%Containers (owned and long-term leased)17,569 17,927 (2)%Key Performance Measures DefinitionsFRA Personal Injury Frequency Index - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours.FRA Train Accident Rate - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.On-Time Train Originations - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.On-Time Destination Arrivals - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to two hours late (30 minutes for intermodal trains).Dwell - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival at and departure from the yard.

The Company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training, innovation and investment. For example, the Company's safety and train accident prevention programs rely on the latest tools, programs and employee participation that strengthen the safety culture in a supportive environment that allows each employee to be successful at CSX. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance. CSX safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can impact employees, customers and the communities we serve. CSX has continuously pursued safety improvements in all aspects of its operations and has enhanced efforts to educate communities on rail-related hazards. For example, CSX’s “Play It Safe” campaign uses electronic and print media to stress the importance of staying safe around trains and tracks. The Company uses sponsorship of NASCAR and NCAA basketball to capture the attention of targeted demographic groups. In addition, the Company routinely collaborates with the FRA and industry organizations as well as federal, state and local governments on the development and implementation of safety programs and initiatives. 35Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II At CSX, operational success is built on employee commitment to maintaining a constant focus on safety. During 2013, the FRA reportable personal injury frequency index increased 23 percent year over year to 0.86 and underscores the need for continued progress. However, CSX continues to remain a leader in a very safe industry. The reported FRA train accident frequency rate improved 12 percent year over year to 1.83 reflecting continued momentum in accident reduction. Network reliability and service metrics continued to show year over year improvements during 2013. While on-time originations remained flat at 89 percent, on-time arrivals improved 1 percent to 81 percent, average train velocity increased 2 percent to 23.2 miles per hour and dwell improved 6 percent to 22.2 hours.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed.Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash FlowsConsolidated Balance SheetsCSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend improvement and share repurchases.Total assets increased $1.1 billion from prior year primarily due to the increase in net properties of $1.2 billion resulting from capital investments. This increase was partially offset by the decline in cash and short-term investments of $292 million. Total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined increased $1.1 billion. This increase was primarily due to net earnings of $1,864 million and the increase in deferred income taxes of $566 million primarily related to accelerated tax depreciation as well as the tax impact of the unrecognized gain related to pension and other post-employment benefits plans which was recorded in 2013. Partially offsetting these increases were dividends paid of $600 million, share repurchases of $353 million and a net reduction in total debt of $277 million. Sources of CashThe Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2013, the Company generated $3.3 billion of cash from operating activities which increased $321 million from prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a $275 million contribution to the Company's qualified pension plans in the prior year that did not repeat. In 2012, the Company generated $2.9 billion of cash from operating activities which decreased $545 million from the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by a pension plan contribution as mentioned above, higher payments for income taxes as well as payments related to the ratification of labor agreements in 2012. Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in September 2016. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. 36Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICSX filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 15, 2013. This shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.Uses of CashCSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2013 and 2012, net cash used in investing activities was driven by $2.3 billion of property additions for both years. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

These investments are for projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. Planned capital investments for 2014 are expected to be $2.3 billion, including expected spending of approximately $300 million for PTC. This $2.3 billion excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year. Over half of the 2014 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. The remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives, freight cars, and high return projects that support long-term profitable growth and productivity initiatives that improve the returns of the business, such as intermodal terminal capacity projects. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations. Over the long term, the Company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC. CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be at least $1.7 billion. This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. Total PTC spending through 2013 was $875 million. 37Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIIn addition to capital investments, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases, share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders. In 2013, net cash used in financing activities was $1,232 million, which was an increase in spending of $564 million. This increase was driven by higher debt repayments and a lower amount of debt issued, partially offset by lower share repurchases. In 2012, net cash used in financing activities was $668 million, which was a decrease in spending of $745 million. Share repurchases were lower by $830 million and partially offsetting this were higher dividend payments of $78 million as a result of an increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.12 to $0.14 per share in second quarter 2012. CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Liquidity and Working CapitalCurrently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $1.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX has a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility expires in September 2016 and as of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. Additionally in 2013, CSX issued a total of $500 million of new long-term debt. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock and dividends to shareholders. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements. The Company's $250 million receivables securitization facility has a 364-day term and expires in December 2014. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity. The Company anticipates either renewing the facility or replacing it with another liquidity-based solution. Under the terms of this facility, CSXT transfers eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX services the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. In the event CSX Trade Receivables draws under this facility, the Company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility.Working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $178 million and $308 million at December 2013 and 2012, respectively. This decline since the prior year is primarily due to cash used for capital investments, dividends paid, share repurchases and long-term debt repaid which more than offset cash from operations. Also, see sources and uses of cash description above.The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. 38Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICredit Ratings Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings have improved during 2013. Currently, CSX is rated BBB+ with a stable outlook by S&P and Baa2 with a stable outlook by Moody's, compared to a rating of BBB with a positive outlook by S&P and Baa2 with a stable outlook by Moody's at December 2012. Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.SCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTSThe following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other significant commitments: Type of Obligation20142015201620172018ThereafterTotal(Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations Total Debt (See Note 9)$533$629$22$631$619$7,121$9,555Interest on Debt5474984784564155,5527,946Purchase Obligations (See Note 7)6133192602382261,3673,023Other Post-Employment Benefits (See Note 8) (a)5250494746204448Operating Leases - Net (See Note 7) (b)5146372819118299Agreements with Conrail (b)2525252525144269Total Contractual Obligations$1,821$1,567$871$1,425$1,350$14,506$21,540Other Commitments (c)$13622228$152(a)Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans which are unfunded. No amounts are included for funded pension obligations as no contributions are currently required.(b)Agreements with Conrail represent minimum future lease payments of $269 million under the shared asset area agreements (see Note 12, Related Party Transactions). These amounts plus total operating leases-net of $299 million above equals total net lease commitments of $568 million disclosed in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.(c)Other commitments of $152 million consisted of surety bonds, letters of credit, uncertain tax positions and public private partnerships. Surety bonds of $71 million and letters of credit of $39 million arise from assurances issued by a third-party that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement. Uncertain tax positions of $23 million which include interest and penalties are all included in year 2014. The year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated, however, the Company believes at least $3 million of these unrecognized tax benefits will be resolved in the next 12 months. Contractual commitments related to public-private partnerships are $19 million. 39Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSFor detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:•casualty, environmental and legal reserves;•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and•income taxes. Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves CasualtyCasualty reserves of $280 million in 2013 represent accruals for personal injury, occupational injury and asbestos claims. The Company's self-insured retention amount for these claims is $50 million per occurrence. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Company's self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC""), to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent third-party estimates, which are reviewed by management. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. Most of the Company's casualty claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, there were no significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust casualty reserves. 40Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedPersonal Injury Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”). In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm quarterly and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience.During 2013 and 2012, there were no significant changes in estimates in personal injury reserves. Adjustments to the reserves are included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.Occupational & AsbestosOccupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as “irritants”) and diesel fuels (like exhaust fumes) or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss.The Company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. Other types of exposures, however, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business. Diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods (amount of time between exposure to asbestos and the onset of the disease) which can range from 10 to 40 years after exposure.Occupational and asbestos claims are analyzed by a third-party actuary or specialist (the ""third-party specialist""), respectively, in order to determine the number of unasserted or incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Occupational claims analyses are performed by the third-party specialist quarterly and are reviewed by management. Since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated, management reviews asserted asbestos claims quarterly and the review by the third-party specialist is completed annually. With the exception of carpal tunnel, management has determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which unasserted claim filings and claim values can be estimated. Carpal tunnel claims use a three-year period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries.The third-party specialists analyze CSXT’s historical claim filings, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for occupational and asbestos claims reserves. The potentially exposed population is estimated by using CSX's employment records and industry data. From this analysis, the third-party specialists provide an estimate of the IBNR claims liability. 41Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedThe estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims.During 2013 and 2012, there were no significant changes in estimates recorded to adjust occupational or asbestos reserves. Adjustments in reserves are included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.Environmental Environmental reserves were $100 million for 2013. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 244 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.In accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:•type of clean-up required;•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location. These recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries. Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. 42Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedCurrently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the cost of remedial actions currently required.LegalIn accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan AccountingThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. As of December 2013, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans were $2.7 billion and $350 million, respectively. During 2012, the Company made a contribution of $275 million to its qualified pension plans, of which $25 million was the required minimum contribution. At this time, the Company anticipates that no further contributions to its qualified pension plans will be required in 2014.In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Prior to 2011, the post-retirement medical plan was partially funded by all participating retirees, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. Beginning in 2011, Medicare-eligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Non-Medicare eligible retirees are covered by a self-insured program partially funded by participating retirees. The life insurance plan is non-contributory.For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans. 43Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedThe accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;•long-term rate of return on plan assets;•salary scale inflation rates; and•other assumptions.The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. The Company reviews the discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, salary scale inflation rates and other assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate.Discount Rates Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2013 pension and post-retirement obligations are 4.75% and 4.25%, respectively. For 2012, the discount rate used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations was 3.75% and 3.20%, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2013, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years, respectively.Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its pension obligation was 7.50% and 7.75% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. 44Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedSalary Scale Inflation Rates Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 3.75% to value its 2013 and 2012 pension obligations.Other AssumptionsThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are selected by management.2014 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement ExpenseNet pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2014 is expected to be approximately $58 million and $21 million, respectively, compared to $95 million and $29 million, respectively, in 2013. The decrease in pension expense is primarily related to an increase in the discount rate and favorable asset experience.The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries and health care costs on the 2013 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:(Dollars in Millions)Pension OPEB Discount Rate 1% change$17 $2Long-term Rate of Return 1% change$22 N/ASalary Inflation 1% change$8 N/ADepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life MethodThe Company depreciates its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise over 86% of total fixed assets of $37 billion on a gross basis at December 2013. All other assets of the Company are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life.The Company currently utilizes more than 130 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method of accounting. Examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets. All assets of the Company are depreciated on a time or life basis. 45Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedThe Company believes the group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g., track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets.Under the group-life method of accounting, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management's assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study (also referred to as a life study) is the periodic review of asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets every three years and for road (e.g. bridges and signals) and track (e.g., rail, ties and ballast) assets every six years. In 2012, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets and a technical update (an update to the prior depreciation study) for its road and track assets. The Company plans to perform a road and track asset depreciation study during 2014. The Company believes the frequency currently required by the STB provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets.Changes in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations.There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;•evaluation of current operations;•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;•previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use;•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. As individual assets within a specific group are retired, resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation. As part of the depreciation study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study. Since the overall assumption with group-life is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time. 46Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedIn the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales, resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately. These acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred. Examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage (e.g., major hurricanes), the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets (e.g., disposal of all refrigerated freight cars).Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $1.1 billion and $1 billion for 2013 and 2012, respectively. A 1% change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $10 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. Income TaxesCSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2011. The federal income tax return for 2012 is currently under review. During 2013, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax year 2013. Management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2013, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $23 million.New Accounting Pronouncements and Change in Accounting PolicySee Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy.” 47Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the SEC, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements. The Company intends for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act may contain, among others, statements regarding: •projections and estimates of earnings, revenues, volumes, rates, cost-savings, expenses, taxes or other financial items;•expectations as to results of operations and operational initiatives;•expectations as to the effect of claims, lawsuits, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, labor negotiations or agreements on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity;•management's plans, strategies and objectives for future operations, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, safety and service performance, proposed new services and other matters that are not historical facts, and management's expectations as to future performance and operations and the time by which objectives will be achieved; and•future economic, industry or market conditions or performance and their effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as ""will,"" ""should,"" “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate,” “preliminary” and similar expressions. The Company cautions against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect its good faith beliefs with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to it as of the date the forward-looking statement is made. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the timing when, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual performance or results could differ materially from those anticipated by any forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. If the Company does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be drawn that the Company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements. The following important factors, in addition to those discussed in Part II, Item 1A (Risk Factors) and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements: •legislative, regulatory or legal developments involving transportation, including rail or intermodal transportation, the environment, hazardous materials, taxation, and initiatives to further regulate the rail industry;•the outcome of litigation, claims and other contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge, environmental matters, taxes, shipper and rate claims subject to adjudication, personal injuries and occupational illnesses; 48Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART II•changes in domestic or international economic, political or business conditions, including those affecting the transportation industry (such as the impact of industry competition, conditions, performance and consolidation) and the level of demand for products carried by CSXT;•natural events such as severe weather conditions, including floods, fire, hurricanes and earthquakes, a pandemic crisis affecting the health of the Company's employees, its shippers or the consumers of goods, or other unforeseen disruptions of the Company's operations, systems, property or equipment;•competition from other modes of freight transportation, such as trucking and competition and consolidation within the transportation industry generally; •the cost of compliance with laws and regulations that differ from expectations (including those associated with Positive Train Control implementation) and costs, penalties and operational impacts associated with noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations;•the impact of increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas, including potential effects of high speed rail initiatives, or regulatory changes affecting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes;•unanticipated conditions in the financial markets that may affect timely access to capital markets and the cost of capital, as well as management's decisions regarding share repurchases; •changes in fuel prices, surcharges for fuel and the availability of fuel;•the impact of natural gas prices on coal-fired electricity generation;•availability of insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or insufficient insurance coverage to cover claims or damages;•the inherent business risks associated with safety and security, including the availability and vulnerability of information technology, adverse economic or operational effects from actual or threatened war or terrorist activities and any governmental response;•labor and benefit costs and labor difficulties, including stoppages affecting either the Company's operations or customers' ability to deliver goods to the Company for shipment;•the Company's success in implementing its strategic, financial and operational initiatives; •changes in operating conditions and costs or commodity concentrations; and•the inherent uncertainty associated with projecting economic and business conditions.Other important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified elsewhere in this report and in CSX's other SEC reports, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Company's website at www.csx.com. The information on the CSX website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K. 49Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.At December 2013, CSX had $7 million of floating rate debt obligations outstanding. A 1% fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause less than a $1 million change in interest expense. This amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical interest rate fluctuation on the balances of our floating rate debt at December 27, 2013. 50Table of ContentsCSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 8.

277948,CSX,CSX CORP,2015,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 6CSX CORPORATIONPART IItem 1A. Risk Factors The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices. Legislation passed by Congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business. For instance, several of the proposals under consideration by the STB could have a significant negative impact on the Company's ability to negotiate prices for the value of rail services provided and meet service standards, which could force a reduction in capital spending. In addition, statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies. For example, the RSIA mandated that the installation of PTC be completed by December 31, 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. Noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. Climate change and other emissions-related legislation and regulation could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. Climate change and other emissions-related legislation and regulation have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and is expected to issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner (particularly in the absence of similar regulations in other manufacturing countries). Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Capacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency. CSXT may experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased volume; (ii) locomotive or crew shortages; (iii) extreme weather conditions; (iv) increased passenger activities, including high-speed rail; or (v) regulatory changes impacting when CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes, which could have a negative effect on CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency. 7CSX CORPORATIONPART IGlobal economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight. A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure. For example, if the rate of economic growth in Asia slows or if European economies contract, U.S. export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for CSX. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives, railcars and other equipment, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on operations, financial condition and liquidity. Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Domestic energy production continues to evolve creating both opportunities and challenges for CSX. Increased production of crude oil from the new domestic oil fields, particularly those located in the Bakken Shale region of North Dakota, has created opportunities for CSX to transport crude oil by rail to East Coast refineries. Crude oil production from this region is subject to the volatility of global crude oil prices. Depressed crude oil prices due to increased supply or lower demand could result in a decrease in domestic crude oil production, which could have an adverse effect on crude oil volumes for CSX. In addition, new regulations related to the shipment of crude oil by rail, including proposed rail car safety standards, could increase costs for CSX, negatively impact network fluidity or have an adverse impact on customers. Over the past few years, production of natural gas in the U.S. has also increased dramatically, which has resulted in lower natural gas prices. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which could further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate. CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials. 8CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company. The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. The Company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. Such an event could result in increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.Disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs. The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports, adverse political developments or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted. 9CSX CORPORATIONPART IFailure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Most of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of Presidential intervention), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, or if terms of existing agreements are disputed, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. The Company faces competition from other transportation providers. The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations. Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage. The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations. 10CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. As part of its railroad operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the Company's insurance coverage. Additionally, the Company is subject to adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates. The unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, the Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments as well as on bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone 11CSX CORPORATIONPART IItem 2. Properties The Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern cities of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.CSXT’s track structure includes main thoroughfares, connecting terminals and yards (known as mainline track), track within terminals and switching yards, track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains, track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles are greater than CSXT’s approximately 21,000 route miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads. At December 2014, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track MilesMainline track26,391Terminals and switching yards9,397Passing sidings and turnouts923Total36,711In addition to its physical track structure, CSXT operates numerous yards and terminals. These serve as hubs between CSXT and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars often are received, re-sorted and placed onto new outbound trains. The Company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume (number of railcars or intermodal containers processed) are listed below:Yards and TerminalsAnnualVolume(number of units processed)Chicago, IL1,039,431Waycross, GA648,206Selkirk, NY578,414Willard, OH550,170Cincinnati, OH534,214Indianapolis, IN532,368Nashville, TN482,932Hamlet, NC457,251Louisville, KY387,614Toledo, OH376,261 12CSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork Geography CSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent, high-speed intermodal, automotive and merchandise service. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries consumer goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, coal and intermodal.Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia, and provides access to major eastern ports.Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. CSXT’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Almost half the tons of export coal and nearly all of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity.See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network. 13CSX CORPORATIONPART ICSX Rail Network 14CSX CORPORATIONPART ILocomotives CSXT owns and long-term leases more than 4,000 locomotives, over which 98% are owned by CSXT. From time to time, the Company also short-term leases locomotives based on business needs. Freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull trains. Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar is attached to the right train in order to deliver it to its final destination. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. At December 2014, CSXT’s fleet of owned and long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following types of locomotives: Locomotives % Average Age(years)Freight3,719 87% 21Switching329 8% 35Auxiliary Units209 5% 22Total4,257 100% 21 Equipment In 2014, the average daily fleet of cars on line consisted of approximately 203,000 cars. At any time over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by the Company. Examples of these non-CSXT railcars are as follows: railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service) and multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared among railroads). The Company’s revenue generating equipment (either owned or long-term leased) consists of freight cars and containers as described below. Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions.Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine. Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers.Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles.Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.Containers – Weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight. Other cars on the network consist primarily of refrigerated boxcars for transporting perishable items. 15CSX CORPORATIONPART I At December 2014, the Company’s owned and long-term leased equipment consisted of the following:EquipmentNumber of Units %Gondolas25,275 38%Open-top hoppers11,555 17%Multi-level flat cars11,455 17%Covered hoppers10,153 16%Box cars7,569 11%Flat cars690 1%Other cars315 —%Subtotal freight cars67,012 100%Containers17,284 Total equipment84,296 Item 3.

The Company references the Standard & Poor 500 Stock Index (“S&P 500”), which is a registered trademark of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and the Dow Jones U.S. Transportation Average Index, which provide comparisons to a broad-based market index and other companies in the transportation industry. As shown in the graph, CSX's five-year stock returns significantly outpaced those of the S&P 500. 19CSX CORPORATIONPART IICSX Purchases of Equity SecuritiesCSX is required to disclose any purchases of its own common stock for the most recent quarter. CSX purchases its own shares for two primary reasons: (1) to further its goals under its share repurchase program and (2) to fund the Company’s contribution required to be paid in CSX common stock under a 401(k) plan that covers certain union employees. In April 2013, the Company announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by April 2015. Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances. During 2014 and 2013, CSX repurchased $517 million, or 17 million shares, and $353 million, or 14 million shares, respectively, of common stock under this program. Share repurchase activity of $129 million for the fourth quarter 2014 was as follows: CSX Purchases of Equity Securities for the Quarter Fourth Quarter (a)Total Number of Shares PurchasedAverage Price Paid per ShareTotal Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or ProgramsBeginning Balance $259,283,292 October1,294,275$32.091,293,900 217,766,633 November1,165,60035.611,165,300 176,267,691 December1,258,60036.261,258,600 130,625,331 Ending Balance3,718,475$34.613,717,800 $130,625,331(a) Fourth quarter 2014 consisted of the following fiscal periods: October (September 27, 2014 - October 24, 2014), November (October 25, 2014 - November 21, 2014), and December (November 22, 2014 - December 26, 2014).(b) The difference of 675 shares between the ""Total Number of Shares Repurchase"" and the ""Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs"" for the quarter represents shares purchased to fund the Company's contribution to a 401(k) plan that covers certain union employees. 20CSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 6.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSTRATEGIC OVERVIEW CSX provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations with its approximately 32,000 dedicated employees. The Company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the economic success and improved global competitiveness of the United States. This improved competitiveness is driven by lower natural gas prices, increased foreign labor costs and supply chain factors. The rail industry benefits from this improved global competitiveness, continued economic growth and the shift towards more rail-based solutions. U.S. demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise and freight railroads provide the most environmentally efficient and economical means to meet this growing demand. CSX can move a ton of freight about 450 miles on one gallon of diesel fuel, as trains are four times more fuel efficient than trucks on average. Shipping freight by rail also alleviates highway congestion, eases air pollution and saves energy.CSX's network reaches nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population, which accounts for the majority of the nation's consumption of goods. Through this network, the Company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the country's needs. These products range from agricultural goods, such as grains, to chemicals, automobiles, metals, building materials, paper, consumer products, and energy sources like coal, ethanol and crude oil. The Company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business: merchandise, intermodal and coal. CSX's transportation solutions connect industries and population centers across the United States with each other and with global markets through access to over 70 port facilities whereby meeting the transportation needs of energy producers, manufacturers, industrial producers, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers and the United States Armed Forces.Operating InitiativesTo support long-term growth, CSX is focused on meeting customers’ needs while improving profitability. Several key operating initiatives have been implemented over the past several years that lay a foundation for meeting these objectives. The overall goal is sustained high customer service levels, which is in part achieved through a relentless focus on using advanced network modeling analytics and tools to create a disciplined, scheduled approach to designing and running CSX's network. The Company continues to identify the most efficient, cost-effective routes for CSXT customers' traffic while providing timely service with the fewest handlings and car miles possible.Through the Service Excellence initiative, CSX is building a culture that engages all employees and focuses on the value delivered to customers through improved service. This initiative increases employee communication and dialogue to help identify and resolve customer issues at the lowest level, improving the customer experience and allowing CSX to grow the business. This process involves engagement from all operating employees, as well as collaboration with sales and marketing employees and, ultimately, with the Company’s customers. Higher levels of customer service and satisfaction support CSX’s ability to profitably grow the business by increasing customer retention, price sustainability and asset utilization. 22CSX CORPORATIONPART IIIn addition, Total Service Integration (“TSI”) is intended to align operating capabilities with customers' needs to reduce loading and unloading times and create more capacity. TSI was first implemented on the unit train network, where it has successfully increased the average number of cars per train and improved asset utilization. CSX is implementing TSI for the carload network, which focuses on improving the “first and last mile” service experience for carload customers, providing a more consistent and reliable service product. The carload network is connected to more than 5,000 customer facilities and has a high degree of variability each day. New tools and technology are allowing the company to more effectively communicate with customers, not only providing the service the Company has promised to deliver but proactively notifying the customer of service status. Applying TSI to the carload network will improve service consistency for each merchandise shipper.Finally, Enterprise Asset Management (“EAM”) focuses on improving the utilization of the company’s most critical assets, namely, crews, locomotives, cars and track infrastructure. Projects are currently in place to deploy technology, improve processes and reduce unproductive time. Because the railroad is an asset intensive industry, EAM helps reduce the overall expense associated with asset ownership by monitoring the overall condition of equipment, helping proactively schedule maintenance, increasing utilization and also effectively managing the investment required for new or replacement assets. By improving asset utilization, CSX expects to sustain long-term operating efficiencies and reduce future capital expenditures associated with asset replacement.In summary, these initiatives are designed to improve service levels in a cost effective manner and enhance the reliability of rail transportation. These improvements to operational processes, customer communication and service are better aligning CSX's operating capabilities with customers' needs and are enabling the Company to capitalize on the growth opportunities described below.Strategic Growth OpportunitiesIntermodalCSX’s intermodal business is an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck. CSX’s intermodal network connects all major population centers east of the Mississippi River and is over 90% cleared for the use of double-stack (two containers high) intermodal movements. This positions the Company to capture a significant share of the incremental domestic intermodal market opportunity, estimated at nine million truckloads in the eastern United States that move over 550 miles. The Company’s highway-to-rail initiatives assist in capturing this traffic and also help customers identify conversion opportunities for both domestic moves and the U.S. portion of international moves.CSX is also building new terminals and increasing network capacity to broaden its market presence in key growth areas. The Company's Northwest Ohio intermodal terminal, which started operations in 2011 and was expanded in 2014, is part of the National Gateway Initiative discussed below. This high-capacity terminal expands service offerings to customers, improves market access to and from east coast ports, reduces interchanges in Chicago and enhances the fluidity of the network. During 2014, the Company opened terminals in Winter Haven, FL and Quebec, Canada. The Company expects to begin construction on a new terminal near Pittsburgh, PA in 2015 enhancing the Company’s intermodal reach and supporting future growth. 23CSX CORPORATIONPART IIIllinois Basin Coal ShiftEnergy markets have shifted over the past few years and continue to evolve. In spite of declines in domestic utility coal consumption over the last few years, CSX coal volumes have recently grown as a result of colder winter weather. In the longer term, downward pressure on domestic coal volumes could resume as the result of increasingly stringent proposed environmental regulations and continued low natural gas prices. In addition, mining economics are causing a shift from Central Appalachian coal to thermal coal in the Illinois Basin and the Powder River Basin. To capitalize on these shifts, CSX continues to enhance its network to support these changes, such as adding sidings (track which enables trains on the same line to pass) and increasing yard capacity. Export CoalCSX export coal volume and pricing is subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy, competition from foreign coal producers and regulatory shifts. Over the past few years, CSX has capitalized on the global coal demand in both steel manufacturing and power generation. Currently, both global thermal and metallurgical coal prices are low due to oversupply, but CSX sees long-term growth in global demand as developing countries become more urbanized. The Company remains opportunistic based on the global markets and the resulting level of demand. In addition to the Company’s ready access to large U.S. coal suppliers and multiple port facilities, CSX expects to continue to enhance the operating efficiency of its export coal network which will favorably position the Company to capitalize on growth as it is made available.New Energy Markets The ongoing surge in shale drilling for the extraction of oil and natural gas has created the opportunity for CSX to serve new energy markets such as crude oil, liquefied petroleum gases (“LPG”), frac sand and other related materials. For example, CSX is capitalizing on the opportunity to move the growing supply of crude oil from the new domestic oil fields, particularly those located in the Bakken Shale region of North Dakota, to customers at eastern refineries. This service also provides greater flexibility in source locations as compared to pipelines. CSX’s LPG market is also benefiting from drilling in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia within the Utica shale region. Midstream energy companies, which are involved in the transportation, storage and wholesale of refined petroleum products, are taking advantage of the abundance of inexpensive wet gas with newly constructed gas processing plants (or “fractionators”) in the region. Rail will also play a vital role in moving LPG products from the fractionators to the market.CSX’s frac sand market (a key input in the drilling process) has also expanded rapidly over the last few years. The Company has invested in new operating capacity, such as railcars and terminals, to accommodate this growth, which has been concentrated mainly in the region of the Utica shale and the western Marcellus shale (which covers most of western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia). The CSX network not only provides access to many frac sand transload terminals located near the drilling activity but also offers the advantage of CSX-direct routes from several key sand producing regions to the frac sand terminals.Over the longer term, the improved energy supply outlook for the U.S. will create a sustainable competitive advantage for domestic chemical producers and generate additional growth opportunities for rail. Since natural gas is the primary component in the production of a wide range of petrochemicals, the supply growth and the resulting lower prices have now placed the U.S. amongst the lowest cost production regions in the world. This increased competitiveness is sparking significant investment in new U.S. chemical industry capacity for the first time in more than a decade. CSX is well-positioned to participate in this growing chemical business over the next several years. 24CSX CORPORATIONPART IIPublic-Private PartnershipsExpanding capacity on U.S. rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation, increased business activity at U.S. ports, reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions. Therefore, CSX and its government partners are jointly working to invest in multi-year rail infrastructure projects such as the National Gateway. This initiative is a public-private partnership which will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest for double-stack intermodal trains. As part of the National Gateway project, CSX expects to break ground on the modernization of the Virginia Avenue Tunnel in Washington, D.C. in 2015.This project will improve the flow of freight traffic through the District of Columbia and will eliminate a rail-traffic bottleneck that also impacts commuter and passenger trains in the region. The new structure will provide double-stack train clearances in Maryland, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Going forward, CSX will continue to explore other opportunities to partner with the public sector to maximize the many public benefits of freight rail.Balanced Approach to Cash Deployment CSX remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business, dividend growth and share repurchases. In 2014, the Company invested $2.4 billion to further enhance the capacity, quality, safety and flexibility of its network. In addition, CSX continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During 2014, the Company announced a 7 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per common share. The Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 12 times over the last nine years which represents a 27 percent compounded annual growth rate. Also in 2014, CSX continued share repurchases under its $1 billion program which began in 2013 and is expected to be completed in 2015 based on market and business decisions. CSX repurchased $517 million, or 17 million shares, during 2014 under this program. Since 2006, CSX has repurchased 493 million shares (adjusted for stock splits) for $8.8 billion, which represents about one-half of total shares outstanding. As part of this balanced approach, the Company is committed to maintaining a credit profile consistent with a BBB+ rating by Standard & Poor’s and a Baa1 rating by Moody’s Investment Services.SummaryThese operating initiatives, strategic growth areas, long-term investments and shareholder returns discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth, productivity improvement, enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations. To continue these types of investments, the Company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value. CSX will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the Company's rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies. 25CSX CORPORATIONPART II2014 HIGHLIGHTS• Revenue of $12.7 billion increased $643 million or 5% year over year driven by 6% volume growth across nearly all markets.• Expenses of $9.1 billion increased $503 million or 6% year over year primarily as a result of volume-related costs, inflation and network performance costs. • Operating income of $3.6 billion increased $140 million or 4%.• Operating ratio of 71.5% increased 40 basis points from 71.1%.•Earnings per diluted share of $1.92 increased $0.09 or 5%.

Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principle reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. As described below, free cash flow before dividends increased $24 million year over year to $919 million. The primary reason for the increase in free cash flow from the prior year is primarily due to the following:•Higher operating income of $140 million•Lower taxes paid of $83 million •Partially offsetting these increases were higher property additions of $136 millionThe following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure).

These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. 27CSX CORPORATIONPART IIRESULTS OF OPERATIONS2014 vs. 2013 Results of Operations Fiscal Years 2014 2013 $ Change % Change(Dollars in Millions) Revenue$12,669 $12,026 $643 5 %Expense Labor and Fringe3,377 3,138 (239) (8)Materials, Supplies and Other2,484 2,275 (209) (9)Fuel1,616 1,656 40 2Depreciation1,151 1,104 (47) (4)Equipment and Other Rents428 380 (48) (13)Total Expense9,056 8,553 (503) (6)Operating Income3,613 3,473 140 4Interest Expense(545) (562) 17 3Other Income - Net(24) 11 (35) (318)Income Tax Expense(1,117) (1,058) (59) (6)Net Earnings$1,927 $1,864 $63 3Earnings Per Diluted Share: Net Earnings$1.92 $1.83 $0.09 5 %Operating Ratio71.5% 71.1% (40) bpsVolume and Revenue (Unaudited)Volume (Thousands of units); Revenue (Dollars in Millions); Revenue Per Unit (Dollars) Volume Revenue Revenue Per Unit 2014 2013 % Change 2014 2013 % Change 2014 2013 % ChangeAgricultural Agricultural Products419 390 7 % $1,130 $1,013 12 % $2,697 $2,597 4 %Phosphates and Fertilizers330 327 1 534 527 1 1,618 1,612 —Food and Consumer94 96 (2) 265 269 (1) 2,819 2,802 1Industrial Chemicals620 532 17 2,178 1,896 15 3,513 3,564 (1)Automotive435 432 1 1,213 1,217 — 2,789 2,817 (1)Metals276 262 5 701 644 9 2,540 2,458 3Housing and Construction Forest Products307 298 3 819 775 6 2,668 2,601 3Minerals293 275 7 459 432 6 1,567 1,571 —Waste and Equipment158 150 5 309 264 17 1,956 1,760 11Total Merchandise2,932 2,762 6 7,608 7,037 8 2,595 2,548 2Coal1,262 1,195 6 2,849 2,895 (2) 2,258 2,423 (7)Intermodal2,728 2,582 6 1,790 1,697 5 656 657 —Other— — — 422 397 6 — — —Total6,922 6,539 6 % $12,669 $12,026 5 % $1,830 $1,839 — % 28CSX CORPORATIONPART II2014 vs. 2013 Results of Operations RevenueVolume increased 6% year over year with growth across most markets. Revenue increased by 5% year over year driven by this broad-based volume growth.MerchandiseAgriculturalAgricultural Products - Volume growth was driven by increased shipments of grain and ethanol. A combined record corn and soybean crop in 2013 led to higher grain shipments and reduced U.S. corn prices resulting in increased ethanol production in 2014.Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume growth was driven by increased shipments of finished fertilizer products to replenish inventories and phosphate rock shipments due to capacity at a customer facility returning to normal levels.Food and Consumer - Volume declined due to lower shipments of canned goods and rice. The decline in canned goods was driven by market losses, while rice shipments were lower as customers substituted lower-priced corn. This decline was partially offset by growth in alcoholic beverage shipments due to a customer’s gain in market share.IndustrialChemicals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in energy-related shipments that included crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and frac sand. The rise in crude oil shipments to East Coast refineries was due to increased supply of low-cost crude oil from shale drilling activity. Automotive - Volume increased as North American light vehicle production grew, but rail equipment shortages due to network performance in early 2014 tempered this growth.Metals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in sheet steel shipments due to growth in automotive production and market gains.Housing and ConstructionForest Products -Volume increased due to increased shipments of building products and pulpboard. Building products was driven by the continued recovery in the residential housing market. Pulpboard shipments increased due to modal conversions and inventory replenishments that resulted from reduced production late last year.Minerals - Volume growth was driven by increased shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) and salt. Aggregates was driven by the continued recovery in construction activity, while salt shipments grew due to increased application of road salt and inventory replenishment as a result of the severe winter weather in early 2014.Waste and Equipment - Volume increased due to growth in machinery shipments of wind energy components and municipal solid waste shipments from a new service offering to a customer location. This growth was partially offset by lower industrial waste shipments due to the completion of one-time remediation projects. 29CSX CORPORATIONPART IICoalDomestic volume increased due to higher shipments attributable to higher natural gas prices, marketplace gains and utilities replenishing stockpiles. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in export coal as a result of softening global market conditions.IntermodalDomestic volume increased as a result of growth with existing customers and continued success with highway-to-rail conversions. International volume also increased due to growth with customers in global container shipments moving to inland destinations.Other Other revenue increased primarily due to higher incidental revenue associated with higher volume partially offset by decline in revenue from customers who did not meet minimum contractual volumes.ExpenseIn 2014, total expenses increased $503 million, or 6%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $239 million primarily due to the following items:•Volume-related costs were $71 million higher primarily due to increased workforce levels to capture strong customer demand. •Inflation was $67 million higher.•Labor costs were $49 million higher due to overtime and relief crews associated with weather disruptions earlier in the year and efforts to improve network performance.•An initial charge for $39 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of an initiative to reduce the management workforce.•Labor costs were $30 million higher due to an amended locomotive maintenance service agreement where CSX now provides oversight of the labor force. Outside service costs shifted from materials, supplies and other to labor and fringe. Overall expense is neutral for the year. •Other costs were $17 million lower primarily due to reduced pension costs and incentive compensation costs that reflect lower award payments.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal services at automotive facilities and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expenses increased$209 million primarily driven by the following:•Prior year real estate gains were $85 million. No gains were recognized in the current year.•Volume-related costs rose $58 million primarily due to increased resource levels in response to the 6% volume growth to help capture strong customer demand.•Utilities, materials and foreign locomotive costs were $44 million higher in response to weather-related service challenges earlier in the year and efforts to improve network performance.•Inflation was $39 million higher.•Risk-related costs increased by $13 million due to higher derailments earlier in the year, which reflect the increase in the FRA train accident frequency rate. 30CSX CORPORATIONPART II•Partially offsetting these increases was the amended locomotive maintenance agreement which shifted $30 million to labor and fringe as referenced above.Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $40 million driven by the following:•Average fuel price per gallon decreased $0.22 to $2.95 per gallon versus the prior year which reduced expenses by $112 million. •Improved efficiency reduced expenses by $19 million.•Volume-related costs were $99 million higher.•Other fuel savings were $8 million.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $47 million primarily due to a larger asset base.Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $48 million driven by the following:•Car hire costs were $31 million higher due to volume, longer car cycle times and network performance.•Inflation resulted in $18 million of additional costs related to rates on automotive, intermodal and coal cars.•Other costs improved $1 million.Interest expense decreased $17 million to $545 million primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average debt balances.Other (expense) income - net decreased $35 million to an expense of $24 million primarily due to an increase in estimated environmental cleanup costs of $17 million related to non-operating activities as well as costs of $16 million associated with the early redemption of long-term debt.Income tax expense increased $59 million to $1.1 billion primarily due to higher earnings partially offset by favorable state legislative changes.Net earnings increased $63 million to $1.9 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.09 to $1.92 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share. 31CSX CORPORATIONPART II2013 vs. 2012 Results of Operations Fiscal Years 2013 2012 $ Change % Change(Dollars in Millions) Revenue$12,026 $11,763 $263 2 %Expense Labor and Fringe3,138 3,020 (118) (4)Materials, Supplies and Other2,275 2,156 (119) (6)Fuel1,656 1,672 16 1Depreciation1,104 1,059 (45) (4)Equipment and Other Rents380 392 12 3Total Expense8,553 8,299 (254) (3)Operating Income3,473 3,464 9 —Interest Expense(562) (566) 4 1Other Income - Net11 73 (62) (85)Income Tax Expense(1,058) (1,108) 50 5Net Earnings$1,864 $1,863 $1 —Earnings Per Diluted Share: Net Earnings$1.83 $1.79 $0.04 2 %Operating Ratio71.1% 70.6% (50) bpsVolume and Revenue (Unaudited)Volume (Thousands of units); Revenue (Dollars in Millions); Revenue Per Unit (Dollars) Volume Revenue Revenue Per Unit 2013 2012 % Change 2013 2012 % Change 2013 2012 % ChangeAgricultural Agricultural Products390 394 (1)% $1,013 $1,007 1 % $2,597 $2,556 2 %Phosphates and Fertilizers327 321 2 527 512 3 1,612 1,595 1Food and Consumer96 100 (4) 269 273 (1) 2,802 2,730 3Industrial Chemicals532 471 13 1,896 1,682 13 3,564 3,571 —Automotive432 425 2 1,217 1,154 5 2,817 2,715 4Metals262 263 — 644 635 1 2,458 2,414 2Housing and Construction Minerals275 270 2 432 409 6 1,571 1,515 4Waste and Equipment150 138 9 264 262 1 1,760 1,899 (7)Forest Products298 286 4 775 722 7 2,601 2,524 3Total Merchandise2,762 2,668 4 7,037 6,656 6 2,548 2,495 2Coal1,195 1,290 (7) 2,895 3,190 (9) 2,423 2,473 (2)Intermodal2,582 2,451 5 1,697 1,594 6 657 650 1Other— — — 397 323 23 — — —Total6,539 6,409 2 % $12,026 $11,763 2 % $1,839 $1,835 — % 32CSX CORPORATIONPART II2013 vs. 2012 Results of OperationsRevenueVolume increased 2% year-over-year as growth in merchandise and intermodal more than offset lower coal volume. Total revenue increased by 2% year-over-year driven by this volume growth, pricing gains across most markets offset by negative mix. MerchandiseAgriculturalAgricultural Products - Volume declined due to a reduction in shipments of feed grain and ethanol. Feed grain shipments were impacted by low supplier inventories caused by 2012’s drought and increased competition from imports. Ethanol shipments declined as a result of increased competition from imports, lower production and competitive losses.Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume growth was driven by the reopening of a customer mine that led to more short haul phosphates shipments that were previously sourced from an origin not located on CSX’s network.Food and Consumer - Volume declined due to a reduction in shipments of refrigerated products and alcoholic beverages. The decline in refrigerated products volume was driven by lower potato shipments as a result of more normalized production levels compared to the above-average yields in the prior year, while the decline in alcoholic beverages was primarily driven by a consolidation within a customer’s distribution network that resulted in lower shipments for CSX.IndustrialChemicals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in energy-related shipments that included crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas (""LPG"") and frac sand. The rise in crude oil shipments was due to increased supply of low-cost crude from shale drilling activity, resulting in new shipments to east coast refineries. Automotive - Finished vehicle shipments increased as North American light vehicle production grew year-over-year. This increase was partially offset by competitive losses in both automotive parts and finished vehicles.Metals - Volume was flat as a reduction in steel sheet shipments was offset by growth in aluminum products and steel plates. The reduction in shipments of steel sheet, which is used in automotive manufacturing, was driven by competitive losses, mill closures and source shifts. Shipments of aluminum product, which is used in a variety of products like packaging and construction, increased due to modal conversions. Shipments of steel plate, which is used in a wide range of end markets including construction, structural and energy applications, increased in support of continued growth in energy-related markets.Housing and ConstructionForest Products - Volume growth was led by an increase in building products due to the continued recovery of the residential housing market.Minerals - Volume growth was led by an increase in salt shipments due to modal conversions, new customer distribution terminals and inventory replenishment from more severe winter weather in early 2013 that resulted in more application of salt to roads. 33CSX CORPORATIONPART IIWaste and Equipment - Volume growth was led by waste shipments which were driven by an increase in construction debris due to the continued recovery in construction activity and large scale remediation projects.CoalExport declines were driven by decreased shipments of U.S. thermal coal, as a result of global oversupply and lower coal prices. Shipments of domestic coal declined due to continued low natural gas prices and utility stockpiles above target levels.IntermodalDomestic volume growth was driven by continued success with highway-to-rail conversions, growth with existing customers, and service product enhancements. International volume increased due to strength with existing customers and the cycling of disruptions resulting from Hurricane Sandy in the prior year.OtherOther revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from customers who did not meet minimum contractual volumes.ExpensesIn 2013, total expenses increased $254 million, or 3%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $118 million primarily due to the following items:•Incentive compensation costs were $89 million higher reflecting higher expected award payouts.•Inflation increased expenses $61 million.•Partially offsetting these increases were labor and other costs which decreased $32 million primarily related to improvements in network efficiencies that resulted from the overall reduction in employees, fewer crew starts as well as lower training expenses. Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities as well as professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expense increased $119 million primarily driven by the following:•Inflation increased expenses $42 million.•Risk-related costs increased $39 million primarily due to higher expenses related to derailment costs as well as prior year favorable casualty adjustments that did not repeat in 2013.•Volume, materials and services costs increased $19 million primarily due to increased expenses related to higher volume and resource levels.•Gains recognized decreased $19 million year over year. Gains from the prior year related to the sale of operating rail corridors to the state of Florida and to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts were $104 million. Gains in 2013 were $85 million for the sale of operating rail corridor to the state of Florida, a non-monetary exchange of easements and rail assets as well as a deferred gain recognized from a closure arrangement related to a prior conveyance of a formerly-owned company. 34CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $16 million driven by the following:•Improved network efficiency and fuel savings initiatives decreased expenses by $38 million.•Average fuel price per gallon decreased $0.05 to $3.17 per gallon versus the prior year which reduced expenses by $26 million.•Partially offsetting these decreases were volume-related costs of $31 million as well as other costs of $17 million which includes an adjustment to an interline fuel receivable.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $45 million primarily due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending.Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $12 million primarily due to improved asset utilization partially offset by increased rates and volume.Interest expense decreased $4 million to $562 million primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average debt balances.Other income - net decreased $62 million to $11 million primarily related to the prior year gain recognized on the sale of a non-operating property that was not repeated in the current year.Income tax expense decreased $50 million to $1.06 billion primarily due to the year-over-year decrease in earnings before income taxes as well as federal and state legislative changes.Net earnings increased $1 million to $1.86 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.04 to $1.83 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share. 35CSX CORPORATIONPART IIOperating Statistics (Estimated) Fiscal Years 2014 2013 Improvement/ (Deterioration)Safety and Service Measurements FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index0.95 0.90 (6)% FRA Train Accident Rate2.22 1.98 (12)%On-Time Train Originations56% 89% (37)%On-Time Destination Arrivals45% 81% (44)%Dwell26.3 22.2 (18)%Train Velocity20.1 23.2 (13)%Cars-On-Line (a)203,699 182,266 (12)% (a) Cars-on-line increased approximately 14,000 or 7.5% in 2014 due to a calculation error correction made by the American Association of Railroads in February 2014. This error impacted the industry cars-on-line since 2011. Previously reported amounts have not been adjusted to reflect this correction. Key Performance Measures DefinitionsFRA Personal Injury Frequency Index - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours.FRA Train Accident Rate - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.On-Time Train Originations - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.On-Time Destination Arrivals - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to two hours late (30 minutes for intermodal trains).Dwell - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival at and departure from the yard. It does not include cars moving through the yard on the same train. Train Velocity - Average train speed between terminals in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains).Cars-On-Line - An average count of all cars on the network (does not include locomotives, cabooses, trailers, containers or maintenance equipment). The Company measures and reports safety and service performance. The Company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training, innovation and investment. For example, the Company's safety and train accident prevention programs rely on the latest tools, programs and employee participation that strengthen the safety culture in a supportive environment that allows each employee to be successful at CSX. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance. CSX safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can impact employees, customers and the communities we serve. The Company consistently collaborates with the FRA and industry organizations as well as federal, state and local governments on the development and implementation of safety programs and initiatives. For example, earlier this year, CSX and other major freight railroads met with the U.S. Department of Transportation (""DOT"") and other key stakeholders to discuss potential safety enhancements to our nation’s freight railroad network. CSX, as part of a wider industry initiative, voluntarily committed to take specific long-term actions to increase its strong safety performance. CSX agreed to reduce the speed of certain trains to 40 miles per hour through high threat urban areas, increase the frequency of track inspections, and work collaboratively and proactively with local communities to address area-specific concerns. Furthermore, CSX partnered with Operation Lifesaver, Inc., the DOT and other major railroads in the Common Sense campaign to reduce the number of injuries and fatalities around the railroad right of way. CSXT continues an ongoing public safety program to clear-cut trees and vegetation at public passive highway-rail intersections (crossings with no flashing lights or gates) to improve the public's ability to discern rail activities. 36CSX CORPORATIONPART II At CSX, operational success is built on employee commitment to maintaining a constant focus on safety. During 2014, the FRA reportable personal injury frequency index worsened 6 percent year over year to 0.95. The reported FRA train accident frequency rate weakened 12 percent year over year to 2.22. Despite these results, CSX remains an industry leader in employee safety. Despite significant volume growth, the Company expects service to gradually improve to superior levels with the addition of strategic infrastructure investments, locomotives and operating employees coming online. On-time originations were 56 percent and on-time arrivals were 45 percent, which are both down versus 2013 but stabilized by the end of the year. Year over year, average train velocity declined 13 percent to 20.1 miles per hour and dwell worsened 18 percent to 26.3 hours.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed.Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash FlowsConsolidated Balance SheetsCSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend improvement and share repurchases.Total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $1.3 billion from prior year. The increase in assets was driven by higher net properties of $1.3 billion resulting from planned capital investments. The increase in total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined was driven by net earnings of $1.9 billion, higher pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities of $269 million mostly driven by lower discount rates and higher deferred income taxes of $196 million primarily related to accelerated tax depreciation. Partially offsetting these increases were dividends paid of $629 million and share repurchases of $517 million.Significant cash flowsThe following tables present net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2012, 2013 and 2014. 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012Dollars in millions201420132012 $ Var $ VarNet cash provided by operating activities$3,343$3,267$2,946 $76 $321Net cash used in investing activities$(2,183)$(2,227)$(2,277) $44 $50Net cash used in financing activities$(1,083)$(1,232)$(668) $149 $(564) 37CSX CORPORATIONPART IISources of CashThe Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations, and in 2014, the Company generated $3.3 billion of cash from operating activities which was $76 million higher than the prior year primarily driven by higher net earnings. In 2013, the Company generated $3.3 billion of cash from operating activities which increased $321 million from 2012 primarily driven by a $275 million contribution to the Company's qualified pension plans in 2012 that did not repeat. Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in September 2016. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information.CSX filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 15, 2013. This shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.Uses of CashCSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion, a decrease in spending of $44 million from the prior year primarily driven by higher net sales of short-term investments. In 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion, a decrease in spending of $50 million from 2012 primarily driven by higher net sales of short-term investments partially offset by lower proceeds from property dispositions. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

These partnership investments are for projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. 38CSX CORPORATIONPART IIPlanned capital investments for 2015 are expected to be $2.5 billion, including expected spending of approximately $300 million for PTC. This $2.5 billion excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year. Approximately half of the 2015 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. The remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives, freight cars and high return projects supporting long-term profitable growth, productivity initiatives and service improvements to optimize performance. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations. Over the long term, the Company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC. CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be at least $1.9 billion. This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. Total PTC spending through 2014 was $1.2 billion.In addition to capital investments, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases, share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders. In 2014, net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion, which represents a decrease in spending of $149 million. This decrease was driven by higher net long-term debt issued of $347 million (net of debt repayments) partially offset by share repurchases of $164 million. In 2013, net cash used in financing activities was $1.2 million, which was an increase in spending of $564 million driven by higher debt repayments and a lower amount of debt issued, partially offset by lower share repurchases.CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Liquidity and Working CapitalCurrently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $961 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX has a $1 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility expires in September 2016 and as of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. Additionally in 2014, CSX issued a total of $1 billion of new long-term debt. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock and dividends to shareholders. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements. The Company's $250 million receivables securitization facility has a three-year term and expires in June 2017. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity. The Company anticipates either renewing the facility or replacing it with another liquidity-based solution. Under the terms of this facility, CSXT transfers eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX services the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. In the event CSX Trade Receivables draws under this facility, the Company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. 39CSX CORPORATIONPART IIWorking capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $465 million and $178 million at December 2014 and 2013, respectively. This increase since the prior year is primarily due to a lower current maturities of long-term debt, partially offset by a net decrease in short-term investments driven by higher sales of these investments. Also, see sources and uses of cash description above.The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.Credit Ratings Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings improved during 2014. As of December 2013 and December 2014, S&P's long-term rating on CSX was BBB+ (Stable). Moody's improved the long-term credit rating on CSX from Baa2 at December 2013, to Baa1 (Stable) as of December 2014. Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt. 40CSX CORPORATIONPART IISCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTSThe following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other significant commitments: Type of Obligation20152016201720182019ThereafterTotal(Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations Total Debt (See Note 9)$228$21$631$619$518$7,725$9,742Interest on Debt5184874654243865,8758,155Purchase Obligations (See Note 7)9634961901811701,2723,272Other Post-Employment Benefits (See Note 8) (a)5249494644197437Operating Leases - Net (See Note 7) (b)494334261775244Agreements with Conrail (b)2626262626124254Total Contractual Obligations$1,836$1,122$1,395$1,322$1,161$15,268$22,104 Other Commitments (c)$13624326$153(a)Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans which are unfunded. No amounts are included for funded pension obligations as no contributions are currently required.(b)Agreements with Conrail represent minimum future lease payments of $254 million under the shared asset area agreements (see Note 12, Related Party Transactions). These amounts plus total operating leases-net of $244 million above equals total net lease commitments of $498 million disclosed in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.(c)Other commitments of $153 million consisted of surety bonds, letters of credit, uncertain tax positions and public private partnerships. Surety bonds of $57 million and letters of credit of $38 million arise from assurances issued by a third-party that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement. Uncertain tax positions of $21 million which include interest and penalties are all included in year 2015. The year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated, however, the Company believes at least $2 million of these unrecognized tax benefits will be resolved in the next 12 months. Contractual commitments related to public-private partnerships are $37 million.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSFor detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 41CSX CORPORATIONPART IICRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:•casualty, environmental and legal reserves;•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and•income taxes. Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves CasualtyCasualty reserves of $265 million in 2014 represent accruals for personal injury, occupational injury and asbestos claims. The Company's self-insured retention amount for these claims is $50 million per occurrence. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Company's self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC""), to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent third-party estimates, which are reviewed by management. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. Most of the Company's casualty claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, there were no significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust casualty reserves.Personal InjuryPersonal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”). In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. 42CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedOccupational & AsbestosOccupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as “irritants”) and diesel fuels (like exhaust fumes) or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss.The Company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. Other types of exposures, however, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business. Diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods (amount of time between exposure to asbestos and the onset of the disease) which can range from ten to 40 years after exposure.Occupational claims, excluding asbestos, are analyzed on a quarterly basis by an independent actuary in order to determine the number of unasserted, or incurred but not reported (“IBNR”), claims. The actuary’s analyses are reviewed by management. With the exception of carpal tunnel, management has determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which these unasserted occupational claim filings and claim values can be estimated. Carpal tunnel claims use a three-year period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries.Asbestos claims are analyzed by an independent specialist in order to determine the number of unasserted, or incurred but not reported (“IBNR”), claims. Since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated, management reviews asserted asbestos claims quarterly and the review by the specialist is completed annually. In 2014, management increased the forecast period from seven years to ten years. Based on a review of historical settlement trends, management concluded that ten years is the most probable time period in which unasserted asbestos claim filings and claim values can be estimated. The Company does not believe there is sufficient data to justify a projection period longer than ten years at this time. The change in the forecast period resulted in an immaterial increase in the asbestos reserves during 2014.The actuary and specialist analyze CSXT’s historical claim filings, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for occupational and asbestos claims reserves. The potentially exposed population is estimated by using CSXT’s employment records and industry data. From this analysis, the actuary and specialist provide estimates of the IBNR claims liabilities.The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims. 43CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedEnvironmental Environmental reserves were $94 million for 2014. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 250 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.In accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:•type of clean-up required;•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location. These recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries. Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements.Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the cost of remedial actions currently required. 44CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedLegalIn accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan AccountingThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. As of December 2014, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans were $3 billion and $340 million, respectively. No significant contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans are expected in 2015.In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Medicare-eligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Non-Medicare eligible retirees are covered by a self-insured program partially funded by participating retirees. The life insurance plan is non-contributory.For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans.The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;•long-term rate of return on plan assets;•salary scale inflation rates; and•other assumptions.The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. These amounts are reviewed by management. 45CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued Discount Rates Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2014 pension and post-retirement obligations are 4.00% and 3.60%, respectively. For 2013, the discount rate used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations was 4.75% and 4.25%, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2014, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years, respectively.Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its pension obligation was 7.25% and 7.50% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.Salary Scale Inflation Rates Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 3.75% to value its 2014 and 2013 pension obligations.Other AssumptionsThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are selected by management. 46CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued2015 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement ExpenseNet pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2015 is expected to be approximately $70 million and $20 million, respectively, compared to $58 million and $20 million, respectively, in 2014. The increase in pension expense is primarily related to lower discount rates and adoption of new mortality tables, partially offset by favorable pension asset experience.The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries and health care costs on the 2014 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:(Dollars in Millions)Pension OPEB Discount Rate 1% change$23 $2Long-term Rate of Return 1% change$23 N/ASalary Inflation 1% change$9 N/ADepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life MethodThe Company depreciates its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 85% of total fixed assets of $39 billion on a gross basis at December 2014. All other assets of the Company are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life.The Company currently utilizes more than 130 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method of accounting. Examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets. All assets of the Company are depreciated on a time or life basis.The Company believes the group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g., track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets.Under the group-life method of accounting, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management's assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study (also referred to as a life study) is the periodic review of asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the STB, the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets every three years and for road (e.g. bridges and signals) and track (e.g., rail, ties and ballast) assets every six years. In 2014, the Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets. In 2012, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets and a technical update (an update to the prior depreciation study) for its road and track assets. The Company believes the frequency currently required by the STB provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets. 47CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedChanges in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations.There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;•evaluation of current operations;•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;•previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use;•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. As individual assets within a specific group are retired, resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation. As part of the depreciation study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study. Since the overall assumption with group-life is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time.In the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales, resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately. These acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred. Examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage (e.g., major hurricanes), the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets (e.g., disposal of all refrigerated freight cars).Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for 2014 and 2013, respectively. A 1% change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $10 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. 48CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedIncome TaxesCSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2013. During 2014, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax year 2014. Management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2014, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $21 million.New Accounting Pronouncements and Change in Accounting PolicySee Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy.”FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the SEC, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements. The Company intends for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act may contain, among others, statements regarding: •projections and estimates of earnings, revenues, volumes, rates, cost-savings, expenses, taxes or other financial items;•expectations as to results of operations and operational initiatives;•expectations as to the effect of claims, lawsuits, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, labor negotiations or agreements on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity;•management's plans, strategies and objectives for future operations, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, safety and service performance, proposed new services and other matters that are not historical facts, and management's expectations as to future performance and operations and the time by which objectives will be achieved; and•future economic, industry or market conditions or performance and their effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 49CSX CORPORATIONPART IIForward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as ""will,"" ""should,"" “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate,” “preliminary” and similar expressions. The Company cautions against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect its good faith beliefs with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to it as of the date the forward-looking statement is made. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the timing when, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual performance or results could differ materially from those anticipated by any forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. If the Company does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be drawn that the Company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements. The following important factors, in addition to those discussed in Part II, Item 1A (Risk Factors) and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements: •legislative, regulatory or legal developments involving transportation, including rail or intermodal transportation, the environment, hazardous materials, taxation, and initiatives to further regulate the rail industry;•the outcome of litigation, claims and other contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge, environmental matters, taxes, shipper and rate claims subject to adjudication, personal injuries and occupational illnesses;•changes in domestic or international economic, political or business conditions, including those affecting the transportation industry (such as the impact of industry competition, conditions, performance and consolidation) and the level of demand for products carried by CSXT;•natural events such as severe weather conditions, including floods, fire, hurricanes and earthquakes, a pandemic crisis affecting the health of the Company's employees, its shippers or the consumers of goods, or other unforeseen disruptions of the Company's operations, systems, property or equipment;•competition from other modes of freight transportation, such as trucking and competition and consolidation within the transportation industry generally; •the cost of compliance with laws and regulations that differ from expectations (including those associated with Positive Train Control implementation) and costs, penalties and operational impacts associated with noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations;•the impact of increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas, including potential effects of high speed rail initiatives, or regulatory changes affecting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes;•unanticipated conditions in the financial markets that may affect timely access to capital markets and the cost of capital, as well as management's decisions regarding share repurchases; •changes in fuel prices, surcharges for fuel and the availability of fuel;•the impact of natural gas prices on coal-fired electricity generation; 50CSX CORPORATIONPART II•availability of insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or insufficient insurance coverage to cover claims or damages;•the inherent business risks associated with safety and security, including the availability and vulnerability of information technology, adverse economic or operational effects from actual or threatened war or terrorist activities and any governmental response;•labor and benefit costs and labor difficulties, including stoppages affecting either the Company's operations or customers' ability to deliver goods to the Company for shipment;•the Company's success in implementing its strategic, financial and operational initiatives; •changes in operating conditions and costs or commodity concentrations; and•the inherent uncertainty associated with projecting economic and business conditions.Other important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified elsewhere in this report and in CSX's other SEC reports, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Company's website at www.csx.com. The information on the CSX website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 2014, CSX does not have a material amount of floating rate debt obligations outstanding, and therefore fluctuations in the interest rate would not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 51CSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 8.

277948,CSX,CSX CORP,2016,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Item 1A. Risk Factors The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices. Legislation passed by Congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business. For instance, several of the proposals under consideration by the STB could have a significant negative impact on the Company's ability to negotiate prices for the value of rail services provided and meet service standards, which could force a reduction in capital spending. In addition, statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies and impact service performance. For example, the RSIA mandates that the installation of PTC hardware be completed by December 31, 2018 and, assuming certain conditions are met, requires that the PTC system be fully operational by December 31, 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. Noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. 6CSX CORPORATIONPART IClimate change and other emissions-related legislation and regulation could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. Climate change and other emissions-related legislation and regulation have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and is expected to issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Capacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency. CSXT may experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased volume; (ii) locomotive or crew shortages; (iii) extreme weather conditions; (iv) increased passenger activities, including high-speed rail; or (v) regulatory changes impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes, which could have a negative effect on CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.Global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight. A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, if the rate of economic growth in Asia slows or if European economies contract, U.S. export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for CSX. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives, railcars and other equipment, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Over the past few years, production of natural gas in the U.S. has also increased dramatically, which has resulted in lower natural gas prices. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Additionally, depressed crude oil prices due to increased supply or lower demand could result in a decrease in domestic crude oil production, which could have an adverse effect on crude oil volumes for CSX. In addition, new regulations related to the shipment of crude oil by rail, including proposed rail car safety standards, could increase costs for CSX, negatively impact network fluidity or have an adverse impact on customers. 7CSX CORPORATIONPART ICSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate. CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials. The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company. The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. Such an event could result in increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 8CSX CORPORATIONPART IDisruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs. The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports, adverse political developments or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted. Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Most of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention of the U.S. President), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, or if terms of existing agreements are disputed, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. The Company faces competition from other transportation providers. The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations. Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies. 9CSX CORPORATIONPART ISevere weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage. The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.The Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the Company's insurance coverage. Additionally, the Company is subject to adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates. The unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period.Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, the Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments as well as on bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone 10CSX CORPORATIONPART IItem 2. Properties The Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern cities of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.CSXT’s track structure includes main thoroughfares, connecting terminals and yards (known as mainline track), track within terminals and switching yards, track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains, track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles are greater than CSXT’s approximately 21,000 route miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads. At December 2015, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track MilesMainline track26,565Terminals and switching yards9,390Passing sidings and turnouts936Total36,891In addition to its physical track structure, CSXT operates numerous yards and terminals. These serve as hubs between CSXT and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars often are received, re-sorted and placed onto new outbound trains. The Company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume (number of railcars or intermodal containers processed) are listed in the table below.Yards and TerminalsAnnualVolume(number of units processed)Chicago, IL1,072,809Waycross, GA672,801Selkirk, NY544,452Indianapolis, IN527,170Willard, OH517,891Nashville, TN497,371Cincinnati, OH485,105Hamlet, NC461,780Louisville, KY396,681Toledo, OH372,666 11CSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork Geography CSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent, high-speed intermodal, automotive and merchandise service. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries consumer goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, coal and intermodal.Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia, and provides access to major eastern ports.Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Southeast, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. CSXT’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Roughly one-third of the tons of export coal and the majority of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity.See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network. 12CSX CORPORATIONPART ICSX Rail Network 13CSX CORPORATIONPART ILocomotives CSXT owns and long-term leases nearly 4,500 locomotives, almost all of which are owned by CSXT. From time to time, the Company also short-term leases locomotives based on business needs. Freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull trains. Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar is attached to the right train in order to deliver it to its final destination. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. At December 2015, CSXT’s fleet of owned and long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following types of locomotives: Locomotives % Average Age(years)Freight3,932 88% 20Switching322 7% 35Auxiliary Units209 5% 23Total4,463 100% 20 Equipment In 2015, the average daily fleet of cars on line consisted of approximately 206,000 cars. At any time, over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by the Company. Examples of these non-CSXT railcars are as follows: railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service) and multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared among railroads). The Company’s revenue generating equipment (either owned or long-term leased) consists of freight cars and containers as described below. Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions.Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine. Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers.Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles.Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.Containers – Weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight. Other cars on the network consist primarily of refrigerated boxcars for transporting perishable items. 14CSX CORPORATIONPART I At December 2015, the Company’s owned and long-term leased equipment consisted of the following:EquipmentNumber of Units %Gondolas24,844 37%Open-top hoppers11,161 17%Multi-level flat cars11,634 18%Covered hoppers10,308 16%Box cars7,386 11%Flat cars674 1%Other cars379 —%Subtotal freight cars66,386 100%Containers18,231 Total equipment84,617 Item 3.

CSX purchases its own shares for two primary reasons: (1) to further its goals under its share repurchase program and (2) to fund the Company’s contribution required to be paid in CSX common stock under a 401(k) plan that covers certain union employees.In April 2015, the Company announced a new $2 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by April 2017. Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guide the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances. During 2015, 2014, and 2013, CSX repurchased $804 million, or 26 million shares, $517 million, or 17 million shares, and $353 million, or 14 million shares, respectively, of common stock. In accordance with the Equity Topic in the Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC""), the excess of repurchase price over par value is recorded in retained earnings. Generally, retained earnings is only impacted by net earnings and dividends. Share repurchase activity of $258 million for the fourth quarter 2015 was as follows:CSX Purchases of Equity Securities for the QuarterFourth Quarter (a)Total Number of Shares Purchased (b)Average Price Paid per ShareTotal Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs(b) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or ProgramsBeginning Balance $1,584,194,942October3,062,615$27.383,037,000 1,501,038,454November3,029,87527.453,029,800 1,417,877,753December3,401,20026.893,401,200 1,326,402,817Ending Balance9,493,690$27.239,468,000 $1,326,402,817(a) Fourth quarter 2015 consisted of the following fiscal periods: October (September 26, 2015 - October 23, 2013), November (October 24, 2015 - November 20, 2015), and December (November 21, 2015 - December 25, 2015).(b) The difference of 25,690 shares between the ""Total Number of Shares Repurchase"" and the ""Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs"" for the quarter represents shares purchased to fund the Company's contribution to a 401(k) plan that covers certain union employees. 18CSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 6.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSTRATEGIC OVERVIEW CSX provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations with its approximately 29,000 dedicated employees. The Company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the long-term economic success and improved global competitiveness of the United States. Low natural gas prices, increased foreign labor costs and supply chain factors have helped to improve competitiveness of CSX's customers over the long term. The rail industry benefits from this long-term improved global competitiveness, continued economic growth and the shift towards more rail-based solutions. U.S. demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise and freight railroads provide the most environmentally efficient and economical means to meet this growing demand. CSX can move a ton of freight about 475 miles on one gallon of diesel fuel, as trains are four times more fuel efficient than trucks on average. Shipping freight by rail also alleviates highway congestion, eases air pollution and saves energy.CSX's network reaches nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population, which accounts for the majority of the nation's consumption of goods. Through this network, the Company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the country's needs. These products range from agricultural goods, such as grains, to chemicals, automobiles, metals, building materials, paper, consumer products, and energy sources like coal, ethanol and crude oil. The Company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business: merchandise, intermodal and coal. CSX's transportation solutions connect industries and population centers across the United States with each other and with global markets through access to over 70 port facilities whereby meeting the transportation needs of energy producers, manufacturers, industrial producers, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers and the United States Armed Forces.Operating InitiativesTo support long-term growth, CSX is focused on meeting or exceeding customers’ expectations while improving profitability. Several key operating initiatives have been implemented over the past several years that lay a foundation for meeting these objectives. The overall goal is sustained high customer service levels, which is in part achieved through a relentless focus on using advanced network modeling analytics and tools to create a disciplined, scheduled approach to designing and running CSX's network. The Company continues to identify the most efficient, cost-effective routes for CSXT customers' traffic while providing timely service with the fewest handlings and car miles possible.Through the Service Excellence initiative, CSX is building a culture that engages all employees and focuses on the value delivered to customers through improved service. This initiative increases employee communication and dialogue to help identify and resolve customer issues at the lowest level, improving the customer experience and allowing CSX to grow the business. This process involves engagement from all operating employees, as well as collaboration with sales and marketing employees and, ultimately, with the Company’s customers. Higher levels of customer service and satisfaction support CSX’s ability to profitably grow the business by increasing customer retention, price sustainability and asset utilization. 20CSX CORPORATIONPART IIIn addition, Total Service Integration (“TSI”) is intended to align operating capabilities with customers' needs resulting in an efficient and effective service product. TSI was first implemented in the unit train network, where it successfully increased the average number of cars per train and improved asset utilization. CSX has been implementing TSI in the carload network over the past few years and has focused on improving the “first and last mile” service experience for carload customers, providing a more consistent and reliable service product. The carload network is connected to more than 5,000 customer facilities and has a high degree of variability each day. New tools and technology have allowed the Company to more effectively communicate with customers, not only providing the service the Company has promised to deliver but proactively notifying the customer of service status. Applying TSI to the carload network has improved local customer service satisfaction and local service performance. Finally, Enterprise Asset Management (“EAM”) focuses on improving the utilization of the company’s most critical assets, namely, crews, locomotives, cars and track infrastructure. Projects are currently in place to deploy technology, improve processes and reduce unproductive time. Because the railroad is an asset intensive industry, EAM helps reduce the overall expense associated with asset ownership by monitoring the overall condition of equipment, helping proactively schedule maintenance, increasing utilization and also effectively managing the investment required for new or replacement assets. By improving asset utilization, CSX expects to sustain long-term operating efficiencies and reduce future capital expenditures associated with asset replacement.In summary, these initiatives are designed to improve service levels in a cost effective manner and enhance the reliability of rail transportation. These improvements to operational processes, customer communication and service are better aligning CSX's operating capabilities with customers' needs and are enabling the Company to capitalize on the strategic opportunities described below.Strategic OpportunitiesIntermodal Growth CSX’s intermodal business is a growth opportunity that provides an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck. CSX’s intermodal network connects all major population centers east of the Mississippi River, and over 90% of intermodal traffic moves in double-stack (two containers high) service. This positions the Company to capture a significant share of the incremental domestic intermodal market opportunity, estimated at nine million truckloads in the eastern United States that move over 550 miles. The Company’s highway-to-rail initiatives assist in capturing this traffic and also help customers identify conversion opportunities for both domestic moves and the U.S. portion of international moves.To further enhance the Company's intermodal offering and support future growth, CSX recently completed new or expanded terminal construction to increase network capacity and broaden its market presence in key growth areas. In 2015, CSX began construction on a new terminal near Pittsburgh, PA, enhancing the Company’s reach and supporting continued growth. Over the past several years, the Company also opened or expanded seven other terminals in Winter Haven, FL; Quebec, Canada; Columbus, OH; Louisville, KY; Atlanta, GA; and Worcester, MA; as well as the Company's Northwest Ohio terminal which is part of the National Gateway Initiative discussed below.Illinois Basin Coal ShiftEnergy markets have shifted over the past few years and continue to evolve. For instance, domestic utility coal demand decreased in 2015 relative to previous years. In the long term, downward pressure on domestic coal volumes will likely continue as the result of increasingly stringent existing and proposed environmental regulations and continued low natural gas prices. In addition, mining economics are causing a shift from Central Appalachian coal to thermal coal in the Illinois Basin and the Powder River Basin. CSX will capitalize on these shifts and address structural costs in the regions of declining volume. 21CSX CORPORATIONPART IIExport CoalCSX export coal volume and pricing is subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy, competition from foreign coal producers and regulatory shifts. Over the past few years, CSX has capitalized on the global coal demand in both steel manufacturing and power generation. Currently, both global thermal and metallurgical coal prices are low due to oversupply, but CSX sees long-term growth in global demand as developing countries become more urbanized. The Company remains opportunistic based on the global markets and the resulting level of demand. Energy Markets Shale drilling for the extraction of oil and natural gas has created the opportunity for CSX to serve energy markets such as crude oil, liquefied petroleum gases (“LPG”), frac sand and other related materials, although energy market volume is volatile from year to year. For example, CSX is capitalizing on the opportunity to move the supply of crude oil from the domestic oil fields, particularly those located in the Bakken Shale region of North Dakota, to customers at eastern refineries. This service also provides greater flexibility in source locations as compared to pipelines. Volume, however, may vary depending upon oil prices and spreads. CSX’s LPG market is also benefiting from drilling in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia within the Utica shale region. Midstream energy companies, which are involved in the transportation, storage and wholesale of refined petroleum products, are taking advantage of the abundance of inexpensive wet gas with newly constructed gas processing plants (or “fractionators”) in the region. Rail will also play a vital role in moving LPG products from the fractionators to the market.Over the longer term, the energy supply outlook for the U.S. will create a sustainable competitive advantage for domestic chemical producers and generate additional growth opportunities for rail. Since natural gas is the primary component in the production of a wide range of petrochemicals, the supply growth and the resulting lower prices have now placed the U.S. amongst the lowest cost production regions in the world. This increased competitiveness is sparking significant investment in new U.S. chemical industry capacity for the first time in more than a decade. CSX is well-positioned to participate in this growing chemical business over the next several years.Public-Private PartnershipsExpanding capacity on U.S. rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation, increased business activity at U.S. ports, reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions. Therefore, CSX and its government partners are jointly working to invest in multi-year rail infrastructure projects such as the National Gateway. This initiative is a public-private partnership which will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest for double-stack intermodal trains. As part of the National Gateway project, CSX broke ground on the modernization of the Virginia Avenue Tunnel in Washington, D.C. in 2015.This project will improve the flow of freight traffic through the District of Columbia and will eliminate a rail-traffic bottleneck that also impacts commuter and passenger trains in the region. The new structure will provide double-stack train clearances in Maryland, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Going forward, CSX will continue to explore other opportunities to partner with the public sector to maximize the many public benefits of freight rail. 22CSX CORPORATIONPART IIBalanced Approach to Cash Deployment CSX remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business, dividend growth and share repurchases. In 2015, the Company invested $2.6 billion to further enhance the capacity, quality, safety and flexibility of its network. In addition, CSX continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During 2015, the Company announced a 13 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.18 per common share. The Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 13 times over the last ten years which represents a 26 percent compounded annual growth rate. Also in 2015, CSX announced a new $2 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by April 2017 based on market and business decisions. CSX repurchased $804 million, or 26 million shares, during 2015 under this program. Since 2006, CSX has repurchased 520 million shares (adjusted for stock splits) for $9.6 billion, which represents about one-half of total shares currently outstanding. As part of this balanced approach, the Company is committed to maintaining a credit profile consistent with a BBB+ rating by Standard & Poor’s and a Baa1 rating by Moody’s Investment Services.SummaryThese operating initiatives, strategic areas, long-term investments and shareholder returns discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth, productivity improvement, enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations. To continue these types of investments, the Company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value. CSX will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the Company's rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies. 23CSX CORPORATIONPART II2015 HIGHLIGHTS• Revenue of $11.8 billion decreased $858 million or 7% versus the prior year.• Expenses of $8.2 billion decreased $829 million or 9% year over year.• Operating income of $3.6 billion decreased $29 million or 1% year over year.• Operating ratio of 69.7%, the Company’s first sub-70 percent full-year operating ratio, improved 180 basis points from 71.5%.•Earnings per diluted share of $2.00 increased $0.08 or 4% year over year.

Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. As described below, free cash flow before dividends increased $73 million year over year to $992 million. The primary reason for the increase in free cash flow from the prior year is primarily due to the following:•Higher proceeds from a property sale and other related income of $85 million•Higher net sales of long-term marketable securities of $71 million•Partially offsetting these increases were higher property additions of $113 million The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure).

These partnership investments of $14 million, $8 million and $40 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. 25CSX CORPORATIONPART IIRESULTS OF OPERATIONS2015 vs. 2014 Results of Operations Fiscal Years 2015 2014 $ Change % Change (Dollars in Millions) Revenue$11,811 $12,669 $(858) (7)% Expense Labor and Fringe3,290 3,377 87 3 Materials, Supplies and Other2,336 2,484 148 6 Fuel957 1,616 659 41 Depreciation1,208 1,151 (57) (5) Equipment and Other Rents436 428 (8) (2) Total Expense8,227 9,056 829 9 Operating Income3,584 3,613 (29) (1) Interest Expense(544) (545) 1 — Other Income - Net98 (24) 122 (508) Income Tax Expense(1,170) (1,117) (53) (5) Net Earnings$1,968 $1,927 $41 2 Earnings Per Diluted Share: Net Earnings$2.00 $1.92 $0.08 4 % Operating Ratio69.7% 71.5% (180)bpsVolume and Revenue (Unaudited)Volume (Thousands of units); Revenue (Dollars in Millions); Revenue Per Unit (Dollars) Volume Revenue Revenue Per Unit 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % ChangeAgricultural Agricultural Products411 419 (2)% $1,087 $1,130 (4)% $2,645 $2,697 (2)%Phosphates and Fertilizers301 330 (9) 489 534 (8) 1,625 1,618 —Food and Consumer92 94 (2) 258 265 (3) 2,804 2,819 (1)Industrial Chemicals621 620 — 2,093 2,178 (4) 3,370 3,513 (4)Automotive450 435 3 1,175 1,213 (3) 2,611 2,789 (6)Metals233 276 (16) 596 701 (15) 2,558 2,540 1Housing and Construction Forest Products290 307 (6) 796 819 (3) 2,745 2,668 3Minerals311 293 6 469 459 2 1,508 1,567 (4)Waste and Equipment151 158 (4) 308 309 — 2,040 1,956 4Total Merchandise2,860 2,932 (2) 7,271 7,608 (4) 2,542 2,595 (2)Coal1,063 1,262 (16) 2,300 2,849 (19) 2,164 2,258 (4)Intermodal2,838 2,728 4 1,762 1,790 (2) 621 656 (5)Other— — — 478 422 13 — — —Total6,761 6,922 (2)% $11,811 $12,669 (7)% $1,747 $1,830 (5)% 26CSX CORPORATIONPART IIRevenueIn 2015, Revenue decreased $858 million, or 7%, mostly due to the decline in fuel surcharge of $646 million. Additionally, the decline in volume of 2% and unfavorable mix were partially offset by pricing strength.MerchandiseAgriculturalAgricultural Products - Volume declined due to challenging world market conditions and a strong U.S. dollar. Specifically, high levels of imported ethanol reduced rail moves to Eastern markets and export grain was down significantly. These declines were partially offset by strength in feed grain and domestic soybean moves, reflecting the record 2014-2015 harvest. Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume was down, reflecting weak demand for fertilizers driven by oversupply, low corn prices and a challenged export market due to strength of the U.S. dollar.Food and Consumer - Volume declined as excess truck capacity and poor Western crop yields in produce led to lower shipments of fresh foods.IndustrialChemicals - Volume was flat as strong gains in LPG and petroleum products were offset by a slowdown in crude oil and frac sand due to low oil prices. Automotive - Volume increased as gains in auto movement, especially SUVs and trucks, resulted from strong North American light vehicle production and consumer demand.Metals - Volume declined due to high levels of steel imports which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar and led to lower production of domestic steel.Housing and ConstructionForest Products - Volume declines reflect high inventories of building products in the housing sector as well as declining demand due to electronic substitution in paper products.Minerals - Volume growth reflects strength in aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) due to increased highway and non-residential construction activity.Waste and Equipment - Volume was down as a result of the conclusion of major remediation projects and reduced military vehicle movement partially offset by increases in municipal waste.CoalDomestic - Volume declined as a result of mild weather, high stockpiles and low natural gas prices favoring natural gas power generation.Export - Reductions in both metallurgical and thermal coal volume resulted from ongoing weak market conditions due to global oversupply and the strength of the U.S. dollar.IntermodalDomestic - Domestic volume increased 12% due to customer growth, continued success with CSX’s highway-to-rail conversion program and new service offerings. International - Competitive losses resulted in a 5% international volume decline during a volatile year marked by West Coast port disruption, a subsequent volume surge and then a weak peak season. 27CSX CORPORATIONPART IIOther Other revenue increased $56 million as a result of higher revenue from customers who did not meet minimum contractual volumes as well as higher incidental revenue.ExpenseIn 2015, total expenses decreased $829 million, or 9%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $87 million primarily due to the following items:•Inflation resulted in $128 million of additional cost driven by increased wages partially offset by reduced health and welfare costs.•Incentive compensation was $97 million lower reflecting reduced award payouts on existing plans.•Efficiency savings of $84 million were primarily a result of reduced crew starts due to the Company's train length initiatives, lower operating support costs and reduced management headcount.•Volume-related costs were $66 million lower.•Restructuring costs were $2 million higher versus prior year. See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “Workforce Reduction Plans, Separation and Other Costs.”•Various other costs increased $30 million.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal services at automotive facilities and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expenses decreased $148 million primarily driven by the following:•Efficiency savings of $91 million were driven by a reduction in professional costs as well as lower operating support costs.•Volume-related costs were $52 million lower.•Real estate gains were $23 million higher primarily related to the sale of operating rail corridor.•Inflation resulted in $47 million of additional costs.•Various other costs decreased $29 million.Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $659 million driven by the following:•Average fuel price per gallon decreased 39%, from $1.15 to $1.80 per gallon, versus the prior year which reduced expenses by $560 million.•Volume-related costs were $66 million lower.•Other fuel savings of $33 million were primarily due to lower non-locomotive fuel price. Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $57 million primarily due to a larger asset base. 28CSX CORPORATIONPART IIEquipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $8 million driven by the following:•Inflation resulted in $16 million of additional cost related to rates on automotive and intermodal cars.•Efficiency savings of $15 million were due to improved car cycle times.•Net other costs increased $7 million.Interest expense decreased $1 million to $544 million primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average debt balances.Other income (expense) - net increased $122 million to $98 million primarily due to a $59 million gain on a sale of non-operating easements and a reimbursement of environmental costs of $21 million related to this sale. Additionally, 2015 environmental costs were $21 million lower than 2014, and prior year costs of $16 million associated with the early redemption of long-term debt did not repeat in the current year.Income tax expense increased $53 million to $1.2 billion primarily due to higher earnings as well as prior year favorable state legislative changes that did not repeat in the current year.Net earnings increased $41 million to $2.0 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.08 to $2.00 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding resulting from higher share repurchase activity also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share. 29CSX CORPORATIONPART II2014 vs. 2013 Results of Operations Fiscal Years 2014 2013 $ Change % Change (Dollars in Millions) Revenue$12,669 $12,026 $643 5 % Expense Labor and Fringe3,377 3,138 (239) (8) Materials, Supplies and Other2,484 2,275 (209) (9) Fuel1,616 1,656 40 2 Depreciation1,151 1,104 (47) (4) Equipment and Other Rents428 380 (48) (13) Total Expense9,056 8,553 (503) (6) Operating Income3,613 3,473 140 4 Interest Expense(545) (562) 17 3 Other Income - Net(24) 11 (35) (318) Income Tax Expense(1,117) (1,058) (59) (6) Net Earnings$1,927 $1,864 $63 3 Earnings Per Diluted Share: Net Earnings$1.92 $1.83 $0.09 5 % Operating Ratio71.5% 71.1% 40bpsVolume and Revenue (Unaudited)Volume (Thousands of units); Revenue (Dollars in Millions); Revenue Per Unit (Dollars) Volume Revenue Revenue Per Unit 2014 2013 % Change 2014 2013 % Change 2014 2013 % ChangeAgricultural Agricultural Products419 390 7 % $1,130 $1,013 12 % $2,697 $2,597 4 %Phosphates and Fertilizers330 327 1 534 527 1 1,618 1,612 —Food and Consumer94 96 (2) 265 269 (1) 2,819 2,802 1Industrial Chemicals620 532 17 2,178 1,896 15 3,513 3,564 (1)Automotive435 432 1 1,213 1,217 — 2,789 2,817 (1)Metals276 262 5 701 644 9 2,540 2,458 3Housing and Construction Forest Products307 298 3 819 775 6 2,668 2,601 3Minerals293 275 7 459 432 6 1,567 1,571 —Waste and Equipment158 150 5 309 264 17 1,956 1,760 11Total Merchandise2,932 2,762 6 7,608 7,037 8 2,595 2,548 2Coal1,262 1,195 6 2,849 2,895 (2) 2,258 2,423 (7)Intermodal2,728 2,582 6 1,790 1,697 5 656 657 —Other— — — 422 397 6 — — —Total6,922 6,539 6 % $12,669 $12,026 5 % $1,830 $1,839 — % 30CSX CORPORATIONPART IIRevenueIn 2014, volume increased 6% year over year with growth across most markets. Revenue increased by 5% year over year driven by this broad-based volume growth.MerchandiseAgriculturalAgricultural Products - Volume growth was driven by increased shipments of grain and ethanol. A combined record corn and soybean crop in 2013 led to higher grain shipments and reduced U.S. corn prices resulting in increased ethanol production in 2014.Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume growth was driven by increased shipments of finished fertilizer products to replenish inventories and phosphate rock shipments due to capacity at a customer facility returning to normal levels.Food and Consumer - Volume declined due to lower shipments of canned goods and rice. The decline in canned goods was driven by market losses, while rice shipments were lower as customers substituted lower-priced corn. This decline was partially offset by growth in alcoholic beverage shipments due to a customer’s gain in market share.IndustrialChemicals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in energy-related shipments that included crude oil, LPG and frac sand. The rise in crude oil shipments to East Coast refineries was due to increased supply of low-cost crude oil from shale drilling activity. Automotive - Volume increased as North American light vehicle production grew, but rail equipment shortages due to network performance in early 2014 tempered this growth.Metals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in sheet steel shipments due to growth in automotive production and market gains.Housing and ConstructionForest Products -Volume increased due to increased shipments of building products and pulpboard. Building products was driven by the continued recovery in the residential housing market. Pulpboard shipments increased due to modal conversions and inventory replenishments that resulted from reduced production late last year.Minerals - Volume growth was driven by increased shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) and salt. Aggregates was driven by the continued recovery in construction activity, while salt shipments grew due to increased application of road salt and inventory replenishment as a result of the severe winter weather in early 2014.Waste and Equipment - Volume increased due to growth in machinery shipments of wind energy components and municipal solid waste shipments from a new service offering to a customer location. This growth was partially offset by lower industrial waste shipments due to the completion of one-time remediation projects.CoalDomestic volume increased due to higher shipments attributable to higher natural gas prices, marketplace gains and utilities replenishing stockpiles. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in export coal as a result of softening global market conditions. 31CSX CORPORATIONPART IIIntermodalDomestic volume increased as a result of growth with existing customers and continued success with highway-to-rail conversions. International volume also increased due to growth with customers in global container shipments moving to inland destinations.Other Other revenue increased primarily due to higher incidental revenue associated with higher volume partially offset by decline in revenue from customers who did not meet minimum contractual volumes.ExpenseIn 2014, total expenses increased $503 million, or 6%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $239 million primarily due to the following items:•Volume-related costs were $71 million higher primarily due to increased workforce levels to capture strong customer demand. •Inflation was $67 million higher.•Labor costs were $49 million higher due to overtime and relief crews associated with weather disruptions earlier in the year and efforts to improve network performance.•An initial charge for $39 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of an initiative to reduce the management workforce. See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “Workforce Reduction Plans, Separation and Other Costs.”•Labor costs were $30 million higher due to an amended locomotive maintenance service agreement where CSX now provides oversight of the labor force. Outside service costs shifted from materials, supplies and other to labor and fringe. Overall expense is neutral for the year. •Other costs were $17 million lower primarily due to reduced pension costs and incentive compensation costs that reflect lower award payments.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal services at automotive facilities and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expenses increased$209 million primarily driven by the following:•Prior year real estate gains were $85 million. No gains were recognized in the current year.•Volume-related costs rose $58 million primarily due to increased resource levels in response to the 6% volume growth to help capture strong customer demand.•Utilities, materials and foreign locomotive costs were $44 million higher in response to weather-related service challenges earlier in the year and efforts to improve network performance.•Inflation was $39 million higher.•Risk-related costs increased by $13 million due to higher derailments earlier in the year, which reflect the increase in the FRA train accident frequency rate.•Partially offsetting these increases was the amended locomotive maintenance agreement which shifted $30 million to labor and fringe as referenced above. 32CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $40 million driven by the following:•Average fuel price per gallon decreased $0.22 to $2.95 per gallon versus the prior year which reduced expenses by $112 million. •Improved efficiency reduced expenses by $19 million.•Volume-related costs were $99 million higher.•Other fuel savings were $8 million.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $47 million primarily due to a larger asset base.Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $48 million driven by the following:•Car hire costs were $31 million higher due to volume, longer car cycle times and network performance.•Inflation resulted in $18 million of additional costs related to rates on automotive, intermodal and coal cars.•Other costs improved $1 million.Interest expense decreased $17 million to $545 million primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average debt balances.Other (expense) income - net decreased $35 million to an expense of $24 million primarily due to an increase in estimated environmental costs of $17 million related to non-operating activities as well as costs of $16 million associated with the early redemption of long-term debt.Income tax expense increased $59 million to $1.1 billion primarily due to higher earnings partially offset by favorable state legislative changes.Net earnings increased $63 million to $1.9 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.09 to $1.92 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share. 33CSX CORPORATIONPART IIOperating Statistics (Estimated) Fiscal Years 2015 2014 Improvement/ (Deterioration)Safety and Service Measurements FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index0.89 0.98 9 %FRA Train Accident Rate2.45 2.41 (2)On-Time Train Originations67% 56% 20On-Time Destination Arrivals51% 45% 13Dwell25.8 26.3 2Train Velocity20.5 20.1 2Cars-On-Line206,078 203,699 (1)Key Performance Measures DefinitionsFRA Personal Injury Frequency Index - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours.FRA Train Accident Rate - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.On-Time Train Originations - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.On-Time Destination Arrivals - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to two hours late (30 minutes for intermodal trains).Dwell - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival at and departure from the yard.

The Company measures and reports safety and service performance. The Company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training, innovation and investment. For example, the Company's safety and train accident prevention programs rely on the latest tools, programs and employee participation that strengthen the safety culture in a supportive environment that allows each employee to be successful at CSX. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance. CSX safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can impact employees, customers and the communities we serve. The Company constantly collaborates with the FRA and industry organizations as well as federal, state and local governments on safety innovations and initiatives. For example, CSX and other freight railroads have actively worked with the U.S. Department of Transportation (""DOT"") and other key stakeholders to evaluate and implement far-reaching safety enhancements for transportation of certain flammable materials, including essential energy products, on the nation’s freight railroad network. At CSX, operational success is built on employee commitment to maintaining a constant focus on safety. CSX remains the industry leader with the lowest personal injury across Class I railroads this year. The FRA reportable personal injury frequency index improved 9 percent year over year to 0.89. The reported FRA train accident frequency rate weakened 2 percent year over year to 2.45.The Company made strong improvements to network reliability and service measures in 2015 while continuing to drive productivity and resource efficiency. On-time originations improved 20 percent year over year to 67 percent, and on-time arrivals increased 13 percent year over year to 51 percent. Average train velocity and terminal dwell both improved 2 percent year over year to 20.5 miles per hour and 25.8 hours, respectively. 34CSX CORPORATIONPART IILIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed.Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash FlowsConsolidated Balance SheetsCSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend improvement and share repurchases.Total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $2.0 billion from prior year. The increase in assets was driven by higher net properties of $1.6 billion resulting from capital investments as well as higher short-term investments of $518 million. The increase in total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined was driven by net earnings of $1.9 billion and new debt of $1.5 billion (which includes about $300 million of deferred seller financing). Partially offsetting these increases were dividends paid of $686 million and share repurchases of $804 million.Significant cash flowsThe following tables present net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2013, 2014 and 2015. 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013(Dollars in millions)201520142013 $ Var $ VarNet cash provided by operating activities$3,370$3,343$3,267 $27 $76Net cash used in investing activities$(2,892)$(2,183)$(2,227) $(709) $44Net cash used in financing activities$(519)$(1,083)$(1,232) $564 $149Sources of CashThe Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2015, the Company generated $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities which was $27 million higher than prior year primarily driven by higher collections of freight accounts receivable. In 2014, the Company generated $3.3 billion of cash from operating activities which was $76 million higher than 2013 primarily driven by higher net earnings. Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2020. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information.Third, CSX filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in February 2013 which the Company expects to renew in February 2016. This shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. 35CSX CORPORATIONPART IIUses of CashCSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion, an increase in net investing of $709 million from the prior year primarily driven by fewer net sales of short-term investments. In 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion, a decrease in spending of $44 million from 2013 primarily driven by higher net sales of short-term investments. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

These partnership investments are for projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. Planned capital investments for 2016 are expected to be $2.4 billion, including approximately $300 million for PTC. This $2.4 billion excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in the year the reimbursement obligation arises. Approximately half of the 2016 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. The remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives, freight cars and high return projects supporting long-term profitable growth, productivity initiatives and service improvements. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations. Over the long term, the Company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC. CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be approximately $2.2 billion. This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. Total PTC spending through 2015 was $1.5 billion. In addition to capital investments, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases, share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders. In 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $519 million, which represents a decrease in spending of $564 million from the prior year primarily driven by higher net long-term debt issued of $904 million (net of lower debt repayments) partially offset by higher share repurchases of $287 million. In 2014, net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion, which represents a decrease in spending of $149 million from 2013. This decrease was driven by higher net long-term debt issued of $347 million (net of debt repayments) partially offset by share repurchases of $164 million. 36CSX CORPORATIONPART IICSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Liquidity and Working CapitalCurrently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX has a $1 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility expires in May 2020 and as of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. Additionally in 2015, CSX issued a total of $1.2 billion of new long-term debt. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time, repurchases of CSX's common stock, capital investments, working capital requirements and improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements. The Company has a receivables securitization facility with a three-year term expiring in June 2017. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity of up to $250 million. Under the terms of this facility, CSXT transfers eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX services the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. In the event CSX Trade Receivables draws under this facility, the Company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility.Working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $1 billion and $465 million at December 2015 and 2014, respectively. This increase since the prior year end is primarily due to the net proceeds from a debt issuance partially offset by debt repayments. Also, see sources and uses of cash description above.The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.Credit Ratings Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. 37CSX CORPORATIONPART IIThe cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings remained stable during 2015. As of December 2014 and December 2015, S&P's long-term rating on CSX was BBB+ (Stable), and Moody's was Baa1 (Stable). Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.SCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTSThe following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other significant commitments: Type of Obligation20162017201820192020ThereafterTotal(Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations Total Debt (See Note 9)$20$632$619$518$745$8,169$10,703Interest on Debt5705345004624316,4918,988Purchase Obligations (See Note 7)6806353073233284,5796,852Other Post-Employment Benefits (See Note 8) (a)5149474543188423Operating Leases - Net (See Note 7) (b)47402725761207Agreements with Conrail (b)262626262698228Total Contractual Obligations$1,394$1,916$1,526$1,399$1,580$19,586$27,401 Other Commitments (c)$106$4$3$2$2$4$121(a)Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans which are unfunded. No amounts are included for funded pension obligations as no contributions are currently required.(b)Agreements with Conrail represent minimum future lease payments of $228 million under the shared asset area agreements (see Note 12, Related Party Transactions). These amounts plus total operating leases-net of $207 million above equals total net lease commitments of $435 million disclosed in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.(c)Other commitments of $121 million consisted of surety bonds, letters of credit, uncertain tax positions and public private partnerships. Surety bonds of $44 million and letters of credit of $37 million arise from assurances issued by a third-party that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement. Uncertain tax positions of $23 million which include interest and penalties are all included in year 2016. The year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated. Contractual commitments related to public-private partnerships are $17 million.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSFor detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 38CSX CORPORATIONPART IICRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:•casualty, environmental and legal reserves;•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and•income taxes. Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves CasualtyCasualty reserves of $265 million and $269 million for 2014 and 2015, respectively, represent accruals for personal injury, asbestos and occupational injury claims. The Company's self-insured retention amount for these claims is $50 million per occurrence. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in estimate. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. Most of the Company's casualty claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust casualty reserves.Personal InjuryPersonal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to FELA. In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other current or former CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience.Asbestos & OccupationalThe Company is party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The greatest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. Other types of exposures, however, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business. Diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods (amount of time between exposure to asbestos and the onset of the disease) which can range from 10 to 40 years after exposure. 39CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedManagement reviews asserted asbestos claims quarterly. Since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated, unasserted or incurred but not reported (""IBNR"") asbestos claims are analyzed by a third-party specialist and reviewed by management annually. In 2014, management extended the forecast period from seven years to ten years. Based on a review of historical settlement trends, management concluded that ten years is the most probable time period in which unasserted asbestos claim filings and claim values can be estimated. The Company does not believe there is sufficient data to justify a projection period longer than ten years at this time. The change in the forecast period resulted in an immaterial increase in the asbestos reserves during 2014. Approximately 20% of the recorded undiscounted liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 80% is related to unasserted claims as of December 25, 2015.CSXT’s historical claim filings, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates are analyzed to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for asbestos claims reserves. The potentially exposed population is estimated by using CSXT’s employment records and industry data. From this analysis, the specialist estimates the IBNR claims liabilities.The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of asbestos IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims.Occupational claims arise from allegations of exposure to certain materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as “irritants”) and diesel fuels (like exhaust fumes) or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss.Environmental Environmental reserves were $94 million and $82 million for 2014 and 2015, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 242 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (""CERCLA""), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial. 40CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedIn accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:•type of clean-up required;•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location. Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statement.Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the cost of remedial actions currently required.LegalIn accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan AccountingThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. As of December 2015, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans were $3 billion and $314 million, respectively. No significant contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans are expected in 2016. 41CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedIn addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Eligible retirees who are age 65 years or older (Medicare-eligible) are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Eligible retirees younger than 65 years (non-Medicare eligible) are covered by a self-insured program partially funded by participating retirees. The life insurance plan is non-contributory.For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans.The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;•long-term rate of return on plan assets;•salary scale inflation rates; and•other assumptions.The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. These amounts are reviewed by management.Discount Rates Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2015 pension and post-retirement obligations are 4.30% and 3.85%, respectively. For 2014, the discount rate used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations was 4.00% and 3.60%, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2015, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years, respectively.Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change. 42CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedLong-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its pension obligation was 7.00% and 7.25% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.Salary Scale Inflation Rates Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.60% and 4.10% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, to value its pension obligations.Other AssumptionsThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are selected by management.2016 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement ExpenseNet pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2016 is expected to be approximately $58 million and $16 million, respectively, compared to $69 million and $17 million, respectively, in 2015. The decrease in expense is largely related to the impact of higher discount rates and historically favorable pension asset experience.The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, long-term rate of return and salaries on the 2015 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:(Dollars in Millions)Pension OPEBDiscount Rate 1% change$18 $2Long-term Rate of Return 1% change$22 N/ASalary Inflation 1% change$9 N/ADepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life MethodThe Company depreciates its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 86% of total fixed assets of $42 billion on a gross basis at December 2015. All other assets of the Company are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life. 43CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued The Company currently utilizes more than 130 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method of accounting. Examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets. All assets of the Company are depreciated on a time or life basis.The Company believes the group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g., track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets.Under the group-life method of accounting, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management's assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study (also referred to as a life study) is the periodic review of asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the STB, the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets generally every three years and for road (e.g. bridges and signals) and track (e.g., rail, ties and ballast) assets generally every six years. The Company believes the frequency currently required by the STB provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets. In 2014, the Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets. In 2012, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets and a technical update (an update to the prior depreciation study) for its road and track assets. The Company plans to complete the next depreciation study for road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2016.Changes in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations.There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;•evaluation of current operations;•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;•previous assessment of the condition of the assets;•management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies. 44CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedFor retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. As individual assets within a specific group are retired, resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation. This practice is consistent with accounting treatment normally prescribed under the group-life method. As part of the depreciation study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study. Since the overall assumption with group-life is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time.In the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales, resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately. These acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred. Examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage (e.g., major hurricanes), the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets (e.g., disposal of all refrigerated freight cars).Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively. A 1% change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $11 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. Income TaxesCSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2014. During 2015, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax year 2015. Management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2015, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $23 million.New Accounting Pronouncements and Change in Accounting PolicySee Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy.” 45CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the SEC, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements. The Company intends for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act may contain, among others, statements regarding: •projections and estimates of earnings, revenues, margins, volumes, rates, cost-savings, expenses, taxes or other financial items;•expectations as to results of operations and operational initiatives;•expectations as to the effect of claims, lawsuits, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, labor negotiations or agreements on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity;•management's plans, strategies and objectives for future operations, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, safety and service performance, proposed new services and other matters that are not historical facts, and management's expectations as to future performance and operations and the time by which objectives will be achieved; and•future economic, industry or market conditions or performance and their effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as ""will,"" ""should,"" “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate,” “preliminary” and similar expressions. The Company cautions against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect its good faith beliefs with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to it as of the date the forward-looking statement is made. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the timing when, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual performance or results could differ materially from those anticipated by any forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. If the Company does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be drawn that the Company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements. The following important factors, in addition to those discussed in Part II, Item 1A (Risk Factors) and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements: •legislative, regulatory or legal developments involving transportation, including rail or intermodal transportation, the environment, hazardous materials, taxation, and initiatives to further regulate the rail industry;•the outcome of litigation, claims and other contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge, environmental matters, taxes, shipper and rate claims subject to adjudication, personal injuries and occupational illnesses; 46CSX CORPORATIONPART II•changes in domestic or international economic, political or business conditions, including those affecting the transportation industry (such as the impact of industry competition, conditions, performance and consolidation) and the level of demand for products carried by CSXT;•natural events such as severe weather conditions, including floods, fire, hurricanes and earthquakes, a pandemic crisis affecting the health of the Company's employees, its shippers or the consumers of goods, or other unforeseen disruptions of the Company's operations, systems, property or equipment;•competition from other modes of freight transportation, such as trucking and competition and consolidation within the transportation industry generally; •the cost of compliance with laws and regulations that differ from expectations (including those associated with PTC implementation) as well as costs, penalties and operational and liquidity impacts associated with noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations;•the impact of increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas, including potential effects of high speed rail initiatives, or regulatory changes affecting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes;•unanticipated conditions in the financial markets that may affect timely access to capital markets and the cost of capital, as well as management's decisions regarding share repurchases; •changes in fuel prices, surcharges for fuel and the availability of fuel;•the impact of natural gas prices on coal-fired electricity generation;•availability of insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or insufficient insurance coverage to cover claims or damages;•the inherent business risks associated with safety and security, including the transportation of hazardous materials or a cybersecurity attack which would threaten the availability and vulnerability of information technology;•adverse economic or operational effects from actual or threatened war or terrorist activities and any governmental response;•labor and benefit costs and labor difficulties, including stoppages affecting either the Company's operations or customers' ability to deliver goods to the Company for shipment;•the Company's success in implementing its strategic, financial and operational initiatives; •changes in operating conditions and costs or commodity concentrations; and•the inherent uncertainty associated with projecting economic and business conditions.Other important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified elsewhere in this report and in CSX's other SEC reports, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Company's website at www.csx.com.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 2015, CSX does not have a material amount of floating rate debt obligations outstanding, and therefore fluctuations in the interest rate would not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 48CSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 8.

Risk Factors The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices. Legislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business. For instance, several of the proposals under consideration by the STB could have a significant negative impact on the Company's ability to negotiate prices for the value of rail services provided and meet service standards, which could force a reduction in capital spending. In addition, statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies and impact service performance. For example, the RSIA mandates that the installation of PTC hardware be completed by December 31, 2018 and, assuming certain conditions are met, requires that the PTC system be fully operational by December 31, 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. Noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Most of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention of the U.S. President), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, or if terms of existing agreements are disputed, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. Capacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency. CSXT may experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased volume; (ii) locomotive or crew shortages; (iii) extreme weather conditions; (iv) increased passenger activities, including high-speed rail; or (v) regulatory changes impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes, which could have a negative effect on CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 7CSX CORPORATIONPART IGlobal economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight. A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, if the rate of economic growth in Asia slows or if European economies contract, U.S. export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for CSX. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives, railcars and other equipment, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Over the past few years, production of natural gas in the U.S. has also increased dramatically, which has resulted in lower natural gas prices. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Additionally, depressed crude oil prices due to increased supply or lower demand could result in a further decrease in domestic crude oil production, which could have an adverse effect on crude oil volumes for CSX. In addition, new regulations related to the shipment of crude oil by rail, including proposed rail car safety standards, could increase costs for CSX, negatively impact network fluidity or have an adverse impact on customers. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate. CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 8CSX CORPORATIONPART IAny of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. Such an event could result in increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.Disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs. The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports, adverse political developments or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted. CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 9CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers.The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations. Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage. The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.The Company could be adversely impacted by actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the value of the Company’s securities.While the Company continually engages with shareholders and considers their views on business and strategy, responding to activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt operations and divert the attention of management and employees. The uncertainties associated with such activities could interfere with the Company’s ability to effectively execute its strategic plan, impact customer retention and long-term growth, and limit the Company's ability to hire and retain personnel. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of directors could require the Company to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and the board of directors. Uncertainties related to, or the results of, such activism could affect the market price and volatility of the Company's securities.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 10CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company is subject to adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates.The unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period.Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, the Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments as well as on bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNoneCSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 11CSX CORPORATIONPART IItem 2. Properties The Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern cities of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.CSXT’s track structure includes main thoroughfares, connecting terminals and yards (known as mainline track), track within terminals and switching yards, track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains, track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles are greater than CSXT’s approximately 21,000 route miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads. At December 2016, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track MilesMainline track26,530Terminals and switching yards9,396Passing sidings and turnouts937Total36,863In addition to its physical track structure, the Company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service. These serve as hubs between the Company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers often are received, re-sorted and placed onto new outbound trains. The Company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume (number of railcars or intermodal containers processed) are listed in the table below.Yards and TerminalsAnnualVolume(number of units processed)Chicago, IL (Bedford Park) - Intermodal1,136,124North Baltimore, OH (Northwest Ohio) - Intermodal809,254Waycross, GA677,003Selkirk, NY545,310Nashville, TN539,407Willard, OH515,335Cincinnati, OH496,299Indianapolis, IN496,235Hamlet, NC458,760Louisville, KY417,679CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 12CSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork Geography CSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent, high-speed intermodal, automotive and merchandise service. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, coal and intermodal.Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia, and provides access to major eastern ports.Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Southeast, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. The domestic coal market has declined significantly over the past several years and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility. CSXT’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Roughly one-third of the tons of export coal and the majority of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity.See the following pages for maps of the CSX Rail Network and CSX Intermodal Rail Network.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 13CSX CORPORATIONPART ICSX Rail NetworkCSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 14CSX CORPORATIONPART ICSX Intermodal Rail NetworkCSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 15CSX CORPORATIONPART ILocomotives At December 2016, CSXT owned 4,400 locomotives. From time to time, the Company also short-term leases locomotives based on business needs. Freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull trains. Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar is attached to the right train in order to deliver it to its final destination. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. At December 2016, CSXT’s fleet of owned locomotives consisted of the following types: Locomotives % Average Age(years)Freight3,880 88% 20Switching311 7% 37Auxiliary Units209 5% 24Total4,400 100% 20 Equipment In 2016, the average daily fleet of cars on line consisted of approximately 208,000 cars. At any time, over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by the Company. Examples of these include railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service), multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared between railroads) and doublestack railcars, or well cars (which are industry pooled), that allow for two intermodal containers to be loaded one above the other.At December 2016, the Company’s owned and long-term leased equipment consisted of the following:EquipmentNumber of Units %Gondolas23,802 37%Multi-level flat cars12,069 19%Open-top hoppers11,089 17%Covered hoppers10,030 15%Box cars7,151 11%Flat cars648 1%Other cars370 —%Subtotal freight cars65,159 100%Containers18,147 Total equipment83,306 CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 16CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company’s revenue-generating equipment, either owned or long-term leased, consists of freight cars and containers as described below. Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles.Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions.Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and industrial sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers.Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine.Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.Other cars – Primarily leased refrigerator cars and slab steel cars.Containers – Weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight.Item 3.

CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 21CSX CORPORATIONPART IICSX Purchases of Equity SecuritiesCSX purchases its own shares for two primary reasons: (1) to further its goals under its share repurchase program and (2) to fund the Company’s contribution required to be paid in CSX common stock under a 401(k) plan that covers certain union employees.In April 2015, the Company announced a $2 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by April 2017. Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guide the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances. During 2016, 2015, and 2014, CSX repurchased $1.1 billion or 38 million shares, $804 million or 26 million shares, and $517 million or 17 million shares, respectively, of common stock. Shares are retired immediately upon repurchase. In accordance with the Equity Topic in the Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC""), the excess of repurchase price over par value is recorded in retained earnings. Generally, retained earnings are only impacted by net earnings and dividends.

CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 25CSX CORPORATIONPART IISTRATEGIC OVERVIEW CSX provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers, as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations. The Company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the long-term economic success and improved global competitiveness of the United States. In addition, freight railroads provide the most economical and environmentally efficient means to transport goods over land. CSX's transportation solutions connect industries and population centers across the United States with each other and with global markets through access to over 70 port facilities allowing the Company to meet the dynamic transportation needs of manufacturers, industrial producers, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers, energy producers and the U.S. Armed Forces. Through its network, the Company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the country's needs. These products range from agricultural goods, such as grains, to chemicals, automobiles, metals, building materials, paper, consumer products, and energy sources like coal, ethanol and liquefied petroleum gas. The Company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business: merchandise, intermodal and coal. To support long-term growth and value creation consistent with the evolving trends in freight transportation, CSX has launched a new strategic initiative known as the CSX of Tomorrow: a safe, highly automated, resource-efficient railroad enabling Service Excellence, profitable growth and improved cash flow. The CSX of Tomorrow is comprised of four distinct strategic pillars and builds on the Company’s vision, purpose and core values. CSX of Tomorrow Strategic Initiatives Network of Tomorrow The CSX of Tomorrow relies on the reach, capability and efficiency of the Company’s rail network to safely and effectively meet the demands of the evolving marketplace and provide increasingly flexible and responsive service to more diverse customers. To facilitate future productivity and growth, CSX is implementing a fundamentally new approach to the network—transforming the railroad into two interconnected networks: a primary network and a local network. The Company is expanding capacity in its primary network to enable increasingly dense traffic while providing improved service for customers and enabling future growth. Further, the Company’s capacity investments along the primary network will allow for additional train lengthening, improving efficiency and profitability. The local network will be operated at lower density and speed and will better allow for new customer site development as a result of easier access to the local network and the Company’s enhanced focus on local pickup and delivery of freight to customers. Expanding capacity on U.S. rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation, increased business activity at U.S. ports, reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions. Therefore, CSX and its government partners are jointly working to invest in multi-year rail infrastructure projects. These public-private partnerships are a critical part of the Network of Tomorrow strategy for the Company. An example of one of these initiatives is the National Gateway, which is a public-private partnership that will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest for double-stack intermodal trains.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 26CSX CORPORATIONPART IIThe modernization of the Virginia Avenue Tunnel in Washington, D.C. is the capstone project for the second, and final phase, of the National Gateway. This project improves the flow of freight traffic through the District of Columbia and eliminates a rail traffic bottleneck that also impacts commuter and passenger trains in the region. CSX completed the first of two new double-stack-cleared tunnels in 2016, and the second tunnel will be finished in late 2018. With the completion of the first tunnel, 95% of CSX intermodal freight now moves in double-stack service. Going forward, CSX will continue to explore other opportunities to partner with the public sector to maximize the many public benefits of freight rail.Going forward, CSX will continue to explore other opportunities to partner with the public sector to maximize the many public benefits of freight rail. The Network of Tomorrow, along with enhanced operational efficiency, will allow CSX to continue to improve safety, lower the cost structure and provide superior service to customers.Service Excellence Service Excellence has long been a core component of CSX’s culture that engages all employees to focus on delivering value to customers through improved service levels, communications tools and advanced technologies. As part of the CSX of Tomorrow, the Company will continually strive to consistently meet, or exceed, customer commitments while ensuring all interactions with customers result in a positive experience. Improving the customer experience will allow CSX to continue delivering a safe, reliable and competitive product while enhancing the ability to profitably grow the business and continue to value price its service product. In addition, Service Excellence across the Network of Tomorrow will enable additional volume growth opportunities with new and existing customers, especially in the Company’s intermodal and merchandise businesses.For example, CSX’s intermodal network connects all major population centers east of the Mississippi River and positions the Company to capture a significant share of the growing domestic intermodal market opportunity, currently estimated at nine million truckloads in the eastern United States that move over 550 miles. The company’s highway-to-rail initiative assists in growing this traffic by helping customers identify new conversion opportunities for both domestic intermodal moves and the U.S. portion of international intermodal moves. To further enhance the Company’s intermodal offering and support future growth, CSX announced a new terminal in eastern North Carolina, known as the Carolina Connector, to capture local, regional, national and international intermodal freight movement opportunities prevalent in the vibrant mid-Atlantic market. This new terminal will be poised to replicate and leverage the success of the Northwest Ohio intermodal terminal by expanding the reach of the Company’s hub and spoke network strategy to provide further profitable growth, network connectivity and density, especially in smaller and mid-sized markets.CSX continues to proactively seek the right opportunities to profitably grow the merchandise business. The Company will continue capitalizing on new opportunities to locate industries on the CSX network, especially on the local network where network connectivity costs will generally be the lowest for customers. Through industrial development, the Company helps new and existing customers grow their business and target new markets by providing access to pre-certified locations as well as project management services. The Company’s coal markets have shifted dramatically over the past several years and continue to rapidly evolve. Domestic utility coal demand decreased again in 2016 relative to previous years while export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy, competition from foreign producers and regulatory impacts on coal mining in the United States. Longer-term, downward pressure on domestic utility coal volumes will likely persist as a result of continued low natural gas prices while global coal demand will likely be mixed as developing countries become more urbanized and industrialized countries continue to use an increasing amount of alternative fuels, other than coal, for electrical power generation. CSX will continue to provide a competitive service product amid coal’s market shifts while efficiently capitalizing on short-term demand fluctuations. CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 27CSX CORPORATIONPART IIHighly Automated Railroad For many years, CSX has utilized technology to enhance operational performance and decision-making. The CSX of Tomorrow will build upon this expertise and increasingly leverage technology (focusing on automation, advanced analytics and the use of mobility tools), innovation and process improvement. CSX is accelerating its technology investments to improve safety, resource efficiency, asset reliability and service levels for customers. Several key initiatives aimed at generating long-term value are focused on automating and optimizing critical operations across the Company. CSX will continue to implement specific workforce and regulatory strategies to ensure the safe, effective adoption of new technologies as the Company progresses towards becoming a Highly Automated Railroad.Team of Tomorrow CSX’s approximately 27,000 dedicated employees are the driving force behind the CSX of Tomorrow, contributing to the successful development and implementation of all strategic initiatives. As the CSX of Tomorrow requires an increasingly diverse skillset, the Team of Tomorrow will be a highly-capable, flexible, collaborative team, relentlessly focused on safety, service and value creation. To attract, retain and motivate the best talent in the marketplace, CSX will continue to provide a compelling value proposition for its employees. The Company is going to further enhance its investment in employee development, provide career opportunities, have market-competitive employee benefits and continue to reward the creation of customer and employee excellence. Through the Team of Tomorrow initiative, CSX strives to align our people with a culture that embraces the Company’s vision, purpose and core values, to safely and efficiently serve our customers and help ensure the successful implementation of the CSX of Tomorrow. Balanced Approach to Cash Deployment CSX remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business, dividend growth and share repurchases. In 2016, the Company invested $2.7 billion to further enhance the safety, reliability, efficiency, flexibility and capability of its network and its overall business. In addition, during 2016, CSX repaid $1.4 billion in outstanding debt to capitalize on the lower interest rate environment.The Company continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During 2016, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per common share, with total dividends paid to shareholders of $680 million for the year. Also in 2016, CSX continued share repurchases under its $2.0 billion program which began in 2015 and is expected to be completed by April 2017. CSX repurchased $1.1 billion, or 38 million shares, during 2016 under this program. As part of this balanced approach, the Company is committed to maintaining a credit profile consistent with a BBB+ rating by Standard & Poor’s and a Baa1 rating by Moody’s Investment Services.SummaryThe strategic initiatives and opportunities, as well as the strategic investments discussed above, provide a foundation for volume growth, continued value pricing, productivity improvement, enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations. To continue these types of investments, the Company must be able to operate in a balanced regulatory environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value. These investments will enable the Company to deliver the CSX of Tomorrow: a safe, highly automated, resource-efficient railroad enabling Service Excellence, profitable growth and improved cash flow.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 28CSX CORPORATIONPART II2016 HIGHLIGHTS• Revenue of $11.1 billion decreased $742 million or six percent versus the prior year.• Expenses of $7.7 billion decreased $547 million or seven percent year over year.• Operating income of $3.4 billion decreased $195 million or five percent year over year.• Operating ratio of 69.4 percent improved 30 basis points from 69.7 percent.•Earnings per diluted share of $1.81 decreased $0.19 or 10 percent year over year.

The revenue impact of the extra week was $178 million.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 30CSX CORPORATIONPART IIRevenueIn 2016, revenue decreased $742 million, or six percent, due to a five percent decline in volume (including the $178 million positive impact of an extra week of volume) and a significant decline in fuel recoveries, partially offset by pricing strength.MerchandiseAgriculturalAgricultural and Food Products - Volume declined as the strong U.S. dollar continued to support import grain and a robust Southeastern crop spurred additional local truck sourcing, displacing grain shipments by rail. Additionally, ethanol market dynamics shifted to favor the Gulf region for storage and export, precluding CSX from participation in shipments from Western origins to the Gulf.Fertilizers - Volume was flat as the strong U.S. dollar, which drove high levels of imported sulfur, displaced rail transport, and nitrogen demand fell in anticipation of further commodity price deterioration. This offset growth in phosphate rock, driven by operational efficiency that allowed for additional rail traffic conversion that would otherwise move by truck.IndustrialChemicals - Volume declined as energy market headwinds significantly reduced crude oil and frac sand shipments. This reduction was partially offset by the ramp up of a fly ash remediation project and a modest increase in core chemical markets. Automotive - Volume increased as a result of strong North American light vehicle production and growth across several customers. Additionally, movement of trucks and SUVs continued to outpace passenger cars, consistent with customer buying patterns.Metals and Equipment - Volume was down as the strong U.S. dollar allowed for continued high levels of steel imports, which led to reduced domestic steel production, mill closures and the loss of associated rail moves. These declines were partially offset by strength in the wind-energy and power generation markets.Housing and ConstructionMinerals - Volume was up slightly due to strong gains in aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel), particularly for highway and non-residential construction in southern markets. The growth was partially offset by headwinds in salt and lime, reflecting mild winter weather and steel production challenges, respectively.Forest Products - Volume declined as headwinds from electronic substitution and reduced paper products demand drove industry consolidation that reduced rail volume. Further, excess truck capacity in 2016 captured some volume that traditionally moved by rail.CoalDomestic - Volume declined as mild winter weather in the beginning of the year and low natural gas prices reduced utility coal burn rates and resulted in inflated coal stockpiles. Further, the weak domestic integrated steel market drove volume decreases in coke.Export - Volume was down in both metallurgical and thermal coal as a result of the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply which impacted U.S. competitiveness in the world market, particularly in the first half of the year.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 31CSX CORPORATIONPART IIIntermodalDomestic - Volume increased as secular growth from the highway-to-rail conversion program and new service offerings were partially offset by excess truck capacity headwinds and a short-haul competitive loss.International - Volume declined as headwinds from competitive losses more than offset moderate growth across other customers. Other Other revenue decreased $110 million versus prior year primarily due to payments received in 2015 from customers that did not meet volume commitments. Further decreases in incidental revenue as well as lower coal revenue from affiliates were partially offset by adjustments to revenue reserves.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 32CSX CORPORATIONPART IIExpenseIn 2016, total expenses decreased $547 million, or seven percent, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.

These expenses decreased $131 million due to the following items:•Efficiency savings of $249 million were driven by lower T&E and operating support costs as a result of structural changes, reduced crew training and the Company's train length initiative that began in the second quarter of 2015.•Volume-related costs were $116 million lower.•Incentive compensation was $111 million higher reflecting the expected award payouts on existing plans.•Inflation resulted in $106 million of additional cost driven by increased health and welfare costs.•The extra week resulted in $51 million of additional cost.•Restructuring costs decreased $37 million due to the 2015 workforce reduction initiatives costs that nearly all occurred in 2015.•Various other costs increased $3 million.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and coal pier services and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expenses decreased $267 million driven by the following:•Real estate gains increased $98 million primarily related to a current year gain of $115 million related to the sale of an operating property and other related income partially offset by a prior year real estate gain.•Efficiency savings of $95 million were primarily related to lower operating support costs driven by structural changes and broad cost containment.•Train accident and casualty costs were $70 million lower due to the continuing declines in the severity of train accidents as well as injuries.•Inflation resulted in $34 million of additional costs.•The extra week resulted in $18 million of additional cost.•Volume-related costs were $11 million lower.•Various other costs decreased $45 million.Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $244 million driven by the following:•Average fuel price per gallon decreased 18 percent, from $1.80 to $1.48 per gallon versus the prior year, which reduced expenses by $137 million.•Efficiency savings of $60 million were primarily related to locomotive fuel reduction technology and process improvement.•Volume-related costs were $58 million lower.•The extra week resulted in $15 million of additional cost.•Various other costs decreased $4 million.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 33CSX CORPORATIONPART IIDepreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $93 million due to a larger asset base and the $25 million impact of the extra week in 2016.Equipment and Other expenses include rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $2 million driven by the following:•Inflation resulted in $18 million of additional cost primarily related to rates on automotive freight cars.•Volume related costs were $14 million higher due primarily to growth in automotive volume.•The extra week resulted in $7 million of additional cost.•Efficiency savings of $23 million were due to improved car cycle times.•Net other costs decreased $14 million.Interest Expense increased $35 million to $579 million due to higher average debt balances in addition to $11 million of additional expense related to the extra week in 2016, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Debt Repurchase Expense increased to $115 million due to the repurchase of certain notes that were expected to mature in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Other Income (Expense) - net decreased $52 million to $46 million primarily due to a prior year $59 million gain on a sale of non-operating easements and reimbursement of environmental costs of $21 million related to this sale. This decrease was partially offset by other non-operating items, none of which were individually significant.Income Tax Expense decreased $143 million to $1.0 billion primarily due to lower earnings.Net Earnings decreased $254 million to $1.7 billion, and earnings per diluted share decreased $0.19 to $1.81 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding resulting from higher share repurchase activity had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 34CSX CORPORATIONPART II2015 vs. 2014 Results of Operations Fiscal Years 2015 2014 $ Change % Change (Dollars in Millions) Revenue$11,811 $12,669 $(858) (7)% Expense Labor and Fringe3,290 3,377 87 3 Materials, Supplies and Other2,336 2,484 148 6 Fuel957 1,616 659 41 Depreciation1,208 1,151 (57) (5) Equipment and Other Rents436 428 (8) (2) Total Expense8,227 9,056 829 9 Operating Income3,584 3,613 (29) (1) Interest Expense(544) (545) 1 — Debt Repurchase Expense— (16) 16 125 Other Income - Net98 (8) 106 (1,325) Income Tax Expense(1,170) (1,117) (53) (5) Net Earnings$1,968 $1,927 $41 2 Earnings Per Diluted Share: Net Earnings$2.00 $1.92 $0.08 4 % Operating Ratio69.7% 71.5% 180bpsCSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 35CSX CORPORATIONPART II2015 vs. 2014 Results of Operations, continuedVolume and Revenue (Unaudited) Volume (Thousands of units); Revenue (Dollars in Millions); Revenue Per Unit (Dollars) Volume Revenue Revenue Per Unit 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % ChangeAgricultural Agricultural and Food Products (a)503 513 (2)% $1,345 $1,395 (4)% $2,674 $2,719 (2)%Fertilizers (a)301 330 (9) 489 534 (8) 1,625 1,618 —Industrial Chemicals (a)726 728 — 2,284 2,375 (4) 3,146 3,262 (4)Automotive450 435 3 1,175 1,213 (3) 2,611 2,789 (6)Metals and Equipment (a)284 331 (14) 723 824 (12) 2,546 2,489 2Housing and Construction Minerals (a)306 288 6 459 448 2 1,500 1,556 (4)Forest Products290 307 (6) 796 819 (3) 2,745 2,668 3Total Merchandise2,860 2,932 (2) 7,271 7,608 (4) 2,542 2,595 (2)Coal1,063 1,262 (16) 2,300 2,849 (19) 2,164 2,258 (4)Intermodal2,838 2,728 4 1,762 1,790 (2) 621 656 (5)Other— — — 478 422 13 — — —Total6,761 6,922 (2)% $11,811 $12,669 (7)% $1,747 $1,830 (5)%(a) In order to better align markets with the Company's business strategy, changes were made to the categorization of certain lines of business during the third quarter 2016. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation and are posted on the Company's website at csx.com under the investors section.•Agricultural and Food Products includes the combination of the previous Agricultural Products and Food and Consumer markets.•Fertilizers was previously named Phosphates and Fertilizers.•Metals and Equipment includes the Equipment portion of the previous Waste and Equipment market. •Chemicals includes the Waste portion of the previous Waste and Equipment market. Chemicals also includes fly ash forremediation purposes (a form of waste) which was previously included within the Minerals market.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 36CSX CORPORATIONPART IIRevenueIn 2015, revenue decreased $858 million, or seven percent, mostly due to the decline in fuel surcharge of $646 million. Additionally, the decline in volume of two percent and unfavorable mix were partially offset by pricing strength.MerchandiseAgriculturalAgricultural and Food Products - Volume declined due to challenging world market conditions and a strong U.S. dollar. Specifically, high levels of imported ethanol reduced rail moves to Eastern markets and the strong dollar hampered export grain competitiveness. Additionally, excess truck capacity led to lower shipments of food products. These declines were partially offset by strength in feed grain and domestic soybean moves, reflecting the record 2014-2015 harvest.Fertilizers - Volume was down, reflecting weak demand driven by oversupply of fertilizer, low corn prices and a challenged export market due to strength of the U.S. dollar.IndustrialChemicals - Volume was flat as strong gains in LPG and petroleum products were offset by the slowdown in crude oil and frac sand due to low oil prices and the conclusion of major waste remediation projects. Automotive - Volume increased as gains in auto movement, especially SUVs and trucks, resulted from strong North American light vehicle production and consumer demand.Metals and Equipment - Volume declined primarily due to high levels of steel imports which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar and led to lower production of domestic steel.Housing and ConstructionMinerals - Volume growth reflects strength in aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) due to increased highway and non-residential construction activity.Forest Products - Volume declines reflect high inventories of building products in the housing sector as well as declining demand due to electronic substitution in paper products.CoalDomestic - Volume declined as a result of mild weather, high stockpiles and low natural gas prices favoring natural gas power generation.Export - Reductions in both metallurgical and thermal coal volume resulted from ongoing weak market conditions due to global oversupply and the strength of the U.S. dollar.IntermodalDomestic - Domestic volume increased 12 percent due to customer growth, continued success with CSX’s highway-to-rail conversion program and new service offerings.International - Competitive losses resulted in a five percent international volume decline during a volatile year marked by West Coast port disruption, a subsequent volume surge and then a weak peak season.Other Other revenue increased $56 million as a result of higher revenue from customers who did not meetminimum contractual volumes as well as higher incidental revenue.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 37CSX CORPORATIONPART IIExpenseIn 2015, total expenses decreased $829 million, or nine percent, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $87 million due to the following items:•Inflation resulted in $128 million of additional cost driven by increased wages partially offset by reduced health and welfare costs.•Incentive compensation was $97 million lower reflecting reduced award payouts on existing plans.•Efficiency savings of $84 million were primarily a result of reduced crew starts due to the Company's train length initiatives, lower operating support costs and reduced management headcount.•Volume-related costs were $66 million lower.•Restructuring costs were $2 million higher versus prior year. See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “Workforce Reduction Plans, Separation and Other Costs.”•Various other costs increased $30 million.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal services at automotive facilities and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expenses decreased$148 million driven by the following:•Efficiency savings of $91 million were driven by a reduction in professional costs as well as lower operating support costs.•Volume-related costs were $52 million lower.•Real estate gains were $23 million higher primarily related to the sale of operating rail corridor.•Inflation resulted in $47 million of additional costs.•Various other costs decreased $29 million.Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $659 million driven by the following:•Average fuel price per gallon decreased 39 percent, from $2.95 to $1.80 per gallon, versus the prior year which reduced expenses by $560 million.•Volume-related costs were $66 million lower.•Other fuel savings of $33 million were primarily due to lower non-locomotive fuel price.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $57 million due to a larger asset base.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 38CSX CORPORATIONPART IIEquipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $8 million driven by the following:•Inflation resulted in $16 million of additional cost related to rates on automotive and intermodal cars.•Efficiency savings of $15 million were due to improved car cycle times.•Net other costs increased $7 million.Interest Expense decreased $1 million to $544 million due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average debt balances.Debt Repurchase Expense decreased $16 million associated with costs incurred in 2014 related to the early redemption of long-term debt did not repeat in the current year.Other Income (Expense) - net increased $122 million to $98 million primarily due to a $59 million gain on a sale of non-operating easements and a reimbursement of environmental costs of $21 million related to this sale. Additionally, 2015 environmental costs were $21 million lower than 2014.Income Tax Expense increased $53 million to $1.2 billion primarily due to higher earnings as well as prior year favorable state legislative changes that did not repeat in the current year.Net Earnings increased $41 million to $2.0 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.08 to $2.00 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding resulting from higher share repurchase activity also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 39CSX CORPORATIONPART IIOperating Statistics (Estimated) Fiscal Years 2016 2015 Improvement/ (Deterioration)Safety and Service Measurements FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index1.02 0.94 (9)%FRA Train Accident Rate2.62 2.61 —On-Time Train Originations84% 67% 25On-Time Destination Arrivals65% 51% 27Dwell25.7 25.8 —Train Velocity20.8 20.5 1Cars-On-Line207,943 206,078 (1)Certain operating statistics are estimated and can continue to be updated as actuals settle.Key Performance Measures DefinitionsFRA Personal Injury Frequency Index - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours.FRA Train Accident Rate - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.On-Time Train Originations - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.On-Time Destination Arrivals - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time or earlier to two hours late (30 minutes for intermodal trains).Dwell - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival at and departure from the yard. It does not include cars moving through the yard on the same train. Train Velocity - Average train speed between terminals in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains).Cars-On-Line - An average count of all cars on the network (does not include locomotives, cabooses, trailers, containers or maintenance equipment). The Company measures and reports safety and service performance. The Company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training, innovation and investment. CSX's safety and train accident prevention programs rely on the latest tools, programs and employee participation that are designed to continuously strengthen the safety culture. Increased investment in training and technology also is designed to allow CSX employees to have an additional layer of protection that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents. The Company's safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities.Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance. CSX has established formal relationships with industry groups, leading universities and suppliers to develop, implement and deploy the latest technology that can detect infrastructure problems before they happen. To illustrate, through a waiver granted by the FRA, CSX is using advanced continuous rail testing methods that are being adopted by other railroads as the system’s value is proven. The Company constantly collaborates with the FRA and industry organizations as well as federal, state and local governments on safety innovations and initiatives. For example, CSX and other freight railroads have actively worked with the U.S. DOT and other key stakeholders to evaluate and implement far-reaching safety enhancements for transportation of certain flammable materials, including essential energy products, on the nation’s freight railroad network. CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 40CSX CORPORATIONPART IIAt CSX, operational success is built on employee commitment to maintaining a constant focus on safety. Although the number of FRA reportable personal injuries decreased 10 percent year-over-year, the FRA reportable personal injury frequency index increased 9 percent to 1.02 due to a 17 percent decrease in labor hours versus 2015. While the reported FRA train accident frequency rate has remained flat year-over-year at 2.62, both overall FRA train accidents and train miles have decreased 14 percent year-over-year. The Company made strong improvements to network reliability and service measures in 2016 while delivering a record level of productivity. On-time originations improved 25 percent year-over-year to 84 percent, and on-time arrivals increased 27 percent year-over-year to 65 percent. Terminal dwell remained flat at 25.7 hours versus 2015 and average train velocity increased one percent to 20.8 miles per hour.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed.Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash FlowsConsolidated Balance SheetsCSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases.Total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $669 million from prior year. The increase in assets was driven by higher net properties of $976 million resulting from capital investments, partially offset by payments of about $300 million made on debt related to assets purchased in 2015 under seller financing. The increase in total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined was driven by an increase in net borrowings of about $450 million (including payments made on debt for assets purchased in 2015 under seller financing) and an increase in deferred income tax liabilities of $417 million. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in other long-term liabilities due to voluntary pension contributions of $250 million.Significant cash flowsThe following charts present net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2014, 2015 and 2016. CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 41CSX CORPORATIONPART IISources of CashThe Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2016, the Company generated $3.0 billion of cash from operating activities which was $329 million lower than prior year primarily driven by $250 million in voluntary contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans. In 2015, the Company generated $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities which was $27 million higher than 2014 primarily driven by higher collections of freight account receivables.Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2020. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information.Third, CSX filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in February 2016 which is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.Uses of CashCSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion from the prior year primarily driven by lower net purchases of short-term investments and lower property additions. In 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion, an increase in net investing of $709 million from 2014 primarily driven by fewer net sales of short-term investments. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

These partnership investments are for projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. (b)In 2016, CSX made payments related to locomotive purchases made in 2015 using seller financing of $307 million. CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 42CSX CORPORATIONPART IIPlanned capital investments for 2017 are expected to be $2.2 billion, including about $270 million for PTC. This $2.2 billion excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in the year the reimbursement obligation arises. Approximately half of the 2017 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. The remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives, freight cars and high return projects supporting long-term profitable growth, productivity initiatives and service improvements to optimize performance. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations.The Company expects to continue incurring significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC. CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be approximately $2.4 billion. This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. Total PTC spending through 2016 was $1.8 billion. In addition to capital investments, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases, share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders. In 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $1.3 billion, which represents an increase in spending of $749 million from the prior year primarily driven by the repayment of seller-financed assets, higher share repurchases, and lower net debt issued. In 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $519 million, which represents a decrease in spending of $564 million from the prior year primarily driven by higher net long-term debt issued of $904 million (net of lower debt repayments) partially offset by higher share repurchases of $287 million.CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Liquidity and Working CapitalCurrently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $1.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX has a $1 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility expires in May 2020 and as of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. Additionally in 2016, CSX issued a total of $2.2 billion of new long-term debt, $1.4 billion of which was used to repay outstanding debt, to capitalize on the lower interest rate environment. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time, repurchases of CSX's common stock, capital investments, working capital requirements and improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements. In September 2016, the Company renewed and modified its existing receivables securitization facility. The facility was extended with a three-year term scheduled to expire in September 2019. It was modified to provide liquidity of up to $200 million, changed from the $250 million, along with modifications to other terms. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity. Under the terms of this facility, CSXT transfers eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX services the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. In the event CSX Trade Receivables draws under this facility, the Company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 43CSX CORPORATIONPART IIWorking capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $447 million at December 2016 and $888 million (after reclassification of current deferred taxes) at December 2015. This decrease since the prior year end is primarily due to an increase in long-term debt maturing within a year of $311 million and cash from operations used for property additions, share repurchases and dividend payments.The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.Credit Ratings Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings remained stable during 2016. As of December 2015 and December 2016, S&P's long-term rating on CSX was BBB+ (Stable), and Moody's was Baa1 (Stable). Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 44CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFree Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Measure)Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G and Reg S-K Item 10(e). Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. Free cash flow before dividends decreased $145 million year-over-year to $847 million. The decrease in free cash flow from the prior year is primarily due to voluntary contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans of $250 million in 2016, partially offset by lower property additions of $164 million. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure).

These partnership investments of $41 million, $14 million and $8 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore, the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. Also, property additions for 2016 above do not include $307 million for locomotives purchased in 2015 using seller financing with payment made in 2016.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 45CSX CORPORATIONPART IISCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTSThe following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other significant commitments: Type of Obligation20172018201920202021ThereafterTotal(Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations Total Debt (See Note 9)$331$20$18$745$371$9,808$11,293Interest on Debt5395235215094978,65711,246Purchase Obligations (See Note 7)3633363123163103,9435,580Other Post-Employment Benefits (See Note 8) (a)5443414038165381Operating Leases - Net (See Note 7) (b)483632191072217Agreements with Conrail (See Note 12) (b)272727272774209Total Contractual Obligations$1,362$985$951$1,656$1,253$22,719$28,926 Other Commitments (c)$110$3$2$2$2$2$121(a)Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans which are unfunded. No amounts are included for funded pension obligations as no contributions are currently required.(b)Agreements with Conrail represent minimum future lease payments of $209 million under the shared asset area agreements (see Note 12, Related Party Transactions). These amounts plus total operating leases-net of $217 million above equals total net lease commitments of $426 million disclosed in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.(c)Other commitments of $121 million consisted of surety bonds, letters of credit, uncertain tax positions and public private partnerships. Surety bonds of $48 million and letters of credit of $33 million arise from assurances issued by a third-party that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement. Uncertain tax positions of $25 million, which include interest and penalties, are all included in year 2017 as the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated. Contractual commitments related to public-private partnerships are $15 million.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSFor detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 46CSX CORPORATIONPART IICRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:•casualty, environmental and legal reserves;•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and•income taxes. Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves CasualtyCasualty reserves of $229 million and $269 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, represent accruals for personal injury, occupational disease and occupational injury claims. A majority of the casualty reserves relate to personal injuries. The Company's self-insured retention amount for these claims is $50 million per occurrence. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in estimate. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. Most of the Company's casualty claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. Personal InjuryPersonal Injury reserves of $170 million and $204 million for 2016 and 2015, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to FELA. In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other current or former CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act. CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience.As a direct result of improvements in safety in recent years, the Company has experienced a downward trend in the severity of injuries which has resulted in a decrease in the estimate of costs per incident. During 2016, the Company reduced casualty reserves, primarily personal injury reserves, by $28 million, resulting in after-tax effect on earnings from continuing operations and net earnings of $18 million and an after-tax effect on earnings per share of $0.02. The personal injury reserve reductions were included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. During 2015 and 2014, there were no significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust casualty reserves.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 47CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedOccupationalOccupational reserves of $59 million and $65 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, represent liabilities for occupational disease claims and occupational injury claims. Occupational disease claims arise primarily from allegations of exposure to asbestos in the workplace. Occupational injury claims arise from allegations of exposure to certain other materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as “irritants”) and diesel fuels (like exhaust fumes) or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries. The Company has experienced a downward trend in the number of occupational claims and reserves for these claims have decreased to a level that is no longer material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.EnvironmentalEnvironmental reserves were $95 million and $82 million and 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 222 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (""CERCLA""), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.In accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:•type of clean-up required;•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 48CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedBased on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are reasonably estimable and probable. The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statement.Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the cost of remedial actions currently required.LegalIn accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan AccountingThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. As of December 2016, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $2.9 billion.In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Eligible retirees who are age 65 years or older (Medicare-eligible) are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Eligible retirees younger than 65 years (non-Medicare eligible) are covered by a self-insured program partially funded by participating retirees. The life insurance plan is non-contributory. As of December 2016, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s other post-retirement benefit plans was $274 million.For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 49CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedThe accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;•long-term rate of return on plan assets;•salary scale inflation rates; and•other assumptions.The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. These amounts are reviewed by management.Discount Rates Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2016 pension and post-retirement obligations are 4.08 percent and 3.71 percent, respectively. For 2015, the discount rate used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations was 4.30 percent and 3.85 percent, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2016, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and eight years, respectively. Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75 percent and 7 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 50CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedSalary Scale Inflation Rates Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.60 percent in both 2016 and 2015 to value its pension obligations.Other AssumptionsThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.2017 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement ExpenseNet pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense for 2017 are each expected to be approximately $10 million, compared to $58 million and $17 million, respectively, in 2016. The decrease in expense is primarily due to a change in approach to measuring service and interest costs, the impact of $250 million in voluntary pension contributions and other favorable plan experience.In 2017, the Company will measure the service and interest cost components of the net pension and post-retirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weighted-average discount rate approach, which has been used in prior years. The Company made this change to improve the correlation between projected pension and post-retirement benefit liability cash flows and the corresponding spot discount rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity. The calculated pension and post-retirement benefits liabilities are consistent under both the traditional and spot rate approaches. The Company accounted for this change on a prospective basis as a change in accounting estimate. The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a one percent change in certain assumptions like discount rates, long-term rate of return and salaries on the 2017 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:(Dollars in Millions) Pension Expense Post-Retirement ExpenseDiscount Rate $15 $1Long-term Rate of Return $26 N/ASalary Inflation $9 N/ACSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 51CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued Depreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life MethodThe Company depreciates its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 86 percent of total fixed assets of $43 billion on a gross basis at December 2016. All other assets of the Company are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life.The Company currently utilizes more than 130 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method of accounting. Examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets. All assets of the Company are depreciated on a time or life basis.The Company believes the group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g., track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets.Management performs a detailed review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method of accounting, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management's assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study (also referred to as a life study) is the periodic review of asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the STB, the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets generally every three years and for road (e.g. bridges and signals) and track (e.g., rail, ties and ballast) assets generally every six years. The Company believes the frequency currently required by the STB provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets. In 2016, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets. In 2014, the Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets. The Company plans to complete the next depreciation study for road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2019.Changes in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations.CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 52CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedThere are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;•evaluation of current operations;•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;•previous assessment of the condition of the assets;•management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies. Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes that did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. A 1% change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $12 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. As individual assets within a specific group are retired, resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation. This practice is consistent with accounting treatment normally prescribed under the group-life method. As part of the depreciation study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study. Since the overall assumption with group-life is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time.In the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales, resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately. These acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred. Examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage (e.g., major hurricanes), the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets (e.g., disposal of all refrigerated freight cars).Income TaxesCSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. CSX 2016 Form 10-K p. 53CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedCSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2015. During 2016, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax year 2016. Management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2016, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $25 million.New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting PolicySee Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy.”FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the SEC, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements.

Risk FactorsThe risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.Legislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business. For instance, several of the proposals under consideration by the STB could have a significant negative impact on the Company's ability to negotiate prices for the value of rail services provided and meet service standards, which could force a reduction in capital spending. In addition, statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies and impact service performance. For example, the RSIA mandates that the installation of PTC hardware be completed by December 31, 2018 and, assuming certain conditions are met, requires that the PTC system be fully operational by December 31, 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. Although CSX remains on track to meet this regulatory requirement, noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. The Company’s business strategies may not achieve the anticipated objectives.The implementation of the Company’s business strategies could result in operational disruptions, loss of existing customers, regulatory issues and other adverse consequences. If these strategies fail to achieve the anticipated benefits or take longer to implement than expected, the Company’s operations and financial results may be adversely affected.Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 70 percent of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention of the U.S. President), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, or if terms of existing agreements are disputed, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into CSX-specific, or “local”, bargaining agreements which could also be critical to the Company and its new business strategies.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 8CSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency.CSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased volume; (ii) locomotive or crew shortages; (iii) extreme weather conditions; (iv) impacts from changes in yard capacity, or network structure or composition, including train routes; (v) increased passenger activities, including high-speed rail; or (vi) regulatory changes impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes, which could have a negative effect on CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.Global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, if the rate of economic growth in Asia slows, European economies contract, or if the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal changes from its current levels, U.S. export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for CSX. Additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Over the past few years, production and source locations of natural gas in the U.S. have also increased dramatically, which has resulted in lower natural gas prices in CSX’s service territory. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Additionally, crude oil prices combined with increased pipeline activity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production, which has adversely affected crude oil volumes for CSX.CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 9CSX CORPORATIONPART IClimate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. Such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages. A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect. CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 10CSX CORPORATIONPART IDisruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.The Company faces competition from other transportation providers.The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 11CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates.The unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and conductors, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period. Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, the Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments as well as on bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNoneCSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 12CSX CORPORATIONPART IItem 2. Properties The Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.Track and InfrastructureServing 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern cities of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.CSXT’s track structure includes mainline track, connecting terminals and yards, track within terminals and switching yards, sidings used for passing trains, track connecting CSXT's track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads, are greater than CSXT’s approximately 21,000 route miles. At December 2017, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track MilesMainline track26,500Terminals and switching yards9,348Passing sidings and turnouts920Total36,768In addition to its physical track structure, the Company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service. These serve as points of connectivity between the Company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers are received, classed for destination and placed onto outbound trains, or arrive and are delivered to the customer. In 2017, CSX converted a number of hump yards to flat switching operations which allows for less intermediate processing and the opportunity to improve transit time. The Company’s largest yards and terminals based on 2017 volume (number of railcars or intermodal containers processed) are listed below.Yards and TerminalsChicago, IL - Bedford Park Intermodal TerminalNorth Baltimore, OH - Northwest Ohio Intermodal TerminalWaycross, GACincinnati, OHSelkirk, NYAvon, IN (Indianapolis)Willard, OHNashville, TNLouisville, KYHamlet, NCCSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 13CSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork GeographyCSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These engineering attributes permit the corridor to support high-speed service across intermodal, automotive and merchandise commodities. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, coal and intermodal.Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia, and provides access to major eastern ports.Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Southeast, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. The domestic coal market has declined significantly over the past several years and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility. CSXT’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Roughly one-third of the tons of export coal and the majority of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity.See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network.

From time to time, the Company also short-term leases locomotives based on business needs. Freight locomotives are used primarily to pull trains while switching locomotives are used in yards. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. At December 2017, CSXT’s fleet of owned locomotives consisted of the following types: Locomotives % Average Age(years)Freight3,659 88% 20Switching299 7% 37Auxiliary Units208 5% 24Total4,166 100% 20 EquipmentAt any time, over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by the Company. Examples of these include railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service), multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared between railroads) and doublestack railcars, or well cars (which are industry pooled), that allow for two intermodal containers to be loaded one above the other.At December 2017, the Company’s owned and long-term leased equipment consisted of the following:EquipmentNumber of Units %Gondolas21,209 35%Multi-level flat cars11,686 19%Open-top hoppers10,298 17%Covered hoppers9,623 16%Box cars6,374 11%Flat cars624 1%Other cars337 —%Subtotal freight cars60,151 100%Containers18,088 Total equipment78,239 CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 16CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company’s revenue-generating equipment, either owned or long-term leased, consists of freight cars and containers as described below. Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles.Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions.Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and industrial sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers.Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine.Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.Other cars – Primarily leased refrigerator cars and slab steel cars.Containers – Weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight.Item 3.

CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 25CSX CORPORATIONPART II2017 HIGHLIGHTS• Revenue of $11.4 billion increased $339 million or three percent versus the prior year.• Expenses of $7.7 billion increased $61 million or one percent year over year.• Operating income of $3.7 billion increased $278 million or eight percent year over year.• Operating ratio of 67.9 percent improved 150 basis points from 69.4 percent.•Earnings per diluted share of $5.99 increased $4.18 or 231 percent year over year. Tax ReformWith the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Act"") on December 22, 2017, the federal corporate income tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company's 2017 financial results included a $3.5 billion, or $3.81 per share, non-cash reduction in income tax expense, primarily resulting from revaluing the Company's net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the recently enacted lower tax rate effective January 1, 2018. Beginning in 2018, CSX expects its effective federal and state income tax rate to be approximately 25%. The Company's affiliates also revalued their deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower federal corporate tax rate, which resulted in the Company recognizing a benefit of $142 million, or $0.10 per share after-tax, in equity earnings of affiliates, which is included in operating income. (See additional discussion over income taxes in Note 11, Income Taxes and equity earnings of affiliates in Note 12, Related Parties and Affiliates.)Restructuring ChargeThe total restructuring charge of $325 million in 2017 includes costs related to the management workforce reduction, executive retirements, reimbursement arrangements, the proration of equity awards and other advisory costs related to the leadership transition during the year. The Company expects estimated pre-tax savings on both future earnings and cash flows resulting from this program to be approximately $200 million per year.

All 2016 information presented in Results of Operations is on a 53-week basis, under GAAP.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 28CSX CORPORATIONPART IIRevenueIn 2017, revenue increased $339 million when compared to the previous year, primarily due to gains in export coal, price increases across nearly all other markets and fuel recovery, partially offset by the $178 million impact of an extra fiscal week in 2016 and lower merchandise volumes. Revenue per unit increased over prior year as pricing gains and higher fuel recoveries were partially offset by unfavorable mix.MerchandiseChemicals - Volume declined, primarily due to sustained challenges in the Eastern crude-by-rail market. This decline offset an increase in shipments of frac sand and petroleum gases due to growth in drilling activity. Automotive - Volume declined as North American vehicle production fell.Agricultural and Food Products - Volume declined due to challenges in the export market as well as a large southeastern grain crop leading to local truck sourcing to feed mills. Minerals - Volume slightly declined as short-term competitive losses were mostly offset by growth in construction project activity.Fertilizers - Volume declined, primarily driven by the closure of a customer facility as well as Hurricane Irma’s impact on Central Florida phosphate operations.Forest Products - Volume declined as the decrease in shipments of paper products as a result of mill closures and truck competition was partially offset by strong pulp board volumes driven by e-commerce demand.Metals and Equipment - Volume slightly declined as a nonrecurring 2016 benefit from large pipe projects was partially offset by increases in equipment moves.CoalDomestic - Utility coal volume declined 12 percent as the competitive loss of short-haul interchange traffic more than offset underlying growth at other utilities. Coke, Iron Ore and Other volume declined 13 percent, primarily in iron ore shipments, as a large customer temporarily halted its production.Export - Volume increased 42 percent as global supply levels and pricing conditions supported strong growth in U.S. coal exports.IntermodalDomestic - Volume declined 2 percent as rationalization of low-density lanes and competitive losses more than offset growth with existing customers.International - Volume was up 7 percent driven by competitive gains and strong performance with existing customers as eastern port volumes increased.Other Other revenue increased $66 million versus prior year primarily due to a $58 million settlement in 2017 related to a customer that did not meet historical volume commitments and higher incidental charges.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 29CSX CORPORATIONPART IIExpenseIn 2017, total expenses increased $61 million, or one percent, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $245 million due to the following items:•Efficiency and volume savings of $274 million were driven primarily by reductions in overall headcount and other effects of implementing scheduled railroading as well as the impacts of the 2017 restructuring initiative, slightly offset by higher volume-related costs. •Pension costs decreased $66 million primarily due to adoption in 2017 of the spot rate approach for measuring service and interest costs, prior year contributions and other favorable plan experience.•The extra fiscal week in 2016 resulted in $51 million of additional cost compared to 2017.•Inflation resulted in $152 million of additional cost driven by increased health and welfare costs and wage increases.•Various other costs decreased $6 million.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and coal pier services and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expenses increased $21 million driven by the following:•Real estate gains were $14 million in 2017 compared to $115 million in 2016 related to the sale of an operating property and other related income. (See additional discussion of real estate gains in the Equity Earnings of Affiliates section below.)•Inflation resulted in $37 million of additional cost.•Asset impairments of $25 million resulted from the discontinuation of certain in-progress projects as a result of transition to scheduled railroading. •Relocation costs increased $19 million, which includes the impact of the Company’s initiative to consolidate dispatchers. •Additional expense of $13 million resulted from train accidents during the year.•Efficiency and volume savings of $152 million are primarily related to lower maintenance costs from the reduction in the active locomotive fleet, lower operating support costs and a reduction in contingent workers.•Favorable judgments resulted in compensation to CSX for previously condemned properties, reflecting gains of $73 million.•The extra week in 2016 resulted in $18 million of additional cost compared to 2017.•Other costs increased $69 million due to various non-significant items.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $14 million due to a larger asset base, partially offset by $25 million of additional costs in 2016 from the extra week compared to 2017. CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 30CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $151 million driven by the following:•A 24 percent increase in the average fuel price per gallon, from $1.48 to $1.84 per gallon versus the prior year, drove $154 million in increased fuel expense.•The extra week in 2016 resulted in $15 million of additional cost compared to 2017.•Other costs increased $12 million primarily due to increased fuel expense for non-locomotive fuel, partially offset by efficiency and volume savings.Equipment and Other expenses include rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses decreased $36 million driven by the following:•The extra week in 2016 resulted in $7 million of additional cost compared to 2017.•Other costs decreased $29 million primarily due to the reclassification of rental income from other non-operating to operating income in 2017, partially offset by inflation.Restructuring Charge of $325 million includes costs related to restructuring activities in 2017, including the management workforce reduction, executive retirements, reimbursement arrangements, the proration of equity awards and other advisory costs related to the leadership transition.Equity Earnings of Affiliates includes earnings from operating equity method investments. Equity earnings of affiliates increased $169 million primarily due to the following:•Tax reform resulted in a $142 million increase in earnings (primarily related to TTX and Conrail).•Real estate gains of $16 million were recognized on the sale of a property owned by one of the Company's equity affiliates.•Other increases were primarily due to increased equity earnings from affiliates, primarily TTX as a result of higher rental volumes and decreased costs.Interest Expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and capital leases. Interest expense decreased $33 million to $546 million due to lower average interest rates and $11 million of additional expense in 2016 related to the extra week, partially offset by higher average debt balances.Debt Repurchase Expense includes costs associated with the extinguishment of debt. These costs decreased $115 million due to the repurchase of notes in 2016 that did not repeat in the current year.Other Income (Expense) - net includes investment gains and losses, certain non-operating equity earnings or losses and other non-operating activities. Other income decreased $25 million to $21 million primarily due to the reclassification of real estate activities from other non-operating to operating income in 2017.Income Tax Benefit (Expense) decreased $3.4 billion from an expense of $1.0 billion in 2016 to a benefit of $2.3 billion in 2017 primarily due to a $3.5 billion non-cash reduction in income tax mostly resulting from the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the recently enacted 21 percent federal corporate tax rate. This reduction was partially offset by additional income tax expense resulting from increased earnings before income taxes.Net Earnings increased $3.8 billion to $5.5 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $4.18 to $5.99, due to the factors mentioned above, including the significant impact of tax reform. Lower average shares outstanding resulting from higher share repurchase activity had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 31CSX CORPORATIONPART II2016 vs. 2015 Results of Operations(a) Fiscal Years 2016 2015 $ Change % Change (Dollars in Millions) Revenue$11,069 $11,811 $(742) (6)% Expense Labor and Fringe3,159 3,290 131 4 Materials, Supplies and Other2,092 2,356 264 11 Depreciation1,301 1,208 (93) (8) Fuel713 957 244 25 Equipment and Other Rents465 456 (9) (2) Equity Earnings of Affiliates(50) (40) 10 25 Total Expense7,680 8,227 547 7 Operating Income3,389 3,584 (195) (5) Interest Expense(579) (544) (35) (6) Debt Repurchase Expense(115) — (115) — Other Income - Net46 98 (52) (53) Income Tax Expense(1,027) (1,170) 143 12 Net Earnings$1,714 $1,968 $(254) (13) Earnings Per Diluted Share: Net Earnings$1.81 $2.00 $(0.19) (10)% Operating Ratio69.4% 69.7% 30bps(a) Prior to third quarter 2017, CSX followed a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar.

CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 33CSX CORPORATIONPART IIRevenueIn 2016, revenue decreased $742 million, or six percent, due to a five percent decline in volume (including the $178 million positive impact of an extra week of volume) and a significant decline in fuel recoveries, partially offset by increased pricing.MerchandiseChemicals - Volume declined as energy market headwinds significantly reduced crude oil and frac sand shipments. This reduction was partially offset by the ramp up of a fly ash remediation project and a modest increase in core chemical markets.Automotive - Volume increased as a result of strong North American light vehicle production and growth across several customers. Additionally, movement of trucks and SUVs continued to outpace passenger cars, consistent with customer buying patterns.Agricultural and Food Products - Volume declined as the strong U.S. dollar continued to support import grain and a robust Southeastern crop spurred additional local truck sourcing, displacing grain shipments by rail. Additionally, ethanol market dynamics shifted to favor the Gulf region for storage and export, precluding CSX from participation in shipments from Western origins to the Gulf.Minerals - Volume was up slightly due to strong gains in aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel), particularly for highway and non-residential construction in southern markets. The growth was partially offset by headwinds in salt and lime, reflecting mild winter weather and steel production challenges, respectively.Fertilizers - Volume was flat as the strong U.S. dollar, which drove high levels of imported sulfur, displaced rail transport, and nitrogen demand fell in anticipation of further commodity price deterioration. This offset growth in phosphate rock, driven by operational efficiency that allowed for additional rail traffic conversion that would otherwise move by truck.Forest Products - Volume declined as headwinds from electronic substitution and reduced paper products demand drove industry consolidation that reduced rail volume. Further, excess truck capacity in 2016 captured some volume that traditionally moved by rail.Metals and Equipment - Volume was down as the strong U.S. dollar allowed for continued high levels of steel imports, which led to reduced domestic steel production, mill closures and the loss of associated rail moves. These declines were partially offset by strength in the wind-energy and power generation markets.CoalDomestic - Volume declined 23 percent as mild winter weather in the beginning of the year and low natural gas prices reduced utility coal burn rates and resulted in inflated coal stockpiles. Further, the weak domestic integrated steel market drove volume decreases in coke.Export - Volume was down 15 percent in both metallurgical and thermal coal as a result of the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply which impacted U.S. competitiveness in the world market, particularly in the first half of the year.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 34CSX CORPORATIONPART IIIntermodalDomestic - Volume increased 4 percent as secular growth and new service offerings were partially offset by excess truck capacity headwinds and a short-haul competitive loss.International - Volume declined 9 percent as headwinds from competitive losses more than offset moderate growth across other customers. Other Other revenue decreased $110 million versus prior year primarily due to payments received in 2015 from customers that did not meet volume commitments. Further decreases in incidental revenue as well as lower coal revenue from affiliates were partially offset by adjustments to revenue reserves.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 35CSX CORPORATIONPART IIExpenseIn 2016, total expenses decreased $547 million, or seven percent, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Year-over-year changes related to the extra week are estimated incremental expenses of $116 million incurred for the week of December 24 through December 30, 2016. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $131 million due to the following items:•Efficiency savings of $249 million were driven by lower T&E and operating support costs as a result of structural changes, reduced crew training and the Company's train length initiative that began in the second quarter of 2015.•Volume-related costs were $116 million lower.•Incentive compensation was $111 million higher reflecting the expected award payouts on existing plans.•Inflation resulted in $106 million of additional cost driven by increased health and welfare costs.•The extra week resulted in $51 million of additional cost.•Restructuring costs decreased $37 million due to the 2015 workforce reduction initiatives costs that nearly all occurred in 2015.•Various other costs increased $3 million.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and coal pier services and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expenses decreased $264 million driven by the following:•Real estate gains increased $98 million primarily related to a current year gain of $115 million related to the sale of an operating property and other related income partially offset by a prior year real estate gain.•Efficiency savings of $95 million were primarily related to lower operating support costs driven by structural changes and broad cost containment.•Train accident and casualty costs were $70 million lower due to the continuing declines in the severity of train accidents as well as injuries.•Inflation resulted in $34 million of additional costs.•The extra week resulted in $18 million of additional cost.•Volume-related costs were $11 million lower.•Various other costs decreased $42 million.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $93 million due to a larger asset base and the $25 million impact of the extra week in 2016.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 36CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $244 million driven by the following:•Average fuel price per gallon decreased 18 percent, from $1.80 to $1.48 per gallon versus the prior year, which reduced expenses by $137 million.•Efficiency savings of $60 million were primarily related to locomotive fuel reduction technology and process improvement.•Volume-related costs were $58 million lower.•The extra week resulted in $15 million of additional cost.•Various other costs decreased $4 million.Equipment and Other expenses include rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $9 million driven by the following:•Inflation resulted in $18 million of additional cost primarily related to rates on automotive freight cars.•Volume related costs were $14 million higher due primarily to growth in automotive volume.•The extra week resulted in $7 million of additional cost.•Efficiency savings of $23 million were due to improved car cycle times.•Net other costs decreased $7 million.Equity Earnings of Affiliates increased $10 million primarily as a result of higher rental volumes and decreased costs at TTX.Interest Expense increased $35 million to $579 million due to higher average debt balances in addition to $11 million of additional expense related to the extra week in 2016, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Debt Repurchase Expense increased to $115 million due to the repurchase of certain notes that were expected to mature in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Other Income (Expense) - net decreased $52 million to $46 million primarily due to a prior year $59 million gain on a sale of non-operating easements and reimbursement of environmental costs of $21 million related to this sale. This decrease was partially offset by other non-operating items, none of which were individually significant.Income Tax Expense decreased $143 million to $1.0 billion primarily due to lower earnings.Net Earnings decreased $254 million to $1.7 billion, and earnings per diluted share decreased $0.19 to $1.81 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding resulting from higher share repurchase activity had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 37CSX CORPORATIONPART IINon-GAAP Measures - UnauditedCSX reports its financial results in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.Adjusted Operating ResultsManagement believes that adjusted operating income, adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share, assuming dilution are important in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability. These non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude certain significant items that are not considered indicative of future financial trends. The restructuring charge of $325 million was tax effected using rates reflective of the applicable tax amounts for each component of the charge. The $3.6 billion benefit to net earnings resulting from tax reform was comprised of a $3.5 billion (after-tax) reduction to income tax expense and a $142 million (pre-tax) benefit in operating income from equity earnings of affiliates, partially offset by $1 million (pre-tax) of additional expense from minority interests.

Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. Free cash flow before dividends increased $854 million year-over-year to $1.7 billion. The increase in free cash flow from the prior year is primarily due to lower property additions of $358 million, voluntary contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans of $250 million in 2016 and higher earnings from operations. Adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact cash payments of $135 million for restructuring charge. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure). Fiscal Years 2017 2016 2015(Dollars in Millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$3,472 $3,041 $3,370Property additions (2,040) (2,398) (2,562)Other investing activities134 204 184Free Cash Flow (before payment of dividends)$1,566 $847 $992Add back: Cash Payments for Restructuring Charge (after-tax) (a)$135 $— $—Adjusted Free Cash Flow Before Dividends (non-GAAP)$1,701 $847 $992(a) The restructuring charge impact to free cash flow was tax effected using the applicable tax rate of the charge. Through fourth quarter 2017, the Company made cash payments of $187 million related to the restructuring charge. The Company also made $30 million in payments to the former CEO, Michael J. Ward, and President, Clarence E. Gooden, for previously accrued non-qualified pension benefits that are not included in the restructuring charge.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 39CSX CORPORATIONPART IIOperating Statistics (Estimated) Fiscal Years 2017 2016 Improvement/ (Deterioration)Safety FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index1.19 1.05 (13)%FRA Train Accident Rate3.17 2.83 (12) Operations Performance Train Velocity (Miles per hour)(a)15.1 14.9 1Dwell (Hours)(a)11.3 11.4 1 On-Time Originations80% 84% (5)On-Time Arrivals56% 55% 2(a) The methodology for calculating train velocity and dwell differ from that prescribed by the STB.

On-Time Originations - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.On-Time Arrivals - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time.The Company measures and reports safety and service performance. The Company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training, innovation and investment. Investment in training and technology also is designed to allow CSX employees to have an additional layer of protection that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents. The Company's safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.CSX’s FRA reportable personal injury frequency index of 1.19 for the full year of 2017 was 13 percent unfavorable versus the prior year as man-hours fell by nine percent while overall injuries were up slightly. While the FRA train accident frequency rate increased year-over-year, overall FRA train accidents remained flat and train miles decreased 12 percent year-over-year. CSX remains committed to ongoing safety improvement, with a focus on reducing injury severity and avoiding catastrophic events.In order to more accurately represent the Company’s operating performance, CSX revised the way it calculates train velocity and terminal dwell effective third quarter 2017. These revisions are consistent with the principles of scheduled railroading. Updated definitions for each key performance measure are included beneath the Operating Statistics table. Prior periods have been restated to conform to the current methodology. Details of the changes are as follows:•Train velocity has been expanded to include intermediate dwell, now measuring end-to-end transit time. •Dwell has been expanded to include car dwell time at terminals on through trains, now measuring all car dwell time on an end-to-end trip.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 40CSX CORPORATIONPART IIThese revisions differ from the methodology prescribed by the Surface Transportation Board (""STB"") for reporting train velocity and dwell. CSX will continue to report train velocity and dwell to the STB on a weekly basis using the prescribed methodology. At the STB's request, CSX is providing additional operating measures on a weekly basis that are available on the Company's website. CSX’s operating performance improved versus the prior year in certain categories as network fluidity challenges in the third quarter of 2017 were offset by substantial improvement from the implementation of scheduled railroading and a balanced train plan. Going forward, CSX remains focused on executing the operational plan to deliver further service gains, improve transit times and drive asset utilization while controlling costs.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed.Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash FlowsConsolidated Balance SheetsCSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases.Total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $325 million from prior year. The increase in assets was driven by higher net properties of $614 million resulting from capital investment and an increase in affiliates and other companies of $160 million primarily resulting from the benefits of recent tax reform. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash and short-term investments of $601 million. The increase in total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined was driven by net earnings of $5.5 billion, partially offset by the decrease in deferred income taxes of $3.2 billion as a result of recent tax reform and share repurchases of $2.0 billion.Significant Cash FlowsThe following charts present net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2017, 2016 and 2015. CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 41CSX CORPORATIONPART IISources of CashThe Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2017, the Company generated $3.5 billion of cash provided by operating activities which was $431 million higher than prior year primarily driven by $250 million in voluntary contributions in 2016 to the Company's qualified pension plans and higher net earnings, partially offset by payments related to restructuring activities. In 2016, the Company generated $3.0 billion of cash provided by operating activities which was $329 million lower than 2015 primarily driven by $250 million in voluntary contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans. Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2020. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information.Third, CSX filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in February 2016 which is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.Uses of CashCSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion, a decrease of $303 million from the prior year primarily driven by lower property additions. In 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion from 2015 primarily driven by lower net purchases of short-term investments and lower property additions.The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 42CSX CORPORATIONPART IIPlanned capital investments for 2018 are expected to be $1.6 billion, including about $200 million for PTC. Of the 2018 investment, the majority will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. The remaining amounts will be allocated to projects supporting productivity initiatives, service enhancements and profitable growth. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations.The Company expects to continue incurring significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC. CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be approximately $2.4 billion. This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. Total PTC spending through 2017 was $2.0 billion. In addition to capital investments, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases, share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders. In April 2017, the Company announced an 11 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.20 per common share. In 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $2.2 billion, which represents an increase in spending of $911 million from the prior year primarily driven by higher share repurchases and lower net debt issued, partially offset by the repayment of seller-financed assets in the prior year. In 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $1.3 billion, which represents an increase in spending of $749 million from 2015 primarily driven by the repayment of seller-financed assets, higher share repurchases, and lower net debt issued.CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Liquidity and Working CapitalCurrently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $419 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX has a $1 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility expires in May 2020 and as of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. Additionally in 2017, CSX issued a total of $850 million of new long-term debt. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time, repurchases of CSX's common stock, capital investments, working capital requirements and improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements. With the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Act"") on December 22, 2017, the federal corporate income tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Beginning in 2018, CSX expects its effective federal and state income tax rate to be approximately 25%. The Company has a receivables securitization facility with a three-year term scheduled to expire in September 2019. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity of up to $200 million, depending on eligible receivables balances. Under the terms of this facility, CSXT transfers eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX services the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. In the event CSX Trade Receivables draws under this facility, the Company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 43CSX CORPORATIONPART IIWorking capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $21 million at December 2017 and $447 million at December 2016. This decrease since year end is primarily due to shares repurchases of $2.0 billion, cash paid for property additions of $2.0 billion and dividends paid of $708 million. These working capital decreases were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $3.5 billion and new debt issued of $850 million.The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. CSX is currently reviewing its cash deployment strategy with respect to capital structure and shareholder distributions.Credit RatingsCredit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings remained stable during 2017. As of December 2017 and December 2016, S&P's long-term rating on CSX was BBB+ (Stable), and Moody's was Baa1 (Stable). Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. The Company is committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 44CSX CORPORATIONPART IISCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTSThe following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other significant commitments: Type of Obligation20182019202020212022ThereafterTotal(Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations Total Debt (See Note 9)$19$18$745$371$162$10,494$11,809Interest on Debt5505495374984847,95310,571Purchase Obligations (See Note 7)2902292532582582,9294,217Other Post-Employment Benefits (See Note 8) (a)5343413936145357Operating Leases - Net (See Note 7) (b)383420151174192Agreements with Conrail (See Note 12) (b)272727272748183Total Contractual Obligations$977$900$1,623$1,208$978$21,643$27,329 Other Commitments (c)$100$2$2$2$2$—$108(a)Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans which are unfunded. No amounts are included for funded pension obligations as no contributions are currently required.(b)Agreements with Conrail represent minimum future lease payments of $183 million under the shared asset area agreements (see Note 12, Related Party Transactions). These amounts plus total operating leases-net of $192 million above equals total net lease commitments of $375 million disclosed in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.(c)Other commitments of $108 million consisted of surety bonds, letters of credit, uncertain tax positions and public private partnerships. Surety bonds of $43 million and letters of credit of $30 million arise from assurances issued by a third-party that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement. Uncertain tax positions of $24 million, which include interest and penalties, are all included in year 2018 as the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated. Contractual commitments related to public-private partnerships are $11 million.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSFor detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.LABOR AGREEMENTSApproximately 20,000 of the Company's employees are members of a labor union. The U.S. Class I railroads have been in collective bargaining with rail labor unions since January 2015. On October 5, 2017, six rail unions making up the Coordinated Bargaining Group (""CBG"") reached a National Agreement with the railroads, effective January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2019. On January 23, 2018, the Transportation Communications International Union (TCU) and Brotherhood Railway Carmen (BRC) ratified new contract terms with the nation’s major freight railroads. Collectively, to date, approximately 70% of our employees have now ratified the national settlement terms. The Class I railroads will continue to bargain with the remaining 30 percent and expect to reach a settlement with some or all of the remaining unions in 2018.Separately, in December 2014, CSXT reached a local agreement covering wages and work rules through 2019 with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, which represents approximately 20 percent of the union workforce of CSXT.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 45CSX CORPORATIONPART IICRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:•personal injury, environmental and legal reserves;•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and•income taxes. Personal Injury, Environmental and Legal ReservesPersonal InjuryPersonal Injury reserves of $168 million and $170 million for 2017 and 2016, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. As a direct result of improvements in safety in recent years, the Company has experienced a downward trend in the severity of injuries which has resulted in a decrease in the estimate of costs per incident. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves in the consolidated financial statements.EnvironmentalEnvironmental reserves were $90 million and $95 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 214 environmentally impaired sites. The Company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:•type of clean-up required;•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.Conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves in the consolidated financial statements.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 46CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedLegalThe Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan AccountingThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. As of December 2017, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $3.0 billion.In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Eligible retirees who are age 65 years or older (Medicare-eligible) are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Eligible retirees younger than 65 years (non-Medicare eligible) are covered by a self-insured program partially funded by participating retirees. The life insurance plan is non-contributory. As of December 2017, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s other post-retirement benefit plans was $250 million.For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans.The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;•long-term rate of return on plan assets;•salary scale inflation rates; and•other assumptions.The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. These amounts are reviewed by management.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 47CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedDiscount RatesDiscount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.Beginning in 2017, the Company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and post-retirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weighted-average discount rate approach, which was used in prior years. The Company made this change to improve the correlation between projected pension and post-retirement benefit liability cash flows and the corresponding spot discount rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity. The calculated pension and post-retirement benefits liabilities are consistent under both the traditional and spot rate approaches. The Company accounted for this change on a prospective basis as a change in accounting estimate.The weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its 2017 pension and post-retirement obligations are 3.56 percent and 3.34 percent, respectively. For 2016, the weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations were 4.08 percent and 3.71 percent, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2017, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and seven years, respectively. Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.Long-term Rate of Return on Plan AssetsThe expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75 percent in both 2017 and 2016.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 48CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedSalary Scale Inflation RatesSalary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.60 percent in both 2017 and 2016 to value its pension obligations.Other AssumptionsThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.2018 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement ExpenseNet pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense for 2018 are expected to be a $7 million benefit and an $8 million expense, respectively. Net pension costs for 2018 are expected to be a $7 million benefit and include service cost expense of $35 million. Post-retirement benefits costs for 2018 are expected to be an $8 million expense and include service cost expense of $2 million. Service cost expense will be included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement. Net periodic pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense in 2017 was a $2 million benefit and a $9 million expense, respectively. The decrease in expense is primarily due to favorable pension asset experience, slightly offset by the decrease in discount rates.The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a one percent change in certain assumptions like discount rates, long-term rate of return and salaries on the 2018 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:(Dollars in Millions) Pension Expense Post-Retirement ExpenseDiscount Rate $12 $1Long-term Rate of Return $26 N/ASalary Inflation $7 N/ADepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life MethodThe depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 86% of total fixed assets of $44 billion on a gross basis at December 2017. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under capital leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. Land is not depreciated. CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 49CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued Management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;•evaluation of current operations;•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;•previous assessment of the condition of the assets; •management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes that did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion for 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. A one percent change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $12 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. For additional details, including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies, see Note 6, Properties in the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesCSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2015. During 2017, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax years 2016 and 2017. Management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2017, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $24 million.New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting PolicySee Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy.”CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 50CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 2017, CSX does not have a material amount of floating rate debt obligations outstanding, and therefore fluctuations in the interest rate would not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.CSX 2017 Form 10-K p. 53CSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 8.

Risk FactorsThe risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.Legislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business. In addition, statutes imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies and impact service performance. For example, the RSIA, as amended, mandated that the installation of PTC hardware be completed by December 31, 2018 and requires that the PTC system be fully operational by December 31, 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. Although CSX remains on track to meet this regulatory requirement, noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.Network constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency.CSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased volume; (ii) locomotive or crew shortages; (iii) extreme weather conditions; (iv) impacts from changes in yard capacity, or network structure or composition, including train routes; (v) increased passenger activities; or (vi) regulatory changes impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes, which could have a negative effect on CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 7CSX CORPORATIONPART IGlobal economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, if the rate of economic growth in Asia slows, European economies contract, or if the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal changes from its current levels, U.S. export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for CSX. Additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Increases in production and source locations of natural gas in the U.S. have resulted in lower natural gas prices in CSX’s service territory. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Additionally, crude oil prices combined with increased pipeline activity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production, which has affected crude oil volumes for CSX.The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. Such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages. A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect. Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 8CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination.Disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.The capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.The Company faces competition from other transportation providers.The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 9CSX CORPORATIONPART IFuture acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.The Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 10CSX CORPORATIONPART IFailure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 70 percent of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into CSX-specific, or “local”, bargaining agreements which could also be critical to the Company.The unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and conductors, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period. Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.The Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNoneCSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 11CSX CORPORATIONPART IItem 2. Properties The Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.Track and InfrastructureServing 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern markets of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.CSXT’s track structure includes mainline track, connecting terminals and yards, track within terminals and switching yards, sidings used for passing trains, track connecting CSXT's track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads, are greater than CSXT’s approximately 20,500 route miles. At December 2018, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track MilesMainline track26,286Terminals and switching yards9,350Passing sidings and turnouts921Total36,557In addition to its physical track structure, the Company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service. These serve as points of connectivity between the Company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers are received, classed for destination and placed onto outbound trains, or arrive and are delivered to the customer. As part of the transition to scheduled railroading, CSX converted a number of hump yards to flat switching operations which allows for less intermediate processing and the opportunity to improve transit time. The Company’s largest yards and terminals based on 2018 volume (number of railcars or intermodal containers processed) are listed below.Yards and TerminalsBedford Park Intermodal Terminal - Chicago, IL Waycross, GASelkirk, NYAvon, IN (Indianapolis)Cincinnati, OHNashville, TNLouisville, KYWalbridge, OH (Toledo)Rocky Mount, NCChicago, ILCSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 12CSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork GeographyCSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These engineering attributes permit the corridor to support high-speed service across intermodal, automotive and merchandise commodities. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, coal and intermodal.Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia, and provides access to major eastern ports.Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Southeast, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. The domestic coal market has declined significantly over the past several years and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility. CSXT’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Roughly one-third of the tons of export coal and the majority of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity.See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network. Also included on the map, CSX Operating Agreement indicates areas within which CSX can operate through trackage rights beyond the CSX network.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 13CSX CORPORATIONPART ICSX Rail NetworkCSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 14CSX CORPORATIONPART ILocomotivesAt December 2018, CSXT owned nearly 3,900 locomotives. From time to time, the Company also short-term leases locomotives based on business needs. Freight locomotives are used primarily to pull trains while switching locomotives are used in yards. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain.

Examples of these include railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service), multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared between railroads) and double-stack railcars, or well cars (which are industry pooled), that allow for two intermodal containers to be loaded one above the other.At December 2018, the Company’s owned and long-term leased equipment consisted of the following:EquipmentNumber of Units %Gondolas19,388 36%Multi-level flat cars11,476 22%Covered hoppers8,570 16%Open-top hoppers8,273 16%Box cars4,873 9%Flat cars533 1%Other cars266 —%Subtotal freight cars53,379 100%Containers18,051 Total equipment71,430 CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 15CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company’s revenue-generating equipment, either owned or long-term leased, consists of freight cars and containers as described below. Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles.Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and industrial sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers.Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions.Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine.Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.Other cars – Primarily leased refrigerator cars and slab steel cars.Containers – Weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight.Item 3.

CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 20CSX CORPORATIONPART IICSX Purchases of Equity SecuritiesCSX purchases its own shares for two primary reasons: (1) to further its goals under its share repurchase programs and (2) to fund the Company’s contribution required to be paid in CSX common stock under a 401(k) plan that covers certain union employees.In February 2018, the Company announced an increase to the $1.5 billion share repurchase program first announced in October 2017, bringing the total authorized to $5 billion. This program was completed on January 16, 2019. Also on January 16, 2019, the Company announced a new $5 billion share repurchase program. The repurchases may be made through a variety of methods including, but not limited to, open market purchases, purchases pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, accelerated share repurchases and negotiated block purchases. The timing of share repurchases depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.During 2018, 2017, and 2016, CSX repurchased the following shares: Fiscal Years 2018 2017 2016Shares Repurchased (Units in Millions)72 39 38Cost of Shares (Dollars in Millions)$4,671 $1,970 $1,056Average Price Paid per Share$64.64 $50.80 $27.52During 2018, the Company entered into four accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. Under these agreements, the Company paid $1.5 billion and received approximately 22 million total shares, which are included in the table above.Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guide the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances. Shares are retired immediately upon repurchase. In accordance with the Equity Topic in the Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC""), the excess of repurchase price over par value is recorded in retained earnings. Generally, retained earnings are only otherwise impacted by net earnings and dividends.

Domestic coke, iron ore and other volume increased primarily driven by stronger domestic steel production. Export volume increased as global supply levels and elevated global benchmark prices supported continued demand for U.S. coal.IntermodalDomestic volume was relatively flat as rationalization of low-density lanes was mostly offset by growth with existing customers due to tight truck conditions. International volume increased driven by new customers and strong performance with existing customers, which more than offset losses from the rationalization of low-density lanes.Other Other revenue increased $148 million versus prior year primarily due to increases in incidental charges, partially offset by settlements in 2017 from customers who did not meet historical volume commitments.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 27CSX CORPORATIONPART IIExpenseIn 2018, total expenses decreased $307 million, or 4%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $208 million due to the following items:•Costs decreased $198 million driven by lower headcount and crew starts, partially offset by higher inflation and volume.•Incentive compensation increased $26 million due to higher projected payouts.•Other costs decreased $36 million due to the recognition of railroad retirement tax refunds related to past share-based compensation awards and several other items, none of which were individually significant.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items including gains on property dispositions. Total materials, supplies and other expenses decreased $146 million driven by the following:•Gains from line and real estate sales were $136 million higher in 2018.•Costs decreased $49 million as a result of lower operating support costs, partially offset by inflation.•Favorable judgments related to previously condemned properties resulted in prior year gains of $73 million.•Other costs decreased $34 million primarily driven by a reduction in personal injury expense resulting from a decline the severity of injuries and other items, none of which were individually significant.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $16 million due to a larger asset base.Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $182 million primarily due to a 24 percent price increase that drove additional expense of $200 million, partially offset by fuel efficiency initiatives.Equipment and Other expenses include rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses decreased $34 million primarily due to reduced days per load, particularly for merchandise and automotive markets, partially offset by volume-related costs.Equity Earnings of Affiliates includes earnings from operating equity method investments. Equity earnings of affiliates decreased $123 million primarily due to a $142 million favorable impact of tax reform (primarily related to TTX and Conrail) and a real estate gain of $16 million for the sale of a property owned by one of the Company's equity affiliates both included in prior year results. These decreases were partially offset by higher affiliate earnings in the current year.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 28CSX CORPORATIONPART IIInterest ExpenseInterest Expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and capital leases. Interest expense increased $93 million to $639 million primarily due to higher average debt balances partially offset by lower average interest rates.Other Income - NetOther Income - Net includes investment gains, losses and interest income, as well as components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. Other income increased $21 million to $74 million primarily due to increased interest income as a result of higher average investment balances.Income Tax ExpenseIncome Tax Expense increased $3.3 billion from a benefit of $2.3 billion in 2017 to an expense of $1.0 billion in 2018 due to a $3.5 billion non-cash reduction in income tax in 2017 primarily due to the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent as part of tax reform. This increase was also due to additional income tax expense resulting from increased earnings before income taxes, partially offset by a lower enacted income tax rate.Net EarningsNet Earnings decreased $2.2 billion to $3.3 billion, and earnings per diluted share decreased $2.15 to $3.84, due to the factors mentioned above, including the significant impact of tax reform on 2017 results. Lower average shares outstanding resulting from higher share repurchase activity had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 29CSX CORPORATIONPART II2017 vs. 2016 Results of Operations(a) Fiscal Years 2017 2016 $ Change % Change (Dollars in Millions) Revenue$11,408 $11,069 $339 3 % Expense Labor and Fringe2,946 3,135 189 6 Materials, Supplies and Other2,113 2,092 (21) (1) Depreciation1,315 1,301 (14) (1) Fuel864 713 (151) (21) Equipment and Other Rents429 465 36 8 Restructuring Charge240 — (240) (100) Equity Earnings of Affiliates(219) (50) 169 338 Total Expense7,688 7,656 (32) — Operating Income3,720 3,413 307 9 Interest Expense(546) (579) 33 6 Debt Repurchase Expense— (115) 115 100 Restructuring Charge - Non-Operating(85) — (85) (100) Other Income - Net53 22 31 141 Income Tax Benefit (Expense)2,329 (1,027) 3,356 327 Net Earnings$5,471 $1,714 $3,757 219 Earnings Per Diluted Share: Net Earnings$5.99 $1.81 $4.18 231 % Operating Ratio67.4% 69.2% 180bps(a) Prior to third quarter 2017, CSX followed a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar.

CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 31CSX CORPORATIONPART IIRevenueIn 2017, revenue increased $339 million when compared to the previous year, primarily due to gains in export coal, price increases across nearly all other markets and fuel recovery, partially offset by the $178 million impact of an extra fiscal week in 2016 and lower merchandise volumes. Revenue per unit increased over prior year as pricing gains and higher fuel recoveries were partially offset by unfavorable mix.MerchandiseChemicals - Volume declined, primarily due to sustained challenges in the Eastern crude-by-rail market. This decline offset an increase in shipments of frac sand and petroleum gases due to growth in drilling activity.Automotive - Volume declined as North American vehicle production fell.Agricultural and Food Products - Volume declined due to challenges in the export market as well as a large southeastern grain crop leading to local truck sourcing to feed mills.Minerals - Volume slightly declined as short-term competitive losses were mostly offset by growth in construction project activity.Fertilizers - Volume declined, primarily driven by the closure of a customer facility as well as Hurricane Irma’s impact on Central Florida phosphate operations.Forest Products - Volume declined as the decrease in shipments of paper products as a result of mill closures and truck competition was partially offset by strong pulp board volumes driven by e- commerce demand.Metals and Equipment - Volume slightly declined as a nonrecurring 2016 benefit from large pipe projects was partially offset by increases in equipment moves.CoalDomestic utility coal volume declined 12 percent as the competitive loss of short-haul interchange traffic more than offset underlying growth at other utilities. Domestic coke, iron ore and other volume declined 13 percent, primarily in iron ore shipments, as a large customer temporarily halted its production. Export volume increased 42 percent as global supply levels and pricing conditions supported strong growth in U.S. coal exports.IntermodalDomestic volume declined 2 percent as rationalization of low-density lanes and competitive losses more than offset growth with existing customers. International volume was up 7 percent driven by competitive gains and strong performance with existing customers as eastern port volumes increased.Other Other revenue increased $66 million versus prior year primarily due to a $58 million settlement in2017 related to a customer that did not meet historical volume commitments and higher incidental charges.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 32CSX CORPORATIONPART IIExpenseIn 2017, total expenses increased $32 million, or less than one percent, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $189 million due to the following items:•Efficiency and volume savings of $274 million were driven primarily by reductions in overall headcount and other effects of implementing scheduled railroading as well as the impacts of the 2017 restructuring initiative, slightly offset by higher volume-related costs.•Pension costs decreased $10 million primarily due to adoption in 2017 of the spot rate approach for measuring service cost.•The extra fiscal week in 2016 resulted in $51 million of additional cost compared to 2017.•Inflation resulted in $152 million of additional cost driven by increased health and welfare costs and wage increases.•Various other costs decreased $6 million.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and coal pier services and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expenses increased $21 million driven by the following:•Real estate gains were $18 million in 2017 compared to $128 million in 2016 related to the sale of an operating property and other related income.•Inflation resulted in $37 million of additional cost.•Asset impairments of $25 million resulted from the discontinuation of certain in-progress projects as a result of transition to scheduled railroading.•Relocation costs increased $19 million, which includes the impact of the Company’s initiative to consolidate dispatchers.•Additional expense of $13 million resulted from train accidents during the year.•Efficiency and volume savings of $152 million are primarily related to lower maintenance costs from the reduction in the active locomotive fleet, lower operating support costs and a reduction in contingent workers.•Favorable judgments resulted in compensation to CSX for previously condemned properties, reflecting gains of $73 million.•The extra week in 2016 resulted in $18 million of additional cost compared to 2017.•Other costs increased $60 million due to various non-significant items.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $14 million due to a larger asset base, partially offset by $25 million of additional costs in 2016 from the extra week compared to 2017.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 33CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $151 million driven by the following:•A 24 percent increase in the average fuel price per gallon, from $1.48 to $1.84 per gallon versus the prior year, drove $154 million in increased fuel expense.•The extra week in 2016 resulted in $15 million of additional cost compared to 2017.•Other costs increased $12 million primarily due to increased fuel expense for non-locomotive fuel, partially offset by efficiency and volume savings.Equipment and Other expenses include rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses decreased $36 million driven by the following:•The extra week in 2016 resulted in $7 million of additional cost compared to 2017.•Other costs decreased $29 million primarily due to the reclassification of rental income from other non-operating to operating income in 2017, partially offset by inflation.Restructuring Charge of $240 million includes costs related to restructuring activities in 2017, including the management workforce reduction, executive retirements, reimbursement arrangements, the proration of equity awards and other advisory costs related to the leadership transition.Equity Earnings of Affiliates includes earnings from operating equity method investments. Equity earnings of affiliates increased $169 million primarily due to the following:•Tax reform resulted in a $142 million increase in earnings (primarily related to TTX and Conrail).•Real estate gains of $16 million were recognized on the sale of a property owned by one of the Company's equity affiliates.•Other increases were primarily due to increased equity earnings from affiliates, primarily TTX as a result of higher rental volumes and decreased costs.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 34CSX CORPORATIONPART IIInterest ExpenseInterest Expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and capital leases. Interest expense decreased $33 million to $546 million due to lower average interest rates and $11 million of additional expense in 2016 related to the extra week, partially offset by higher average debt balances.Restructuring Charge - Non OperatingRestructuring Charge - Non Operating of $85 million includes non-operating costs related to restructuring activities in 2017, including certain pension benefits and other post-retirement benefits curtailment.Other Income - NetOther Income - Net increased $31 million to $53 million primarily due to adoption in 2017 of the spot rate approach for measuring employee benefit plan interest costs, prior year pension contributions and other favorable benefit plan experience, offset by the reclassification of real estate activities from other non-operating to operating income in 2017.Income Tax Benefit (Expense) Income Tax Benefit (Expense) decreased $3.4 billion from an expense of $1.0 billion in 2016 to a benefit of $2.3 billion in 2017 primarily due to a $3.5 billion non-cash reduction in income tax mostly resulting from the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent as part of tax reform. This reduction was partially offset by additional income tax expense resulting from increased earnings before income taxes. Net EarningsNet Earnings increased $3.8 billion to $5.5 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $4.18 to $5.99, due to the factors mentioned above, including the significant impact of tax reform. Lower average shares outstanding resulting from higher share repurchase activity had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 35CSX CORPORATIONPART IINon-GAAP Measures - UnauditedCSX reports its financial results in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.Prior Year Adjusted Operating ResultsManagement believes that adjusted operating income, adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share, assuming dilution are important in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability. These non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude certain significant items that are not considered indicative of future financial trends. The impact of tax reform, the restructuring charge and retrospective impact of adoption of a new accounting standard update on 2017 operating results are shown in the following table. There were no adjustments to operating results in 2018. As noted in Note 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, the Company adopted the provisions of an accounting standard related to the presentation of net pension and other post-retirement benefit costs during the first quarter 2018 and applied them retrospectively. For the Year ended December 31, 2017(in millions, except operating ratio and net earnings per share, assuming dilution) Operating Income Operating Ratio Net Earnings Net Earnings Per Share, Assuming DilutionAs Previously Reported - GAAP $3,667 67.9 % $5,471 $5.99Reclassification of Net Pension and Other Post-Retirement Expense 53 (0.5) — —As Reclassified - GAAP 3,720 67.4 5,471 5.99Restructuring Charge (a)(b) 240 (2.1) 203 0.22Tax Reform Benefit (net) (142) 1.2 (3,577) (3.91)Adjusted Operating Results (non-GAAP) $3,818 66.5 % $2,097 $2.30(a) The restructuring charge was tax effected using rates reflective of the applicable tax amounts for each component of the restructuring charge. (b) For 2017, $85 million of the $325 million restructuring charge was reclassified to non-operating income (expense)as a result of the adoption of an accounting standard update related to the presentation of net pension and other post-retirement benefit costs. CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 36CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFree Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash FlowManagement believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities, which includes proceeds from property dispositions. The increase in free cash flow from the prior year of $1.6 billion is primarily due to higher earnings from operations which includes the impact of a lower income tax rate, a decrease in property additions of $295 million and higher proceeds from property dispositions of $222 million.Adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of cash payments for restructuring charge. Adjusted free cash flow before dividends increased $1.5 billion year-over-year to $3.2 billion due to higher earnings from operations which includes the impact of a lower income tax rate, a decrease in property additions of $295 million and higher proceeds from property dispositions of $222 million, partially offset by $124 million lower cash payments for restructuring charge. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (both non-GAAP measures). Fiscal Years 2018 2017 2016(Dollars in Millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$4,641 $3,472 $3,041Property additions (1,745) (2,040) (2,398)Other investing activities292 134 204Free Cash Flow, before dividends (non-GAAP)$3,188 $1,566 $847Add back: Cash Payments for Restructuring Charge (after-tax) (a)$11 $135 $—Adjusted Free Cash Flow, before dividends (non-GAAP)$3,199 $1,701 $847(a) The restructuring charge impact to free cash flow was tax effected using the applicable tax rate of the charge. During 2018 and 2017, the Company made cash payments of $15 million and $187 million, respectively, related to the restructuring charge. Also in 2017, the Company made $30 million in payments to a former CEO and a former President for previously accrued non-qualified pension benefits that are not included in the restructuring charge.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 37CSX CORPORATIONPART IIOperating Statistics (Estimated) Fiscal Years 2018 2017 Improvement/ (Deterioration)Operations Performance Train Velocity (Miles per hour)(a)17.9 15.1 19 %Dwell (Hours)(a)9.6 11.3 15 % Revenue Ton- Miles (Billions) Merchandise128.1 124.0 3 %Coal45.5 43.3 5 %Intermodal29.3 28.8 2 %Total Revenue Ton-Miles202.9 196.1 3 % Total Gross Ton-Miles (Billions)402.7 400.1 1 %On-Time Originations82% 80% 3 %On-Time Arrivals60% 56% 7 % Safety FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index0.99 1.22 19 %FRA Train Accident Rate3.45 3.07 (12)%(a) The methodology for calculating train velocity and dwell differ from that prescribed by the STB. CSXT will continue to report train velocity and dwell, using the prescribed methodology, to the STB on a weekly basis. See additional discussion on the Company's website.Certain operating statistics are estimated and can continue to be updated as actuals settle.Key Performance Measures DefinitionsTrain Velocity - Average train speed between origin and destination in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains). Train velocity measures the profiled schedule of trains (from departure to arrival and all interim time), and train profiles are periodically updated to align with a changing operation.Dwell - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard.Revenue Ton-Miles (RTM's) - The movement of one revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile.Gross Ton-Miles (GTM's) - The movement of one ton of train weight over one mile. GTM's are calculated by multiplying total train weight by distance the train moved. Total train weight is comprised of the weight of the freight cars and their contents. On-Time Originations - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.On-Time Arrivals - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time. FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours. FRA Train Accident Rate - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.The Company strives for continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. Investment in training and technology also is designed to allow the Company's employees to have an additional layer of protection that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents. Safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.The Company’s FRA reportable personal injury frequency index of 0.99 for the full year of 2018 improved 19% versus the prior year as overall injuries fell by 27%, outpacing a reduction in man-hours. The Company’s FRA train accident frequency rate of 3.45 for the full year was 12% unfavorable versus the prior year. Safety performance improved in the second half reflecting the changes made in safety leadership, engagement with external resources and the Company’s renewed focus on enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers and communities in which the company operates. Operating performance improved significantly throughout the year as train velocity and car dwell achieved record levels in 2018. The operational plan remains focused on delivering further service gains, improving transit times and driving asset utilization while controlling costs.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 38CSX CORPORATIONPART IILIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its sources and uses of cash, balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed.Significant Cash FlowsThe following charts highlight the components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2018, 2017 and 2016. In 2018, the Company generated $4.6 billion of cash provided by operating activities which was $1.2 billion higher than prior year primarily driven by higher cash-generating income which includes the impact of a lower income tax rate, partially offset by lower working capital and other activities. In 2017, the Company generated $3.5 billion of cash provided by operating activities which was $431 million higher than 2016 primarily driven by $250 million in voluntary contributions in 2016 to the Company's qualified pension plans and higher net earnings in 2017, partially offset by payments related to restructuring activities.In 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 billion, an increase of $189 million from the prior year primarily driven by an increase in net investment purchases, partially offset by lower property additions and higher proceeds from property dispositions. In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion, a decrease of $303 million from 2016 primarily driven by lower property additions.In 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $2.5 billion, which represents an increase of $321 million from the prior year primarily driven by higher share repurchases, partially offset by higher net debt issued. In 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $2.2 billion, which represented an increase in spending of $911 million from 2016 primarily driven by higher share repurchases and lower net debt issued, partially offset by the repayment of seller-financed assets in the prior year.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 39CSX CORPORATIONPART IISources of Cash and LiquidityThe Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in February 2016 which is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. In 2018, CSX issued a total of $3.0 billion of new long-term debt. CSX has access to a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in May 2020. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. The Company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. At December 31, 2018, the Company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.Uses of CashCSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital requirements, repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time, repurchases of CSX's common stock, capital investments, improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives. In 2018, CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

Of the 2019 investment, over half will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. The remaining amounts will be allocated to projects supporting service enhancements, productivity initiatives and profitable growth. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 40CSX CORPORATIONPART IIThe Company expects to continue incurring capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC. CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be approximately $2.4 billion. This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. Total PTC spending through 2018 was $2.2 billion. CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). The Company also uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases, share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders. In February 2018, the Company announced a 10 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.22 per common share. Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working CapitalCSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases. Further, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $1.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $990 million from prior year. The increase in assets was primarily due to the net increase in cash and short-term investments of $692 million and higher net properties of $234 million. The increase in cash and short-term investments was primarily a result of net cash from operations of $4.6 billion and the issuance of $3.0 billion in long-term debt, partially offset by share repurchases of $4.7 billion and property additions of $1.7 billion. The increase in total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined was driven by the issuance of $3.0 billion in long-term debt and net earnings of $3.3 billion, partially offset by share repurchases of $4.7 billion and dividends paid of $751 million.Working capital is considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $650 million at December 2018 and $21 million at December 2017. This increase since the prior year end is primarily the result of an increase in cash due to net cash from operations of $4.6 billion and the issuance of $3.0 billion in long-term debt. These increases were partially offset by cash used for share repurchases of $4.7 billion, property additions of $1.7 billion and dividend payments of $751 million.The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 41CSX CORPORATIONPART IICredit RatingsCredit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings remained stable during 2018. As of December 2018 and December 2017, S&P's long-term rating on CSX was BBB+ (Stable), and Moody's was Baa1 (Stable). Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.CSX is committed to returning cash to shareholders and maintaining an investment grade credit profile. Capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors.SCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTSThe following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other significant commitments: Type of Obligation20192020202120222023ThereafterTotal(Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations Total Debt (See Note 9)$18$745$371$192$639$12,792$14,757Interest on Debt67566662761359910,09313,273Purchase Obligations (See Note 7)2422802722752692,6994,037Other Post-Employment Benefits (See Note 8) (a)5029272524103258Operating Leases - Net (See Note 7)55565046401,3091,556Agreements with Conrail (b)272727272720155Total Contractual Obligations$1,067$1,803$1,374$1,178$1,598$27,016$34,036 Other Commitments (c)$84$2$2$2$—$—$90(a) Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans which are unfunded.

(c) Other commitments of $90 million consisted of surety bonds, letters of credit, uncertain tax positions and public private partnerships. Surety bonds of $42 million and letters of credit of $28 million arise from assurances issued by a third-party that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement. Uncertain tax positions of $12 million, which include interest and penalties, are all included in year 2018 as the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated. Contractual commitments related to public-private partnerships are $8 million.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 42CSX CORPORATIONPART IIOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSFor detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.LABOR AGREEMENTSApproximately 18,500 of the Company's approximately 22,500 employees are members of a labor union. All 13 rail unions that participate in national bargaining have reached national agreements with the Class I railroads via ratification, executive action or interest arbitration. These agreements are effective January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2019.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:•personal injury, environmental and legal reserves;•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and•income taxes. Personal Injury, Environmental and Legal ReservesPersonal InjuryPersonal Injury reserves of $143 million and $168 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves in the consolidated financial statements.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 43CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedEnvironmentalEnvironmental reserves were $80 million and $90 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 220 environmentally impaired sites. The Company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:•type of clean-up required;•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.Conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves in the consolidated financial statements.LegalThe Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan AccountingThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. As of December 2018, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $2.8 billion.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 44CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedIn addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a non-contributory life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Beginning in 2019, both the life insurance benefit for eligible active employees and health savings account contributions made by the Company to eligible retirees younger than 65 will be eliminated. Beginning in 2020, the employer-funded health reimbursement arrangements for eligible retirees 65 years or older will be eliminated. As a result of these plan amendments, the Company recognized a decrease of $102 million in the post-retirement benefit liability. As of December 2018, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s other post-retirement benefit plans was $118 million.For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans.The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;•long-term rate of return on plan assets;•salary scale inflation rates; and•other assumptions.The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. These amounts are reviewed by management.Discount RatesDiscount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.The Company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and post-retirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weighted-average discount rate approach, which was used prior to 2017. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity. CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 45CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedThe weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its 2018 pension and post-retirement obligations are 4.24 percent and 3.98 percent, respectively. For 2017, the weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations were 3.56 percent and 3.34 percent, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2018, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 11 years and 6 years, respectively. Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.Long-term Rate of Return on Plan AssetsThe expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75 percent in both 2018 and 2017.Salary Scale Inflation RatesSalary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.60 percent in both 2018 and 2017 to value its pension obligations.Other AssumptionsThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 46CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued2019 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement ExpenseNet periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2019 are expected to be a credit of $7 million and $2 million, respectively. Net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2019 are expected to include service cost expense of $32 million and $1 million, respectively. Service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense are included in other income - net. Net periodic pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense in 2018 was an $11 million credit and a $7 million expense, respectively. The net increase in the expected credit is primarily due to changes to the post-retirement benefits plan partially offset by unfavorable pension plan asset experience.The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a one percent change in certain assumptions like discount rates, long-term rate of return and salaries on the 2019 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:(Dollars in Millions) Pension Expense Post-Retirement ExpenseDiscount Rate $13 $1Long-term Rate of Return $26 N/ASalary Inflation $6 N/ADepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life MethodThe depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 87% of total fixed assets of $45 billion on a gross basis at December 2018. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under capital leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. Land is not depreciated. Management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;•evaluation of current operations;•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;•previous assessment of the condition of the assets; •management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 47CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes that did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $1.3 billion for each 2018, 2017 and 2016. A one percent change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $12 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. For additional details, including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies, see Note 6, Properties in the consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesCSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2016. During 2018, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax years 2017 and 2018. Management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2018, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $12 million.New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting PolicySee Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy.”CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 48CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements. The Company intends for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act may contain, among others, statements regarding: •projections and estimates of earnings, revenues, margins, volumes, rates, cost-savings, expenses, taxes or other financial items;•expectations as to results of operations and operational initiatives;•expectations as to the effect of claims, lawsuits, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, labor negotiations or agreements on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity;•management's plans, strategies and objectives for future operations, capital expenditures, workforce levels, dividends, share repurchases, safety and service performance, proposed new services and other matters that are not historical facts, and management's expectations as to future performance and operations and the time by which objectives will be achieved; and•future economic, industry or market conditions or performance and their effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as ""will,"" ""should,"" “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate,” “preliminary” and similar expressions. The Company cautions against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect its good faith beliefs with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to it as of the date the forward-looking statement is made. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the timing when, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual performance or results could differ materially from those anticipated by any forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. If the Company does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be drawn that the Company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements. CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 49CSX CORPORATIONPART IIThe following important factors, in addition to those discussed in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements: •legislative, regulatory or legal developments involving transportation, including rail or intermodal transportation, the environment, hazardous materials, taxation, international trade and initiatives to further regulate the rail industry;•the outcome of litigation, claims and other contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge, environmental matters, taxes, shipper and rate claims subject to adjudication, personal injuries and occupational illnesses;•changes in domestic or international economic, political or business conditions, including those affecting the transportation industry (such as the impact of industry competition, conditions, performance and consolidation) and the level of demand for products carried by CSXT;•natural events such as severe weather conditions, including floods, fire, hurricanes and earthquakes, a pandemic crisis affecting the health of the Company's employees, its shippers or the consumers of goods, or other unforeseen disruptions of the Company's operations, systems, property, equipment or supply chain;•competition from other modes of freight transportation, such as trucking, and competition and consolidation or financial distress within the transportation industry generally; •the cost of compliance with laws and regulations that differ from expectations (including those associated with PTC implementation) as well as costs, penalties and operational and liquidity impacts associated with noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations;•the impact of increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas, including potential effects of high speed rail initiatives, or regulatory changes affecting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes;•unanticipated conditions in the financial markets that may affect timely access to capital markets and the cost of capital, as well as management's decisions regarding share repurchases; •changes in fuel prices, surcharges for fuel and the availability of fuel;•the impact of natural gas prices on coal-fired electricity generation;•the impact of global supply and price of seaborne coal on CSX's export coal market;•availability of insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or insufficient insurance coverage to cover claims or damages;•the inherent business risks associated with safety and security, including the transportation of hazardous materials or a cybersecurity attack which would threaten the availability and vulnerability of information technology;•adverse economic or operational effects from actual or threatened war or terrorist activities and any governmental response;CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 50CSX CORPORATIONPART II•loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees;•labor and benefit costs and labor difficulties, including stoppages affecting either the Company's operations or customers' ability to deliver goods to the Company for shipment;•the Company's success in implementing its strategic, financial and operational initiatives; •the impact of conditions in the real estate market on the Company's ability to sell assets;•changes in operating conditions and costs or commodity concentrations; and•the inherent uncertainty associated with projecting economic and business conditions.Other important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified elsewhere in this report and in CSX's other SEC reports, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Company's website at www.csx.com. The information on the CSX website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 2018, CSX does not have a material amount of floating rate debt obligations outstanding, and therefore fluctuations in the interest rate would not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Changes in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt. The potential decrease in fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates, or approximately 25 basis points, is estimated to be $472 million as of December 31, 2018 and $403 million as of December 31, 2017. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.CSX 2018 Form 10-K p. 51CSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 8.

Risk FactorsThe risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.Legislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business. In addition, statutes or regulations imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs, adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. For example, the RSIA, as amended, mandated that the installation of PTC hardware be completed by December 31, 2018, and requires that the PTC system be fully operational by December 31, 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. Although CSX remains on track to meet this regulatory requirement, noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 7CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers.The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.Global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, slower rates of economic growth in Asia, contraction of European economies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on U.S. export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for CSX. Additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Increases in production and source locations of natural gas in the U.S. have resulted in lower natural gas prices in CSX’s service territory. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Additionally, crude oil prices combined with increased pipeline activity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production, which has affected crude oil volumes for CSX.The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. Such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages. A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect. CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 8CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company’s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change.There is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the Company's operational territory, which could impact the Company's network or other assets. Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination.The Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 9CSX CORPORATIONPART IDisruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.The capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.Network constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency.CSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased volume; (ii) locomotive or crew shortages; (iii) extreme weather conditions; (iv) impacts from changes in yard capacity, or network structure or composition, including train routes; (v) increased passenger activities; or (vi) regulatory changes impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes, which could impact CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available. Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 10CSX CORPORATIONPART IFailure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are either bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee or locally between CSX and the union. Such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. The unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and conductors, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company believes that it has adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period. Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.The Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNoneCSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 11CSX CORPORATIONPART IItem 2. Properties The Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.Track and InfrastructureServing 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern markets of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.CSXT’s track structure includes mainline track, connecting terminals and yards, track within terminals and switching yards, sidings used for passing trains, track connecting CSXT's track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads, are greater than CSXT’s approximately 20,000 route miles. At December 2019, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track MilesMainline track25,793Terminals and switching yards9,316Passing sidings and turnouts921Total36,030In addition to its physical track structure, the Company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service. These serve as points of connectivity between the Company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers are received, classed for destination and placed onto outbound trains, or arrive and are delivered to the customer. The Company’s largest yards and terminals based on 2019 volume (number of railcars or intermodal containers processed) are listed below.Yards and TerminalsAnnual VolumeWaycross, GA874,474Bedford Park Intermodal Terminal - Chicago, IL820,362Nashville, TN648,311Selkirk, NY642,869Avon, IN (Indianapolis)609,468Cincinnati, OH567,582Louisville, KY397,246Fairburn, GA Intermodal Terminal377,736Walbridge, OH (Toledo)323,672Chicago, IL308,653CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 12CSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork GeographyCSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These engineering attributes permit the corridor to support high-speed service across intermodal, automotive and merchandise commodities. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, coal and intermodal.Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia, and provides access to major eastern ports.Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Southeast, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. The domestic coal market has declined significantly over the last decade and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility. CSXT’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Roughly one-third of the tons of export coal and the majority of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity.See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network. Also included on the map, CSX Operating Agreement indicates areas within which CSX can operate through trackage rights beyond the CSX network.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 13CSX CORPORATIONPART ICSX Rail NetworkCSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 14CSX CORPORATIONPART ILocomotivesAt December 2019, CSXT owned more than 3,500 locomotives. From time to time, the Company also short-term leases locomotives based on business needs. Freight locomotives are used primarily to pull trains while switching locomotives are used in yards. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. Of owned locomotives, approximately 65% were in active service as of December 31, 2019, and the remainder were in storage to be utilized as needed. Storing locomotives and equipment allows the Company to quickly adjust its active fleet based on demand and other factors while avoiding delays due to supply limitations or excessive lead times to acquire additional equipment. At December 2019, CSXT’s fleet of owned locomotives consisted of the following types: Locomotives % Average Age(years)Freight3,162 89% 20Switching220 6% 42Auxiliary Units179 5% 27Total3,561 100% 21 EquipmentThe Company owns or long-term leases equipment, including several types of freight cars and intermodal containers. Of total owned and long-term leased equipment, approximately 65% was in active service on December 31, 2019, and the remainder was in storage to be utilized as needed.

Examples of these include railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service), multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared between railroads) and double-stack railcars, or well cars (which are industry pooled), that allow for two intermodal containers to be loaded one above the other. CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 15CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company’s revenue-generating equipment, either owned or long-term leased, consists of freight cars and containers as described below. Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles.Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and industrial sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers.Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions.Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine.Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.Other cars – Primarily leased refrigerator cars and slab steel cars.Containers – Weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight.Item 3.

These decreases were partially offset by merchandise and intermodal pricing gains and favorable mix.Merchandise VolumeChemicals - Declined due to reduced natural gas liquids and fly ash shipments, partially offset by growth in crude oil as well as industrial and municipal waste.Agricultural and Food Products - Increased due to gains in feed grain and ingredients, ethanol, as well as sweeteners and oils.Automotive - Declined due to lower passenger car shipments, partially offset by higher shipments of trucks and SUVs.Minerals - Increased due to higher shipments for highway construction and paving projects.Forest Products - Increased due to higher demand for wood pulp and other fiber products as well as lumber, partially offset by reduced pulpboard shipments.Metals and Equipment - Declined due to reduced metals shipments, primarily in the steel, construction and scrap markets.Fertilizers - Declined due to unfavorable weather conditions throughout the year that impacted fertilizer applications.Coal VolumeDomestic coal declined primarily due to lower shipments of utility coal as a result of continued competition from natural gas, partially offset by stronger shipments for coke, iron ore and other coal. Export coal declined due to lower international shipments of both thermal and metallurgical coal as global benchmark prices declined.Intermodal VolumeDomestic and international intermodal declined primarily due to rationalization of low-density lanes.Other Other revenue decreased $64 million versus prior year primarily due to lower revenue for storage at intermodal facilities and a decrease in settlements from customers that did not meet volume commitments. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable contract settlement with a customer.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 26CSX CORPORATIONPART IIExpenseIn 2019, total expenses decreased $409 million, or 6%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $122 million due to the following items:•Efficiency and volume savings of $157 million primarily resulted from lower headcount and reduced crew starts.•Incentive compensation decreased $12 million primarily due to lower expected annual incentive payouts, partially offset by the acceleration of stock compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees.•Other costs increased $47 million primarily due to inflation that was partially offset by several non-significant items.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items including gains on property dispositions. Total materials, supplies and other expenses decreased $183 million driven by the following:•Efficiency and volume savings of $201 million primarily resulted from lower operating support costs, reduced equipment maintenance expenses and lower terminal and trucking costs. •Gains from real estate and line sales were $151 million in 2019 compared to $154 million in 2018. •All other costs increased $15 million primarily due to inflation and favorable adjustments to casualty reserves in 2018, partially offset by other items.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $18 million due to a larger asset base and a 2019 equipment depreciation study that resulted in $10 million of additional expense, partially offset by other non-significant items. Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $140 million primarily due to an 8% price decrease that drove savings of $74 million, a 4% improvement in fuel efficiency and volume savings.Equipment and Other expenses include rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $13 million primarily due to inflation as well as several non-significant items, partially offset by volume and efficiency savings. Equity Earnings of Affiliates includes earnings from operating equity method investments. Equity earnings of affiliates decreased $5 million primarily due to lower net earnings at TTX.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 27CSX CORPORATIONPART IIInterest ExpenseInterest Expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and finance leases. Interest expense increased $98 million to $737 million primarily due to higher average debt balances, partially offset by lower average rates.Other Income - NetOther Income - Net includes investment gains, losses and interest income, as well as components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. Other income increased $14 million to $88 million primarily due to increased interest income as a result of higher average investment balances.Income Tax ExpenseIncome Tax Expense decreased $10 million primarily due to tax benefits from the impacts of stock option exercises and the vesting of other equity awards as well as the resolution of certain state tax matters, partially offset by benefits in 2018 related to state legislative changes and a federal deferred tax adjustment.Net Earnings and Earnings per Diluted ShareNet Earnings increased $22 million to $3.3 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.33 to $4.17, due to the factors mentioned above. Average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.2018 vs. 2017 Results of OperationsSee discussion of 2018 results of operations compared to 2017 results of operations in Part II, Item 7, ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 28CSX CORPORATIONPART IINon-GAAP Measures - UnauditedCSX reports its financial results in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.2017 Adjusted Operating ResultsManagement believes that adjusted operating income, adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share, assuming dilution are important in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability. These non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude certain significant items that are not considered indicative of future financial trends. The impact of tax reform and the restructuring charge on 2017 operating results are shown in the following table. There were no adjustments to operating results in 2018 or 2019. For the Year ended December 31, 2017(in millions, except operating ratio and net earnings per share, assuming dilution) Operating Income Operating Ratio Net Earnings Net Earnings Per Share, Assuming DilutionGAAP Operating Results 3,720 67.4 5,471 5.99Restructuring Charge (a)(b) 240 (2.1) 203 0.22Tax Reform Benefit (net) (142) 1.2 (3,577) (3.91)Adjusted Operating Results (non-GAAP) $3,818 66.5 % $2,097 $2.30(a) The restructuring charge was tax effected using rates reflective of the applicable tax amounts for each component of the restructuring charge. (b) The total restructuring charge was $325 million, of which $85 million was included in Restructuring Charge - Non-Operating on the consolidated income statement.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 29CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFree Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash FlowManagement believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities, which includes proceeds from property dispositions. Adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of cash payments for restructuring charge. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted free cash flow before dividends increased $279 million year-over-year to $3.5 billion primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities and a decrease in property additions. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (both non-GAAP measures). Fiscal Years 2019 2018 2017(Dollars in Millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$4,850 $4,641 $3,472Property additions (1,657) (1,745) (2,040)Other investing activities285 292 134Free Cash Flow, before dividends (non-GAAP)$3,478 $3,188 $1,566Add back: Cash Payments for Restructuring Charge (after-tax) (a)$— $11 $135Adjusted Free Cash Flow, before dividends (non-GAAP)$3,478 $3,199 $1,701(a) The restructuring charge impact to free cash flow was tax effected using the applicable tax rate of the charge. During 2018 and 2017, the Company made cash payments of $15 million and $187 million, respectively, related to the restructuring charge. Also in 2017, the Company made $30 million in payments to a former CEO and a former President for previously accrued non-qualified pension benefits that are not included in the restructuring charge.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 30CSX CORPORATIONPART IIOperating Statistics (Estimated) Fiscal Years 2019 2018 Improvement/ (Deterioration)Operations Performance Train Velocity (Miles per hour)(a)20.5 18.0 14 %Dwell (Hours)(a)8.6 9.5 9 % Revenue Ton- Miles (Billions) Merchandise128.0 128.1 — %Coal41.1 45.5 (10)%Intermodal26.9 29.3 (8)%Total Revenue Ton-Miles196.0 202.9 (3)% Total Gross Ton-Miles (Billions)388.3 402.7 (4)%On-Time Originations89% 82% 9 %On-Time Arrivals(b)79% 75% 5 % Safety FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index0.88 1.03 15 %FRA Train Accident Rate2.14 3.64 41 %(a) The methodology for calculating train velocity and dwell differ from that prescribed by the STB as the Company believes these numbers more accurately reflect railroad performance. CSXT will continue to report train velocity and dwell, using the prescribed methodology, to the STB on a weekly basis. See additional discussion on the Company's website.(b) During 2019, the calculation of on-time arrivals has changed to consider a train ""on time"" if it is delivered within two hours of scheduled arrival. Prior year periods have been restated to conform to this change.Certain operating statistics are estimated and can continue to be updated as actuals settle.Key Performance Measures DefinitionsTrain Velocity - Average train speed between origin and destination in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains). Train velocity measures the profiled schedule of trains (from departure to arrival and all interim time), and train profiles are periodically updated to align with a changing operation.Dwell - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard.Revenue Ton-Miles (RTM's) - The movement of one revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile.Gross Ton-Miles (GTM's) - The movement of one ton of train weight over one mile. GTM's are calculated by multiplying total train weight by distance the train moved. Total train weight is comprised of the weight of the freight cars and their contents. On-Time Originations - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.On-Time Arrivals - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to within two hours of scheduled arrival. FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours. FRA Train Accident Rate - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.The Company strives for continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. Investment in training and technology also is designed to allow the Company's employees to have an additional layer of protection that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents. Safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.Operating performance continued to improve in 2019, as train velocity and car dwell achieved all-time record levels for the second consecutive year. The operational plan remains focused on delivering further service gains, improving transit times and driving asset utilization while controlling costs.From a safety perspective, FRA personal injury index and train-accident rate improved 15% and 41% from the prior year, respectively. In 2019, the number of FRA reportable injuries and the number of train accidents were both all-time record lows. The Company is committed to continuous safety improvement and remains focused on reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers and the communities in which the Company operates.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 31CSX CORPORATIONPART IILIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its sources and uses of cash, balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed.Significant Cash FlowsThe following charts highlight the components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2019, 2018 and 2017. In 2019, the Company generated $4.9 billion of cash provided by operating activities, which was $209 million higher than prior year primarily driven by favorable working capital activities and higher cash-generating income. In 2018, the Company generated $4.6 billion of cash provided by operating activities, which was $1.2 billion higher than the prior year primarily driven by higher cash-generating income which included the impact of a lower income tax rate, partially offset by lower working capital and other activities. In 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $2.1 billion, an increase in net spend of $418 million from the prior year primarily driven by an increase in net purchases of short-term investments. In 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 billion, an increase of $189 million from the prior year primarily driven by an increase in net short-term investment purchases, partially offset by lower property additions and higher proceeds from property dispositions. In 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $2.6 billion, which represents an increase in net spend of $148 million from the prior year primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and higher debt repayments, partially offset by lower share repurchases. In 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $2.5 billion, which represents an increase of $321 million from the prior year primarily driven by higher share repurchases, partially offset by higher net debt issued.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 32CSX CORPORATIONPART IISources of Cash and LiquidityThe Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in February 2019 which is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. In 2019, CSX issued a total of $2.0 billion of new long-term debt. CSX has access to a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in March 2024. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. The Company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.Uses of CashCSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital requirements, repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time, repurchases of CSX's common stock, capital investments, improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives. In 2019, CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

Of the 2020 investment, the majority will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. The remaining amounts will be allocated to projects supporting service enhancements, productivity initiatives and profitable growth. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations.The Company expects to continue incurring capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC. CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be approximately $2.4 billion. This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. Total PTC spending through 2019 was $2.3 billion. CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 33CSX CORPORATIONPART IICSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). The Company also uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases, share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders. On February 12, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an 8% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.26 per common share. Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working CapitalCSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases. Further, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $2.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $1.5 billion from prior year. The increase in assets was primarily due to the net increase in short-term investments of $743 million, the right-of-use lease asset of $532 million resulting from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, and property additions net of retirements of $295 million. The increase in total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined was driven by net earnings of $3.3 billion, the issuance of $2.0 billion in long-term debt and the total lease liability of $550 million resulting from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard. These increases were partially offset by share repurchases of $3.4 billion and dividends paid of $763 million.Working capital is considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $1.1 billion at December 2019 and $650 million at December 2018. The increase in current assets was primarily driven by cash proceeds from the $2.0 billion issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by dividend payments of $763 million and the early redemption of long-term debt originally due October 2020 of $500 million. The increase in current assets was offset by an increase in current liabilities primarily due to the reclassification of $245 million from long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt.The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. Credit RatingsCredit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 34CSX CORPORATIONPART IIThe cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings remained stable during 2019. As of December 2019 and December 2018, S&P's long-term rating on CSX was BBB+ (Stable), and Moody's was Baa1 (Stable). Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.CSX is committed to returning cash to shareholders and maintaining an investment grade credit profile. Capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors.SCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTSThe following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other significant commitments: Type of Obligation20202021202220232024ThereafterTotal(Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations Total Debt (See Note 10)$245$401$162$639$551$14,240$16,238Interest on Debt72070068667264910,62914,056Purchase Obligations (See Note 8)2921972292542902,4483,710Other Post-Employment Benefits (See Note 9) (a)3729262525108250Operating Leases - Net (See Note 7)58544839371,2081,444Agreements with Conrail (b)2929292922—138Total Contractual Obligations$1,381$1,410$1,180$1,658$1,574$28,633$35,836 Other Commitments (c)$78$2$2$—$—$—$82(a) Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans which are unfunded. No amounts are included for funded pension obligations as no contributions are currently required.(b) Agreements with Conrail represent minimum future payments of $138 million under the shared asset area agreements (see Note 15, Related Party Transactions). (c) Other commitments of $82 million consisted of surety bonds, letters of credit, uncertain tax positions and public private partnerships. Surety bonds of $36 million and letters of credit of $27 million arise from assurances issued by a third-party that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement. Uncertain tax positions of $13 million, which include interest and penalties, are all included in year 2020 as the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated. Contractual commitments related to public-private partnerships are $6 million.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 35CSX CORPORATIONPART IIOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSFor detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.LABOR AGREEMENTSApproximately 17,000 of the Company's nearly 21,000 employees are members of a labor union. In November 2019, notices were served to the 13 rail unions that participate in national bargaining to begin negotiations for benefits, wages and work rules for the next labor bargaining round for 2020. Current agreements remain in place until modified by these negotiations. Typically, such negotiations take several years before agreements are reached.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:•personal injury, environmental and legal reserves;•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting; and•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method.Personal Injury, Environmental and Legal ReservesPersonal InjuryPersonal Injury reserves of $129 million and $143 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves in the consolidated financial statements.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 36CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedEnvironmentalEnvironmental reserves were $74 million and $80 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 220 environmentally impaired sites. The Company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:•type of clean-up required;•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.Conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves in the consolidated financial statements.LegalThe Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan AccountingThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. Beginning in 2020, the CSX Pension Plan is closed to new participants. As of December 2019, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $3.1 billion.In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a non-contributory life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Beginning in 2019, both the life insurance benefit for eligible active employees and health savings account contributions made by the Company to eligible retirees younger than 65 were eliminated. Beginning in 2020, the employer-funded health reimbursement arrangements for eligible retirees 65 years or older were eliminated. As a result of these plan amendments, the Company recognized a decrease in 2018 of $102 million in the post-retirement benefit liability. As of December 2019, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s other post-retirement benefit plans was $117 million.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 37CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedFor information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans.The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;•long-term rate of return on plan assets;•salary scale inflation rates; and•other assumptions.The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. These amounts are reviewed by management.Discount RatesDiscount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.The Company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and post-retirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity. The weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its 2019 pension and post-retirement obligations are 3.13 percent and 2.87 percent, respectively. For 2018, the weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations were 4.24 percent and 3.98 percent, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2019, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 7 years, respectively. Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 38CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedLong-term Rate of Return on Plan AssetsThe expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75 percent in both 2019 and 2018.Salary Scale Inflation RatesSalary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.60 percent in both 2019 and 2018 to value its pension obligations.Other AssumptionsThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.2020 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement ExpenseNet periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2020 are expected to be a $5 million expense and a $2 million credit, respectively. Net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2020 are expected to include service cost expense of $40 million and $1 million, respectively. Service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense are included in other income - net. Net periodic pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense in 2019 were credits of $7 million and $4 million, respectively. The net increase in the expected expense is primarily due to impacts from the decline in discount rates, partially offset by favorable pension asset experience.The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a one percent change in certain assumptions like discount rates, long-term rate of return and salaries on the 2020 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:(Dollars in Millions) Pension Expense Post-Retirement ExpenseDiscount Rate $13 $—Long-term Rate of Return $26 N/ASalary Inflation $6 N/ACSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 39CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedDepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life MethodThe depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 87% of total fixed assets of $45 billion on a gross basis at December 31, 2019. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. Land is not depreciated. Management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;•evaluation of current operations;•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;•previous assessment of the condition of the assets; •management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.In 2019, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. The effect of this change in estimate was not material to depreciation expense in 2019. The continued impacts of the study are expected to result in additional depreciation expense of approximately $30 million in 2020. There were no depreciation studies in 2018 or 2017. A one percent change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $12 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense.

CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 41CSX CORPORATIONPART IIThe following important factors, in addition to those discussed in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements: •legislative, regulatory or legal developments involving transportation, including rail or intermodal transportation, the environment, hazardous materials, taxation, international trade and initiatives to further regulate the rail industry;•the outcome of litigation, claims and other contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge, environmental matters, taxes, shipper and rate claims subject to adjudication, personal injuries and occupational illnesses;•changes in domestic or international economic, political or business conditions, including those affecting the transportation industry (such as the impact of industry competition, conditions, performance and consolidation, as well as the impact of international trade agreements and tariffs) and the level of demand for products carried by CSXT;•natural events such as severe weather conditions, including floods, fire, hurricanes and earthquakes, a pandemic crisis affecting the health of the Company's employees, its shippers or the consumers of goods, or other unforeseen disruptions of the Company's operations, systems, property, equipment or supply chain;•competition from other modes of freight transportation, such as trucking, and competition and consolidation or financial distress within the transportation industry generally; •the cost of compliance with laws and regulations that differ from expectations (including those associated with PTC implementation) as well as costs, penalties and operational and liquidity impacts associated with noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations;•the impact of increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas, including potential effects of high speed rail initiatives, or regulatory changes affecting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes;•unanticipated conditions in the financial markets that may affect timely access to capital markets and the cost of capital, as well as management's decisions regarding share repurchases; •changes in fuel prices, surcharges for fuel and the availability of fuel;•the impact of natural gas prices on coal-fired electricity generation;•the impact of global supply and price of seaborne coal on CSX's export coal market;•availability of insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or insufficient insurance coverage to cover claims or damages;•the inherent business risks associated with safety and security, including the transportation of hazardous materials or a cybersecurity attack which would threaten the availability and vulnerability of information technology;•adverse economic or operational effects from actual or threatened war or terrorist activities and any governmental response;CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 42CSX CORPORATIONPART II•loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees;•labor and benefit costs and labor difficulties, including stoppages affecting either the Company's operations or customers' ability to deliver goods to the Company for shipment;•the Company's success in implementing its strategic, financial and operational initiatives; •the impact of conditions in the real estate market on the Company's ability to sell assets;•changes in operating conditions and costs or commodity concentrations; and•the inherent uncertainty associated with projecting economic and business conditions.Other important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified elsewhere in this report and in CSX's other SEC reports, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Company's website at www.csx.com. The information on the CSX website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 2019, CSX does not have a material amount of floating rate debt obligations outstanding, and therefore fluctuations in the interest rate would not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Changes in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt. The potential decrease in fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates, or approximately 25 basis points, is estimated to be $498 million as of December 31, 2019 and $472 million as of December 31, 2018. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.CSX 2019 Form 10-K p. 43CSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 8.

Risk Factors The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Regulatory, Legislative and LegalNew legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.Legislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs, including income taxes, and profitability of the Company's business. In addition, statutes or regulations imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs, adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. Noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.8CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates.Operational, Safety and Business DisruptionAn epidemic or pandemic, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the initiatives to reduce its transmission could adversely affect the Company's business.The Company could be materially and adversely affected by a public health crisis, including a widespread epidemic or pandemic. As COVID-19 has spread globally, including significant impacts in the United States, CSX continues to take a variety of measures to ensure the availability of its transportation services, promote the safety and security of its employees and support the communities in which it operates. However, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as closures of businesses and manufacturing facilities, the promotion of social distancing, the adoption of working from home by companies and institutions, and travel restrictions could continue to adversely affect demand for the commodities and products that the Company transports, including import and export volume. In addition, COVID-19 and the related initiatives to reduce transmission may result in greater supply chain disruption, which could continue to have an adverse impact on volumes and make it more difficult for the Company to serve its customers. The extent to which this coronavirus impacts operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of this coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. Moreover, operations could be negatively affected if a significant number of employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects the Company's business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described under Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of this annual report on Form 10-K.The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. Such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages. A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect. CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.9CSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency.CSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) unpredictable increases in demand; (ii) locomotive or crew shortages; (iii) extreme weather conditions; (iv) impacts from changes in yard capacity, or network structure or composition, including train routes; (v) increased passenger activities; or (vi) regulatory changes impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes, which could impact CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available.Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.10CSX CORPORATIONPART ICompetitive, Economic and FinancialThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers.The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.Global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, slower rates of economic growth in Asia, contraction of European economies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on U.S. export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for CSX. Additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Increases in production and source locations of natural gas in the U.S. have resulted in lower natural gas prices in CSX’s service territory. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Additionally, crude oil prices combined with changes in pipeline capacity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production, which has affected crude oil volumes for CSX.Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.The Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.11CSX CORPORATIONPART IClimate Change and EnvironmentalThe Company’s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change.There is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the Company's operational territory, which could impact the Company's network or other assets. Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations, including any proposed or implemented under the Biden administration, could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.12CSX CORPORATIONPART IAvailability of Critical Supplies and LaborDisruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.The capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rail, ties, rolling stock equipment and locomotives) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are either bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee or locally between CSX and the union. Such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. The unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and conductors, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company believes that it has adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNoneCSX 2020 Form 10-K p.13CSX CORPORATIONPART IItem 2. PropertiesThe Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.Track and InfrastructureServing 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern markets of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.CSXT’s track structure includes mainline track, connecting terminals and yards, track within terminals and switching yards, sidings used for passing trains, track connecting CSXT's track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads, are greater than CSXT’s approximately 19,500 route miles. At December 2020, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track MilesSingle mainline track19,605 Other mainline track5,695 Terminals and switching yards9,289 Passing sidings and turnouts896 Total35,485 In addition to its physical track structure, the Company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service. These serve as points of connectivity between the Company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers are received, classed for destination and placed onto outbound trains, or arrive and are delivered to the customer. The Company’s largest yards and terminals based on 2020 volume (number of railcars or intermodal containers processed) are listed below.Yards and TerminalsAnnual VolumeWaycross, GA907,445 Bedford Park Intermodal Terminal (Chicago)896,474 Nashville, TN653,643 Avon, IN (Indianapolis)626,868 Cincinnati, OH603,773 Selkirk, NY597,966 Fairburn, GA Intermodal Terminal (Atlanta)424,377 Walbridge, OH (Toledo)389,169 Chicago, IL334,743 Louisville, KY296,277 CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.14CSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork Geography CSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors that are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These engineering attributes permit the corridor to support high-speed service across intermodal, automotive and merchandise commodities. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, intermodal and coal.Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia and provides access to major eastern ports.Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Southeast, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. The domestic coal market has declined significantly over the last decade and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility. CSXT’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Approximately one-quarter to one-third of export coal and the majority of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity or industrial purposes. See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network. Also included on the map, CSX Operating Agreement indicates areas within which CSX can operate through trackage rights beyond the CSX network.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.15CSX CORPORATIONPART ICSX Rail NetworkCSX 2020 Form 10-K p.16CSX CORPORATIONPART ILocomotivesAs of December 2020, CSXT owns or long-term leases more than 3,500 locomotives. From time to time, the Company also short-term leases locomotives based on business needs. Freight locomotives are used primarily to pull trains while switching locomotives are used in yards. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. Of owned locomotives, approximately 66% were in active service as of December 31, 2020, and the remainder were in storage to be utilized as needed. Storing locomotives and equipment allows the Company to quickly adjust its active fleet based on demand and other factors while avoiding delays due to supply limitations or excessive lead times to acquire additional equipment. As of December 2020, CSXT’s fleet of owned or long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following types: Locomotives%Average Age(years)Freight3,142 89 %21 Switching219 6 %42 Auxiliary units178 5 %28 Total locomotives3,539 100 %21 EquipmentThe Company owns or long-term leases equipment, including several types of freight cars and intermodal containers. Of total owned and long-term leased equipment, approximately 77% was in active service as of December 31, 2020, and the remainder were in storage to be utilized as needed. As of December 2020, the Company’s owned and long-term leased equipment consisted of the following:EquipmentNumber of Units%Gondolas18,656 37 %Multi-level flat cars11,161 22 %Covered hoppers7,832 16 %Open-top hoppers6,970 14 %Box cars4,247 9 %Flat cars658 1 %Other cars242 1 %Subtotal freight cars49,766 100 %Containers17,434 Total equipment67,200 At any time, over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by the Company. Examples of these include railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service), multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared between railroads) and double-stack railcars, or well cars (which are industry pooled), that allow for two intermodal containers to be loaded one above the other. CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.17CSX CORPORATIONPART I The Company’s revenue-generating equipment, either owned or long-term leased, consists of freight cars and containers as described below. Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles.Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and industrial sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers.Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions.Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine.Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.Other cars – Primarily leased refrigerator cars and slab steel cars.Containers – Weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight.Item 3.

Demand for rail services saw large and rapid declines in the first half of the year, followed by steep sequential increases in the second half, but the effects of the disruption of global manufacturing, supply chains and consumer spending as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing. While operating cash flows have also been impacted by these economic conditions, the Company maintains a strong cash balance and access to committed funding sources and other sources of external liquidity if required. As this is a dynamic situation, it is difficult to determine the future impacts of the pandemic. The full implications of COVID-19, including the extent of its impact on the Company’s financial and operating results, will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues, its effect on the demand for the Company’s transportation services and the supply chain, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic. The duration of the pandemic is dependent on several factors, including the timing of vaccine production and distribution as well as the impacts of virus mutations and case resurgences across the country.CSX employees that provide efficient and reliable rail service are essential to keeping supply chains fluid in response to this challenge. Accordingly, business operations have been modified to ensure the safety of employees across the network while continuing to provide a high level of service to customers. A cross-functional task force monitors and coordinates the Company’s response to COVID-19. Policies and procedures established to protect the health and safety of employees and customers and to safeguard CSX operations include rigorous cleaning regimens for equipment and facilities, provision of sanitation supplies, distribution of disposable face coverings, facilitation of social distancing measures and administration of temperature testing at certain facilities. These precautions remain in place despite the easing of pandemic restrictions by state and local governments across the network. Additionally, remote work arrangements have been made where possible in order to reduce the density of employees in a single location, and alternative locations for key functions, such as dispatch, are being utilized as needed.In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted to provide relief to businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant remaining impact to the Company is the deferral of certain payroll tax payments to 2021 and 2022. The provisions of the CARES Act are not expected to have an impact on CSX’s results of operations or effective tax rate.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.26CSX CORPORATIONPART IIVolume and Revenue (Unaudited) Volume (Thousands of units); Revenue (Dollars in Millions); Revenue Per Unit (Dollars) VolumeRevenueRevenue Per Unit 20202019% Change20202019% Change20202019% Change Chemicals(a)664 670 (1)%$2,309 $2,349 (2)%$3,477 $3,506 (1)%Agricultural and Food Products463 469 (1)%1,386 1,410 (2)%2,994 3,006 — %Automotive344 456 (25)%920 1,236 (26)%2,674 2,711 (1)%Minerals(a) 321 337 (5)%538 559 (4)%1,676 1,659 1 %Forest Products(a)270 283 (5)%824 862 (4)%3,052 3,046 — %Metals and Equipment(a)239 249 (4)%675 742 (9)%2,824 2,980 (5)%Fertilizers234 243 (4)%424 431 (2)%1,812 1,774 2 %Total Merchandise2,535 2,707 (6)%7,076 7,589 (7)%2,791 2,803 — %Intermodal2,720 2,670 2 %1,702 1,760 (3)%626 659 (5)%Coal637 843 (24)%1,397 2,070 (33)%2,193 2,456 (11)%Other— — — %408 518 (21)%— — — %Total5,892 6,220 (5)%$10,583 $11,937 (11)%$1,796 $1,919 (6)%(a) In first quarter 2020, changes were made in the categorization of certain lines of business, impacting Chemicals, Minerals, Forest Products, and Metals and Equipment. The impacts were not material and prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.27CSX CORPORATIONPART IIRevenue The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted overall volume in 2020. Total revenue decreased $1.4 billion, in 2020 or 11%, when compared to the previous year due to declines in coal, lower merchandise volumes, decreases in fuel recovery and lower other revenue. These decreases were partially offset by pricing increases in merchandise and volume and pricing increases in intermodal.Merchandise VolumeChemicals - Declined due to reduced frac sand and waste shipments, partially offset by growth in plastics shipments.Agricultural and Food Products - Decreased due to lower shipments of feed grain as well as food and consumer products, partially offset by growth in sweeteners and oils.Automotive - Declined due to lower North American vehicle production.Minerals - Decreased due to lower shipments for aggregates and other minerals.Forest Products - Declined due to lower shipments of printing paper and building products, partially offset by higher pulpboard shipments.Metals and Equipment - Declined due to lower metals shipments, primarily in the steel, construction and scrap markets, as well as reduced equipment shipments.Fertilizers - Declined due to reduced short-haul phosphate shipments.Intermodal VolumeIncreases in both domestic and international shipments resulted from tightening truck capacity and inventory replenishments in the second half of the year and growth in rail volumes from east coast ports.Coal VolumeDomestic coal declined primarily due to lower shipments of utility coal as a result of continued competition from natural gas and reduced electrical demand, as well as lower steel and industrial shipments due to lower industrial production. Export coal declined due to reduced international shipments of thermal and metallurgical coal as a result of lower global benchmark prices.Other Other revenue decreased $110 million versus prior year primarily due to lower affiliate revenue, lower revenue for demurrage and a favorable contract settlement with a customer in the prior year. CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.28CSX CORPORATIONPART IIExpense In 2020, total expenses decreased $751 million, or 11%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $341 million due to the following items:•Efficiency and volume savings of $288 million primarily resulted from structural changes to the train plan that resulted in reduced crew starts as well as lower headcount.•Incentive compensation decreased $86 million primarily due to lower expected annual incentive payouts as well as higher prior year accelerated stock compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees.•Other costs increased $33 million primarily due to inflation and several other non-significant items, including severance costs.Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items including gains on property dispositions. Total materials, supplies and other expenses decreased $65 million driven by the following:•Efficiency and volume savings of $185 million primarily resulted from lower operating support costs, lower terminal costs as a result of record productivity levels at intermodal terminals, and reduced equipment maintenance expenses. •Gains from real estate and line sales were $35 million in 2020 compared to $151 million in 2019. •All other costs increased $4 million primarily due to inflation and other non-significant costs that were mostly offset by a $22 million non-railroad asset impairment in the prior year related to an intermodal terminal sale agreement.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $34 million primarily due to the impacts of the 2019 equipment depreciation study as well as a larger net asset base.Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $365 million primarily due to a 31% price decrease that drove savings of $243 million, volume savings and a 5% improvement in fuel efficiency.Equipment and Other expenses include rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses decreased $14 million primarily due to volume savings, partially offset by higher days per load for automotive and other merchandise markets that resulted in increased car hire costs.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.29CSX CORPORATIONPART IIInterest ExpenseInterest Expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and finance leases. Interest expense increased $17 million as higher average debt balances were partially offset by lower average rates.Other Income - NetOther Income - Net includes investment gains, losses and interest income, as well as components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. Other income decreased $69 million primarily due to a $38 million increase in debt repurchase expense and decreased interest income driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash and short-term investment balances.Income Tax ExpenseIncome Tax Expense decreased $123 million primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes, partially offset by lower tax benefits from the impacts of stock option exercises and the vesting of other equity awards as well as prior year benefits from the resolution of certain state tax matters.Net Earnings and Earnings per Diluted ShareNet Earnings decreased $566 million to $2.8 billion, and earnings per diluted share decreased $0.57 to $3.60, due to the factors mentioned above. Average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.2019 vs. 2018 Results of Operations See discussion of 2019 results of operations compared to 2018 results of operations in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.30CSX CORPORATIONPART IINon-GAAP Measures - Unaudited CSX reports its financial results in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.Free Cash Flow Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities, which includes proceeds from property dispositions. This measure should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow before dividends decreased $832 million year-over-year to $2.6 billion primarily due to lower net cash provided by operating activities and lower proceeds from property dispositions. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (both non-GAAP measures).

CSXT will continue to report these metrics, using the prescribed methodology, to the STB on a weekly basis. See additional discussion on the Company's website.Certain operating statistics are estimated and can continue to be updated as actuals settle.Key Performance Measures Definitions:Train Velocity - Average train speed between origin and destination in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains). Train velocity measures the profiled schedule of trains (from departure to arrival and all interim time), and train profiles are periodically updated to align with a changing operation.Dwell - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard.Cars Online - Average number of active freight rail cars on lines operated by CSX, excluding rail cars that are being repaired, in storage, those that have been sold, or private cars dwelling at a customer location more than one day.Revenue Ton-Miles (RTM's) - The movement of one revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile.Gross Ton-Miles (GTM's) - The movement of one ton of train weight over one mile. GTM's are calculated by multiplying total train weight by distance the train moved. Total train weight is comprised of the weight of the freight cars and their contents. On-Time Originations - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on time or ahead of schedule.On-Time Arrivals - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on time to within two hours of scheduled arrival. FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours. FRA Train Accident Rate - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles. The Company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. Training and safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. Technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an additional layer of protection for the Company's employees. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance. Despite operating challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company remained focused on safety, service and controlling costs. Train velocity was roughly in line with last year’s record performance, declining 1% relative to 2019. Dwell increased by 8% compared to last year, while cars online decreased by 4% in 2020. CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.32CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFrom a safety perspective, the FRA personal injury index improved 10% and train-accident rate increased 17% from the prior year. In 2020, the number of FRA reportable injuries reached a new all-time record low for the second consecutive year. The number of FRA reportable train accidents remained at a record-low level, but a reduction in train miles negatively impacted the FRA train accident rate. The Company is committed to operational and safety improvement, while remaining focused on reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers and communities in which the Company operates.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its sources and uses of cash, balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed.Significant Cash Flows The following charts highlight the components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2020 and 2019. In 2020, the Company generated $4.3 billion of cash provided by operating activities, which was $587 million lower than prior year primarily driven by lower cash-generating income and unfavorable working capital activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $649 million, a decrease in net spend of $1.5 billion from the prior year primarily as a result of higher net sales of short-term investments, partially offset by lower proceeds from property dispositions. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion, which represents a decrease in net spend of $1.2 billion from the prior year primarily driven by lower share repurchases, partially offset by lower proceeds from debt issuances and higher debt repayments. Sources of Cash and Liquidity The Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in February 2019 which is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. In 2020, CSX issued a total of $1.0 billion of new long-term debt. CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.33CSX CORPORATIONPART II CSX has access to a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in March 2024. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. The Company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.Uses of Cash CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital requirements, repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time, repurchases of CSX's common stock, capital investments, improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives. The Company also uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases. In 2020, CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below. Fiscal YearsCapital Expenditures (Dollars in Millions)20202019Track$858 $860 Bridges, Signals and Other508 493 Total Infrastructure1,366 1,353 Strategic Projects and Commercial Facilities143 141 Locomotives57 55 Regulatory (including PTC)39 91 Freight Cars21 17 Total Capital Expenditures $1,626 1,657 Planned capital investments for 2021 are expected to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. Of the total 2021 investment, the majority will be used to sustain the core infrastructure and the remaining amounts will be allocated to projects supporting service enhancements, productivity initiatives and profitable growth. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations. PTC implementation is complete at a total cost of $2.4 billion, which included installing new equipment along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. While the Company expects ongoing PTC costs, future PTC implementation costs are not expected to be material. CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.34CSX CORPORATIONPART IICSX is committed to returning cash to shareholders. Capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors. On February 10, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an 8% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.28 per common share. Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances.Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working Capital CSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases. Further, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $3.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $1.5 billion from prior year end. The increase in assets was primarily due to the net increase of $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments as well as $276 million in net property additions. The net increase in cash and short-term investments was driven by $4.3 billion in cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of $1.0 billion of long-term debt. These increases were partially offset by property additions of $1.6 billion, share repurchases of $867 million, dividends paid of $797 million and long-term debt repayments of $745 million.Total liabilities increased $289 million from prior year end primarily due to the issuance of $1.0 billion of long-term debt and a $207 million increase in deferred tax liabilities primarily driven by accelerated tax depreciation. These increases were partially offset by debt repayments of $745 million and a $234 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to the conversion of accounts payable to Conrail into notes payable. Total shareholders' equity increased $1.2 billion from prior year end primarily driven by net earnings of $2.8 billion, partially offset by share repurchases of $867 million and dividends paid of $797 million. Working capital is considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $2.4 billion at December 2020 and $1.1 billion at December 2019, an increase of $1.3 billion. The increase in current assets was primarily driven by the net increase in cash and short-term investments described above and the decrease in current liabilities was due to lower accounts payable partially offset by higher current maturities of long-term debt. The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.35CSX CORPORATIONPART IICredit Ratings Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings remained stable during 2020. As of December 2020 and December 2019, S&P's long-term rating on CSX was BBB+ (Stable), and Moody's was Baa1 (Stable). Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment-grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt. The Company is committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.Guaranteed Notes Issued By CSXTIn March 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to reduce and simplify the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed registered securities effective January 4, 2021, with early voluntary compliance permitted. CSX elected to comply with these amendments effective second quarter 2020. As a result, separate condensed consolidating financial information for wholly-owned subsidiaries who issued or guaranteed notes is no longer included in the footnotes to the financial statements in Quarterly and Annual Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. Also in accordance with the amendments, CSX is not required to present combined summary financial information regarding such subsidiary issuers and guarantors because the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined issuers and guarantors of the notes are not materially different from the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements.In 2007, CSXT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX Corporation, issued $381 million of secured equipment notes maturing in 2023 in a registered public offering. CSX Corporation has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes. At CSXT’s option, CSXT may redeem any or all of the notes, in whole or in part, at any time, at the redemption price including premium. In the case of loss or destruction of any item of equipment securing the notes, if CSXT does not substitute another item of equipment for the item suffering such loss or destruction, CSXT will be required to redeem the notes in part at par. The guarantee of the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of CSX Corporation and will be effectively subordinated to all future secured indebtedness of CSX Corporation to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. The guarantee is subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. As of December 31, 2020, the principal balance of these secured equipment notes was $160 million.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.36CSX CORPORATIONPART IISCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other significant commitments: Type of Obligation20212022202320242025ThereafterTotal(Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations Total Debt (See Note 10)$401 $162 $139 $551 $601 $14,851 $16,705 Interest on Debt712 698 684 680 661 10,805 14,240 Purchase Obligations (See Note 8)234 226 248 284 298 1,985 3,275 Other Post-Employment Benefits (a)33 26 25 25 24 102 235 Operating Leases - Net (See Note 7)47 43 36 36 35 1,172 1,369 Agreements with Conrail (See Note 15)30 30 30 22 — — 112 Total Contractual Obligations$1,457 $1,185 $1,162 $1,598 $1,619 $28,915 $35,936 Other Commitments (b)$74 $2 $— $— $— $— $76 (a) Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans that are unfunded.

See Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans.(b) Other commitments of $76 million consisted of surety bonds, letters of credit, uncertain tax positions and public private partnerships. Surety bonds of $29 million and letters of credit of $27 million arise from assurances issued by a third-party that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement. Uncertain tax positions of $16 million, which include interest and penalties, are all included in year 2021 as the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated. Contractual commitments related to public-private partnerships are $4 million.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.37CSX CORPORATIONPART IIOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS For detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.LABOR AGREEMENTS Approximately 15,700 of the Company's nearly 19,300 employees are members of a labor union. In November 2019, notices were served to the 13 rail unions that participate in national bargaining to begin negotiations for benefits, wages and work rules for the next labor bargaining round for 2020. Current agreements remain in place until modified by these negotiations. Typically, such negotiations take several years before agreements are reached.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:•personal injury, environmental and legal reserves;•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting; and•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method.Personal Injury, Environmental and Legal ReservesPersonal Injury Personal Injury reserves of $131 million and $129 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves in the consolidated financial statements.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.38CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedEnvironmental Environmental reserves were $76 million and $74 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 220 environmentally impaired sites. The Company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:•type of clean-up required;•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location. Conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves in the consolidated financial statements.Legal The Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired between 2003 and 2019, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. Beginning in 2020, the CSX Pension Plan was closed to new participants. As of December 2020, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $3.3 billion.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.39CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedIn addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Changes to the post-retirement medical and life insurance plans were communicated to participants in October 2018. Beginning in 2019, both the life insurance benefit for eligible active employees and health savings account contributions made by the Company to eligible retirees younger than 65 were eliminated. Beginning in 2020, the employer-funded health reimbursement arrangements for eligible retirees 65 years or older were eliminated. As a result of these plan amendments, the Company recognized a decrease of $102 million in the post-retirement benefit liability and a corresponding gain in other comprehensive income in 2018. As of December 2020, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s other post-retirement benefit plans was $96 million.For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;•long-term rate of return on plan assets;•salary scale inflation rates; and•other assumptions. The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. These amounts are reviewed by management.Discount Rates Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments. The Company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and post-retirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity. CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.40CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedThe weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its 2020 pension and post-retirement obligations are 2.43 percent and 2.07 percent, respectively. For 2019, the weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations were 3.13 percent and 2.87 percent, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2020, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years, respectively. Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management, with the assistance of an outsourced investment manager, balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75 percent in both 2020 and 2019.Salary Scale Inflation Rates Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.60 percent in both 2020 and 2019 to value its pension obligations.Other Assumptions The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.2021 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense Net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2021 are expected to be a $21 million credit and a $5 million credit, respectively. Net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2021 are expected to include service cost expense of $38 million and $1 million, respectively. Service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense are included in other income - net. Net periodic pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense in 2020 were costs of $3 million and less than $1 million, respectively. The net decrease in the expected expense is primarily due to expected favorable pension asset experience.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.41CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedThe following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a one percent change in certain assumptions like discount rates, long-term rate of return and salaries on the 2021 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:(Dollars in Millions)Pension ExpensePost-Retirement ExpenseDiscount Rate$20 $1 Long-term Rate of Return$28 N/ASalary Inflation$5 N/ADepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method The depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 87% of total fixed assets of $45.5 billion on a gross basis at December 31, 2020. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. Land is not depreciated. Management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;•evaluation of current operations;•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;•previous assessment of the condition of the assets; •management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies. The Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2019, both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the Company's depreciation expense of $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A one percent change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $12 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. If the Company does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be drawn that the Company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements. The following important factors, in addition to those discussed in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements: •legislative, regulatory or legal developments involving transportation, including rail or intermodal transportation, the environment, hazardous materials, taxation, international trade and initiatives to further regulate the rail industry;•the outcome of litigation, claims and other contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge, environmental matters, taxes, shipper and rate claims subject to adjudication, personal injuries and occupational illnesses;CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.43CSX CORPORATIONPART II•changes in domestic or international economic, political or business conditions, including those affecting the transportation industry (such as the impact of industry competition, conditions, performance and consolidation, as well as the impact of international trade agreements and tariffs) and the level of demand for products carried by CSXT;•natural events such as severe weather conditions, including floods, fire, hurricanes and earthquakes, a pandemic crisis affecting the health of the Company's employees, its shippers or the consumers of goods, or other unforeseen disruptions of the Company's operations, systems, property, equipment or supply chain;•competition from other modes of freight transportation, such as trucking, and competition and consolidation or financial distress within the transportation industry generally; •the cost of compliance with laws and regulations that differ from expectations as well as costs, penalties and operational and liquidity impacts associated with noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations;•the impact of increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas, including potential effects of high speed rail initiatives, or regulatory changes affecting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes;•unanticipated conditions in the financial markets that may affect timely access to capital markets and the cost of capital, as well as management's decisions regarding share repurchases; •changes in fuel prices, surcharges for fuel and the availability of fuel;•the impact of natural gas prices on coal-fired electricity generation;•the impact of global supply and price of seaborne coal on CSX's export coal market;•availability of insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or insufficient insurance coverage to cover claims or damages;•the inherent business risks associated with safety and security, including the transportation of hazardous materials or a cybersecurity attack which would threaten the availability and vulnerability of information technology;•adverse economic or operational effects from actual or threatened war or terrorist activities and any governmental response;•loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees;•labor and benefit costs and labor difficulties, including stoppages affecting either the Company's operations or customers' ability to deliver goods to the Company for shipment;•the Company's success in implementing its strategic, financial and operational initiatives; •the impact of conditions in the real estate market on the Company's ability to sell assets;•changes in operating conditions and costs or commodity concentrations; •the continued and uncertain impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and•the inherent uncertainty associated with projecting economic and business conditions. Other important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified elsewhere in this report and in CSX's other SEC reports, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Company's website at www.csx.com. The information on the CSX website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.44CSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Changes in interest rates may impact the cost of future long-term debt issued by the Company, and as a result, represent interest rate risk to the Company. In an effort to manage this risk, CSX may use certain financial instruments such as interest rate forward contracts. The following information, together with information included in Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements, describes the key aspects of such contracts and the related market risk to CSX.Changes in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's forward starting interest rate swap. On both April 29, 2020, and July 9, 2020, the Company executed a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional value of $250 million for an aggregate notional value of $500 million. These swaps were effected to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with future interest payments related to the anticipated refinancing of notes due in 2027. The Company recognized an unrealized gain of $62 million net of tax during the year ended December 31, 2020 in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income with the related asset on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Upon settlement of the swaps, which expire in 2027, the unrealized gain or loss in AOCI will be recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2020, the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be material. As of December 2020, CSX has no floating rate debt obligations outstanding. However, changes in interest rates could impact the fair value (but not the carrying value) of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt. The potential decrease in fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates, or approximately 15 basis points, is estimated to be $428 million as of December 31, 2020. The underlying fair values of the Company's long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.CSX 2020 Form 10-K p.45CSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 8.

Risk Factors The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Regulatory, Legislative and LegalNew legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.Legislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs, including income taxes, and profitability of the Company's business. In addition, statutes or regulations imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs, adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. Noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.7CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates.Operational, Safety and Business DisruptionAn epidemic or pandemic, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the initiatives to reduce its transmission could adversely affect the Company's business.The Company could be materially and adversely affected by a public health crisis, including a widespread epidemic or pandemic. As COVID-19 and its variant strains have spread globally, including significant impacts in the United States, CSX continues to take a variety of measures to ensure the availability of its transportation services, promote the safety and security of its employees and support the communities in which it operates. However, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as closures of businesses and manufacturing facilities, the promotion of social distancing, the adoption of working from home by companies and institutions, and travel restrictions could continue to adversely affect demand for the commodities and products that the Company transports, including import and export volume. In addition, COVID-19 and the related initiatives to reduce transmission have resulted in greater supply chain disruption, which could continue to impact volumes and make it more difficult for the Company to serve its customers. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, its effects on demand for the Company’s transportation services and the supply chain, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic. The duration of the pandemic is dependent on several factors, including the impacts of virus variants and case resurgences across the country. Moreover, operations are negatively affected when a significant number of employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects the Company's business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The security, stability and availability of the Company’s and its key third-party vendors’ technology systems are critical to its ability to operate safely and effectively and to compete within the transportation industry. A successful data breach, cyber-attack, or the occurrence of any similar incident that impacts the Company’s or its key third-party vendors’ information technology systems could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), process failure, or other operational difficulties. A disruption or compromise of the Company’s information technology systems, even for short periods of time, and any resulting theft or compromise of Company confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), could adversely affect the Company’s business or reputation, create significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure and have a material adverse impact on CSX’s business, financial condition or operations.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.8CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company, its third-party vendors and other companies in the rail and transportation industries have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, data breaches, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents. These incidents may include, among other things, malware, ransomware, distributed denial of service attacks, social engineering, phishing, theft, malfeasance or improper access by employees or third-party vendors, human error, fraud, or other modes of attack or disruption. Attacks of these nature are increasing in frequency, levels of persistence, intensity and sophistication. Further, the Company may be at increased risk of a cyber-attack as a result of being a component of the critical U.S. infrastructure. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities, data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic also increases the risk that the Company or its third-party vendors may experience cybersecurity incidents as a result of employees, third-party vendors and other third parties with which they interact working remotely on less secure systems and environments.Despite the Company’s efforts to protect its information technology systems, it may not be able to prevent or anticipate all data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents, detect or react to such incidents in a timely manner or adequately remediate any such incident. While CSX’s security protocols have detected attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Company’s information technology systems, none of such attempts have resulted in any material breach of or disruption to the Company’s systems. For example, CSX has experienced distributed denial of service attacks that have resulted in brief system disruptions, but none have resulted in access to CSX systems. Additionally, despite routine security assessment of the Company’s key third-party vendors, some vendors have experienced cyber-attacks in the past, but none of such attacks have had a material adverse impact on CSX’s business or operations. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, CSX may be held responsible for data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents attributed to its third-party vendors as they relate to the information CSX shares with them.Network or supply chain constraints could have a negative impact on service, operating efficiency or volume of shipments.CSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) unpredictable increases in demand; (ii) locomotive or crew shortages; (iii) labor shortages or other service disruptions in the supply chain affecting trucking, ports, handling facilities, customer facilities or other railroads; (iv) reductions in availability of pooled equipment, including chassis; (v) extreme weather conditions; (vi) impacts from changes in yard capacity, or network structure or composition, including train routes; (vii) increased passenger activities; or (viii) regulatory changes resulting in forced access or impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes, which could impact CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.9CSX CORPORATIONPART IFurthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.Competitive, Economic and FinancialThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers.The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.Global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, slower rates of economic growth in Asia, contraction of European economies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on U.S. export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for CSX. Additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.10CSX CORPORATIONPART IChanging dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Over time, changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets have resulted in lower energy production from coal-fired power plants in CSX's service territory. Changes in natural gas prices, or other factors impacting demand for electricity, could impact future power generation at coal-fired plants, which would affect the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.The Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.Availability of Critical Supplies and LaborThe unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and conductors, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company strives to maintain adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period. Disruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.The capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rail, ties, rolling stock equipment and locomotives) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are either bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee or locally between CSX and the union. Such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.11CSX CORPORATIONPART IClimate Change and EnvironmentalThe Company’s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change.There is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the Company's operational territory, which could impact the Company's network or other assets. Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations, including any proposed or implemented under the Biden administration, could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNoneCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.12CSX CORPORATIONPART IItem 2. PropertiesThe Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.Track and InfrastructureServing 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern markets of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.CSXT’s track structure includes mainline track, connecting terminals and yards, track within terminals and switching yards, sidings used for passing trains, track connecting CSXT's track to customer locations and turnouts that divert trains from one track to another. Total track miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads, are greater than CSXT’s approximately 19,500 route miles. At December 2021, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track MilesSingle mainline track19,433 Other mainline track5,707 Terminals and switching yards9,278 Passing sidings and turnouts887 Total35,305 In addition to its physical track structure, the Company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service. These serve as points of connectivity between the Company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers are received, classed for destination and placed onto outbound trains, or arrive and are delivered to the customer. The Company’s largest yards and terminals based on 2021 volume (number of railcars or intermodal containers processed) are listed below.Yards and TerminalsAnnual VolumeWaycross, GA930,621 Bedford Park Intermodal Terminal (Chicago)916,805 Avon, IN (Indianapolis)671,856 Nashville, TN660,424 Cincinnati, OH644,679 Selkirk, NY620,526 Walbridge, OH (Toledo)407,205 Fairburn, GA Intermodal Terminal (Atlanta)392,688 Louisville, KY336,211 Chicago 59th St. Intermodal Terminal313,870 CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.13CSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork Geography CSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors that are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These engineering attributes permit the corridor to support high-speed service across intermodal, automotive and merchandise commodities. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, intermodal and coal.Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia and provides access to major eastern ports.Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Southeast, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. The domestic coal market has declined significantly over the last decade and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility. CSXT’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Approximately one-quarter of export coal and the majority of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity or industrial purposes. See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network. Also included on the map, ""CSX Operating Agreement"" indicates areas within which CSX can operate through trackage rights beyond the CSX network.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.14CSX CORPORATIONPART ICSX Rail NetworkCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.15CSX CORPORATIONPART ILocomotivesAs of December 2021, CSXT owns or long-term leases more than 3,500 locomotives. From time to time, the Company also short-term leases locomotives based on business needs. Freight locomotives are used primarily to pull trains while switching locomotives are used in yards. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. Of owned locomotives, approximately 68% were in active service as of December 31, 2021, and the remainder were in storage to be utilized as needed. Storing locomotives and equipment allows the Company to quickly adjust its active fleet based on demand and other factors while avoiding delays due to supply limitations or excessive lead times to acquire additional equipment. As of December 2021, CSXT’s fleet of owned or long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following types: Locomotives%Average Age(years)Freight3,126 89 %22 Switching212 6 %43 Auxiliary units178 5 %29 Total locomotives3,516 100 %22 EquipmentThe Company owns or long-term leases rail equipment, including several types of freight cars and intermodal containers.

COVID-19 UpdateDemand for rail services has improved from steep declines in the first half of 2020, but the effects of the disruption of global manufacturing, supply chains and consumer spending as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic are ongoing. Future impacts of the pandemic on the Company’s financial and operating results will be determined by its duration, effects on the demand for the Company’s transportation services and the supply chain, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed and legislative stimulus packages passed in response to the pandemic. The duration of the pandemic is dependent on several factors, including the impacts of virus mutations and case resurgences across the country.CSX employees that provide efficient and reliable rail service are essential to keeping supply chains fluid in response to this challenge. Accordingly, business operations have been modified to ensure the safety of employees across the network while continuing to provide a high level of service to customers. The Company is strongly encouraging employees to get vaccinated. A cross-functional task force continues to monitor and coordinate the Company’s response to COVID-19.

Merchandise VolumeChemicals - Decreased due to lower shipments of crude oil and other energy-related commodities, partially offset by higher shipments of core chemicals and waste.Agricultural and Food Products - Increased as a result of higher shipments of vegetable oils, ethanol, and food and consumer products. Minerals - Increased as a result of higher shipments of cement, lime and limestone. Automotive - Decreased due to lower vehicle production at plants served by CSX, which were impacted by shortages of semiconductors and other parts.Forest Products - Increased primarily due to higher shipments of pulpboard, woodpulp and building products. Metals and Equipment - Increased as growth across the metals markets was partially offset by reduced equipment shipments. Fertilizers - Increased due to higher long-haul fertilizer shipments, partially offset by lower short-haul phosphate shipments.Intermodal VolumeIncreases in both domestic and international shipments resulted from strong demand, tight truck capacity, inventory replenishments and growth in rail volumes from east coast ports.Coal VolumeThe increase in export coal was driven by higher international shipments of both thermal coal and metallurgical coal. Domestic coal increased due to higher shipments of utility coal as well as higher steel and industrial shipments.Trucking RevenueTrucking revenue increased $410 million versus prior year due to the inclusion of Quality Carriers' results.Other Other revenue increased $336 million versus prior year due to increases in revenue for intermodal storage and equipment usage as well as higher affiliate and demurrage revenue. CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.27CSX CORPORATIONPART IIExpense In 2021, total expenses increased $707 million, or 11%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $275 million due to the following items:•Inflation and higher volume resulted in $133 million of increased expenses.•Incentive compensation increased $123 million primarily due to higher expected payouts in the current year, including accelerated expense for certain employees.•The acquisition of Quality Carriers resulted in increased costs of $61 million. •Other costs decreased $42 million primarily due to efficiency savings, lower severance expenses and other non-significant items, partially offset by expenses related to increased hiring and new retention programs of $38 million.Purchased Services and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services, purchased trucking and other transportation, and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total purchased services and other expenses increased $416 million driven by the following:•The inclusion of Quality Carriers' operations drove $257 million of additional costs.•Higher operating support costs, primarily due to an increased active locomotive fleet, as well as higher intermodal terminal costs drove an increase of $80 million.•All other costs increased $79 million primarily due to inflation and other non-significant costs, including $17 million in expenses related to the acquisition of Quality Carriers.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $37 million primarily due to a larger net asset base, which includes Quality Carriers' assets, partially offset by the impacts of the 2020 road and track depreciation study.Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $372 million primarily due to a 55% price increase in locomotive fuel prices and the inclusion of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking.Equipment and Other Rents expense includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers, tractors and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $26 million primarily due to increased car hire costs driven by higher days per load and the addition of Quality Carriers' costs, partially offset by other non-significant items.Gains on Property Dispositions increased to $454 million in 2021 from $35 million in 2020 primarily due to the conveyance of a permanent land easement to the Commonwealth of Virginia that resulted in a $349 million gain in April 2021 as well as other property dispositions throughout 2021.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.28CSX CORPORATIONPART IIInterest ExpenseInterest Expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and finance leases. Interest expense decreased $32 million as a result of lower average interest rates and a lower average debt balance.Other Income - NetOther Income - Net includes investment gains, losses and interest income, as well as components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. Other income increased $60 million primarily due to $48 million debt repurchase expense in the prior year and an increase in net pension benefit credits during 2021, partially offset by lower interest income.Income Tax ExpenseIncome Tax Expense increased $308 million primarily due to higher earnings before income taxes, partially offset by favorable state legislative changes and adjustments to deferred taxes as a result of filing of the 2020 state tax returns.Net Earnings and Earnings per Diluted ShareNet Earnings increased $1 billion to $3.8 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.48 to $1.68, due to the factors mentioned above. Average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.29CSX CORPORATIONPART II2020 vs. 2019 Results of Operations See below for discussion regarding operating expenses and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These discussion items have been updated to conform to the current presentation due to the reclassification of gains on property dispositions from the Purchased Services and Other caption to Gain on Property Dispositions, which had no impact on operating income, as well as the three-for-one stock split effective June 28, 2021. Expense In 2020, total expenses decreased $751 million, or 11%, compared to 2019. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $341 million due to the following items:•Efficiency and volume savings of $288 million primarily resulted from structural changes to the train plan that resulted in reduced crew starts as well as lower headcount.•Incentive compensation decreased $86 million primarily due to lower expected annual incentive payouts as well as higher prior year accelerated stock compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees.•Other costs increased $33 million primarily due to inflation and several other non-significant items, including severance costs.Purchased Services and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total purchased services and other expenses decreased $181 million driven by the following:•Efficiency and volume savings of $185 million primarily resulted from lower operating support costs, lower terminal costs as a result of record productivity levels at intermodal terminals, and reduced equipment maintenance expenses. •All other costs increased $4 million primarily due to inflation and other non-significant costs that were mostly offset by a $22 million non-railroad asset impairment in the prior year related to an intermodal terminal sale agreement.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $34 million primarily due to the impacts of the 2019 equipment depreciation study as well as a larger net asset base.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.30CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $365 million primarily due to a 31% price decrease that drove savings of $243 million, volume savings and a 5% improvement in fuel efficiency.Equipment and Other Rents expense includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers, tractors and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses decreased $14 million primarily due to volume savings, partially offset by higher days per load for automotive and other merchandise markets that resulted in increased car hire costs.Gains on Property Dispositions decreased to $35 million in 2020 from $151 million in 2019. Net Earnings and Earnings per Diluted ShareNet Earnings decreased $566 million to $2.8 billion, and earnings per diluted share decreased $0.19 to $1.20. Average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.31CSX CORPORATIONPART IINON-GAAP MEASURES (Unaudited) CSX reports its financial results in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.Free Cash Flow Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities, which includes proceeds from property dispositions. This measure should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow before dividends increased $1.2 billion year-over-year to $3.8 billion primarily due to higher net cash provided by operating activities and higher proceeds and advances from property dispositions, including $400 million of proceeds related to the conveyance of a permanent land easement to the Commonwealth of Virginia in 2021. These increases were partially offset by higher property additions. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (both non-GAAP measures).

Train velocity measures the profiled schedule of trains (from departure to arrival and all interim time), and train profiles are periodically updated to align with a changing operation.Dwell - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard.Cars Online - Average number of active freight rail cars on lines operated by CSX, excluding rail cars that are being repaired, in storage, those that have been sold, or private cars dwelling at a customer location more than one day. On-Time Originations - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.On-Time Arrivals - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to within two hours of scheduled arrival. Carload Trip Plan Performance - Percent of measured cars destined for a customer that arrive at or ahead of the original estimated time of arrival, notification or interchange (as applicable).Intermodal Trip Plan Performance - Percent of measured containers destined for a customer that arrive at or ahead of the original estimated time of arrival, notification or interchange (as applicable).Fuel Efficiency - Gallons of locomotive fuel per 1,000 gross ton-miles.Revenue Ton-Miles (RTM's) - The movement of one revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile.Gross Ton-Miles (GTM's) - The movement of one ton of train weight over one mile. GTM's are calculated by multiplying total train weight by distance the train moved. Total train weight is comprised of the weight of the freight cars and their contents. FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours. FRA Train Accident Rate - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.33CSX CORPORATIONPART II The Company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. Training and safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. Technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an additional layer of protection for the Company's employees. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance. Despite the operating challenges presented by global supply disruptions and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Company remained focused on safety, service, and controlling costs. Train velocity declined 11% relative to 2020. Dwell increased by 15% and cars online increased 17% in 2021. Compared to 2020, carload and intermodal trip plan performance decreased 10% and 3%, respectively. CSX expects network fluidity to improve commensurate with ongoing hiring efforts and a return to more normal supply chain conditions.From a safety perspective, the FRA personal injury index increased by 12% while the train-accident rate improved by 8% from the prior year. Safety remains a top priority at CSX, and the Company is committed to reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers and communities in which the Company operates. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its sources and uses of cash, balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed.Significant Cash Flows The following charts highlight the operating, investing and financing components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2021 and 2020. In 2021, the Company generated $5.1 billion of cash from by operating activities, which was $836 million higher than prior year primarily driven by higher cash-generating income and favorable working capital activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.9 billion, an increase in net spend of $1.2 billion from the prior year primarily as a result of decreased net sales of short-term investments and cash paid to acquire Quality Carriers, partially offset by higher proceeds and advances from property dispositions. Net cash used in financing activities was $4.1 billion, which represents an increase in net spend of $2.7 billion from the prior year primarily driven by higher share repurchases and lower proceeds from debt issuances, partially offset by lower debt repayments. CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.34CSX CORPORATIONPART IISources of Cash and Liquidity The Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. Simultaneous with the filing of this Form 10-K, the Company intends to file a new shelf registration statement, which may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. In 2021, CSX did not issue any new long-term debt. CSX has access to a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in March 2024. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. The Company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.Uses of Cash CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock, dividends to shareholders, acquisitions and other business opportunities, and contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan. In 2021, CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

Of the 2022 investment, over 80% is expected to be used to sustain the core infrastructure and operating equipment. The remaining amounts will be used to promote profitable growth, including projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations. CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.35CSX CORPORATIONPART IICSX is committed to returning cash to shareholders. Capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors. On February 16, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a 7% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.10 per common share effective March 2022. Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances.Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working Capital CSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases. Further, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $2.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $738 million from prior year end. The increase in total assets was primarily due to a net increase in property of $571 million attributable to capital expenditures and the consolidation of Quality Carrier's properties, the recognition of $393 million of goodwill and intangible assets related to the acquisition of Quality Carriers, a $236 million increase in accounts receivable commensurate with higher revenue and a $226 million increase in net assets for qualified pension plans primarily driven by favorable discount rates. These increases were partially offset by the $890 million decrease in cash described above. Total liabilities increased $348 million from year end primarily due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities of $215 million driven by accelerated tax depreciation, an increase in accounts payable of $154 million due to the timing of payments, an increase in labor and fringe benefit payable of $148 million partly due higher expected incentive compensation payouts, the assumption of $68 million in debt as a result of the acquisition of Quality Carriers, and an increase in income and other taxes payable of $61 million. These and other increases were offset by debt repayments of $426 million. Total shareholders' equity increased $390 million from year end primarily driven by net earnings of nearly $3.8 billion, mostly offset by share repurchases of $2.9 billion and dividends paid of $839 million. Working capital is considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $1.6 billion at December 2021 and $2.4 billion at December 2020, a decrease of $782 million. The decrease in current assets was primarily driven by the net decrease in cash described above, partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable. The increase in current liabilities was due to higher accounts payable and labor and fringe payable, partially offset by lower current maturities of long-term debt. The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.36CSX CORPORATIONPART IICompleted and Pending TransactionsAcquisition of Quality Carriers, Inc.On July 1, 2021, CSX acquired Quality Carriers, Inc. from Quality Distribution, Inc. for a purchase price of $544 million in cash, which is presented on the statement of cash flows net of $3 million cash acquired. This transaction was funded by cash on hand. For further details, refer to Note 17, Business Combinations. Proposed Acquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc.On November 30, 2020, CSX signed a definitive agreement to acquire Pan Am Systems, Inc. (“Pan Am”) which is the parent company of Pan Am Railways, Inc. who jointly owns Pan Am Southern, LLC with a subsidiary of Norfolk Southern Corporation. Pan Am owns and operates a highly integrated, nearly 1,200-mile rail network and has a joint interest in the more than 600-mile Pan Am Southern system. This acquisition, if approved, will expand CSX’s reach in the Northeastern United States. Assets and facilities to be acquired as part of the proposed transaction include road and track assets, work equipment, land, buildings and other assets. On February 25, 2021, the Company began the process of seeking approval from the STB. On January 13 and 14, 2022, the Company participated in a hearing before the STB to discuss the proposed transaction and a decision is expected by mid-April 2022. This proposed acquisition is not expected to be material with respect to the Company's financial statements when reviewed under the quantitative and qualitative considerations of Regulation S-X Article 11 and ASC 805, Business Combinations. Sale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of VirginiaOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-owned line segments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth”) over three phases for a total of $525 million. The timing and amount of gains recognized are based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of future conveyances and collectability. In April 2021, upon closing of the first phase of the agreement, the Company collected $200 million in proceeds and recognized a $349 million gain. In fourth quarter 2021, the Company collected additional proceeds of $200 million, a portion of which was attributable to the first phase with the remaining attributable to the second phase. There was no gain recognized in fourth quarter 2021 related to this agreement. As the second phase closed on January 10, 2022, the resulting $20 million gain will be recognized in first quarter 2022. The Company anticipates closing on the remaining conveyances by the end of 2022, which will result in future cash proceeds and gains. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying values of the remaining assets subject to this transaction were not material. CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.37CSX CORPORATIONPART IICredit Ratings Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings remained stable during 2021. As of December 2021 and December 2020, S&P's long-term rating on CSX was BBB+ (Stable), and Moody's was Baa1 (Stable). Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment-grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt. The Company is committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.Guaranteed Notes Issued By CSXTIn 2007, CSXT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX Corporation, issued in a registered public offering $381 million of secured equipment notes maturing in 2023. CSX Corporation has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes. At CSXT’s option, CSXT may redeem any or all of the notes, in whole or in part, at any time, at the redemption price including premium. In the case of loss or destruction of any item of equipment securing the notes, if CSXT does not substitute another item of equipment for the item suffering such loss or destruction, CSXT will be required to redeem the notes in part at par. The guarantee of the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of CSX Corporation and will be effectively subordinated to all future secured indebtedness of CSX Corporation to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. The guarantee is subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. As of December 31, 2021, the principal balance of these secured equipment notes was $149 million. In accordance with SEC rules, including amendments adopted in 2020, CSX is not required to present separate condensed consolidating financial information for wholly-owned subsidiaries who issued or guaranteed notes. Additionally, presentation of combined summary financial information regarding subsidiary issuers and guarantors is not required because the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined issuers and guarantors of the notes are not materially different from the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.38CSX CORPORATIONPART IICONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSContractual Obligations CSX is party to contractual arrangements that obligate the Company to make future cash payments. These obligations impact the Company’s liquidity and capital resource needs. The Company’s contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, purchase commitments, leases, other-post employment benefits and agreements with Conrail.•As of December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements, for additional information related to future debt payments. Future interest payments associated with outstanding debt total $13.5 billion, with $699 million payable in 2022.•Purchase commitments consist of CSX’s long-term locomotive maintenance program and other commitments to purchase technology, communications, railcar maintenance and other services. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about future payments related to purchase commitments.•The Company’s leases include property, equipment, and line leases. See Note 7, Leases, for additional information about future payments related to leases.•Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans that are unfunded. See Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans, for additional information about future payments under such plans.•Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. See Note 15, Investment in Affiliates and Related-Party Transactions, for additional information about future payments related to agreements with Conrail. Other Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOther commitments total $153 million and primarily consist of guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds, none of which are individually significant. These off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.39CSX CORPORATIONPART IILABOR AGREEMENTS Approximately 16,500 of the Company's over 20,900 employees are members of a labor union. For the 13 rail unions that participate in national bargaining, a round of negotiations for benefits, wages and work rules is underway. Typically, these negotiations take several years. Current agreements remain in place until modified by new agreements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:•personal injury and environmental reserves;•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting; •depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and•goodwill and other intangible assets.Personal Injury and Environmental ReservesPersonal Injury Personal Injury reserves of $118 million and $131 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, in the consolidated financial statements.Environmental Environmental reserves were $108 million and $76 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 220 environmentally impaired sites. The Company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:•type of clean-up required;•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.40CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued Conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, in the consolidated financial statements.Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired between 2003 and 2019, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. Beginning in 2020, the CSX Pension Plan was closed to new participants. As of December 2021, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $3.0 billion.In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Beginning in 2019, both the life insurance benefit for eligible active management employees and health savings account contributions made by the Company to eligible retirees younger than 65 were eliminated. Beginning in 2020, the employer-funded health reimbursement arrangements for eligible retirees 65 years or older were eliminated. As of December 2021, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s other post-retirement benefit plans was $81 million.For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;•long-term rate of return on plan assets;•salary scale inflation rates; and•other assumptions. The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. These amounts are reviewed by management.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.41CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedDiscount Rates Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments. The Company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and post-retirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity. The weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its 2021 pension and post-retirement obligations are 2.78% and 2.51%, respectively. For 2020, the weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations were 2.43% and 2.07%, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2021, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years, respectively. Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management, with the assistance of an outsourced investment manager, balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75% in both 2021 and 2020.Salary Scale Inflation Rates Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.60% in both 2021 and 2020 to value its pension obligations.Other Assumptions The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.42CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued2022 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense Net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2022 are expected to be credits of $42 million and $5 million, respectively. Net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2022 are expected to include service cost expense of $32 million and $1 million, respectively. Service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense are included in other income - net. Net periodic pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense in 2021 were credits of $17 million and $5 million, respectively. The net increase in the expected credit is primarily due to impacts from the increase in discount rates and recent favorable pension asset experience.The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a 1% change in certain assumptions like discount rates, long-term rate of return and salaries on the 2022 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:(Dollars in Millions)Pension ExpensePost-Retirement ExpenseDiscount Rate$20 $1 Long-term Rate of Return$28 N/ASalary Inflation$4 N/ADepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method The depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 86% of total fixed assets of $46.5 billion on a gross basis at December 31, 2021. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. Land is not depreciated. Management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;•evaluation of current operations;•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;•previous assessment of the condition of the assets; •management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.43CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued The STB requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) and every six years for road and track assets (e.g., bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). The Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2019, both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the Company's depreciation expense of $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A 1% change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $12 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. For additional details, including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies, see Note 6, Properties, in the consolidated financial statements.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsAs of December 2021, the Company had $451 million of Goodwill and Other Intangibles - Net. CSX recognized $213 million of goodwill and $180 million of intangible assets as a result of the Quality Carriers acquisition effective July 1, 2021. In applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, management must determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between depreciable and amortizable assets and goodwill. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital.CSX evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. In performing the qualitative impairment assessment, CSX considers relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, company-specific events, and legal and regulatory factors. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, the Company would perform a quantitative impairment test. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill or intangible asset exceeded the fair value under the quantitative test, an impairment loss would be recorded. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit could be based on one or more of the following fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure.New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption “New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy.”CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.44CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual performance or results could differ materially from those anticipated by any forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. If the Company does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be drawn that the Company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements. The following important factors, in addition to those discussed in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements: •legislative, regulatory or legal developments involving transportation, including rail or intermodal transportation, the environment, hazardous materials, taxation, international trade and initiatives to further regulate the rail industry;•the outcome of litigation, claims and other contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge, environmental matters, taxes, shipper and rate claims subject to adjudication, personal injuries and occupational illnesses;•changes in domestic or international economic, political or business conditions, including those affecting the transportation industry (such as the impact of industry competition, conditions, performance and consolidation, as well as the impact of international trade agreements and tariffs) and the level of demand for products carried by CSXT;CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.45CSX CORPORATIONPART II•natural events such as severe weather conditions, including floods, fire, hurricanes and earthquakes, a pandemic crisis affecting the health of the Company's employees, its shippers or the consumers of goods, or other unforeseen disruptions of the Company's operations, systems, property, equipment or supply chain;•competition from other modes of freight transportation, such as trucking, and competition and consolidation or financial distress within the transportation industry generally; •the cost of compliance with laws and regulations that differ from expectations as well as costs, penalties and operational and liquidity impacts associated with noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations;•the impact of increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas, including potential effects of high speed rail initiatives, or regulatory changes affecting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes;•unanticipated conditions in the financial markets that may affect timely access to capital markets and the cost of capital, as well as management's decisions regarding share repurchases; •changes in fuel prices, surcharges for fuel and the availability of fuel;•the impact of natural gas prices on coal-fired electricity generation;•the impact of global supply and price of seaborne coal on CSX's export coal market;•availability of insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or insufficient insurance coverage to cover claims or damages;•the inherent business risks associated with safety and security, including the transportation of hazardous materials or a cybersecurity attack which would threaten the availability and vulnerability of information technology;•adverse economic or operational effects from actual or threatened war or terrorist activities and any governmental response;•loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees;•labor and benefit costs and labor difficulties, including stoppages affecting either the Company's operations or customers' ability to deliver goods to the Company for shipment;•the Company's success in implementing its strategic, financial and operational initiatives, including acquisitions; •the impact of conditions in the real estate market on the Company's ability to sell assets;•changes in operating conditions and costs or commodity concentrations; •the continued and uncertain impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and•the inherent uncertainty associated with projecting economic and business conditions. Other important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified elsewhere in this report and in CSX's other SEC reports, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Company's website at www.csx.com. The information on the CSX website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.46CSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Changes in interest rates may impact the cost of future long-term debt issued by the Company, and as a result, represent interest rate risk to the Company. In an effort to manage this risk, CSX may use certain financial instruments such as interest rate forward contracts. The following information, together with information included in Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements, describes the key aspects of such contracts and the related market risk to CSX.Changes in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's forward starting interest rate swap. On both April 29, 2020, and July 9, 2020, the Company executed a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional value of $250 million for an aggregate notional value of $500 million. These swaps were effected to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with future interest payments related to the anticipated refinancing of notes due in 2027. The Company recognized an unrealized gain of $8 million and $62 million net of tax during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income with the related asset on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. Upon settlement of the swaps, which expire in 2027, the unrealized gain or loss in AOCI will be recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2021, the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be material. As of December 31, 2021, CSX has no floating rate debt obligations outstanding. However, changes in interest rates could impact the fair value (but not the carrying value) of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt. The potential decrease in fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in U.S. Treasury rates, or approximately 15 basis points, is estimated to be $448 million as of December 31, 2021 and $428 million as of December 31, 2020. The underlying fair values of the Company's long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.CSX 2021 Form 10-K p.47CSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 8.

Risk FactorsThe risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Regulatory, Legislative and LegalNew legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.Legislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs, including income taxes, and profitability of the Company's business. In addition, statutes or regulations imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs, adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. Noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.7CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates.Operational, Safety and Business DisruptionAn epidemic or pandemic and the initiatives to reduce its transmission could adversely affect the Company's business.The Company could be materially and adversely affected by a public health crisis, including a widespread epidemic or pandemic. During a health crisis, policies and initiatives may be instituted by the public and private sector to reduce transmission, such as closures of businesses and manufacturing facilities, the promotion of social distancing, the adoption of working from home by companies and institutions, and travel restrictions. These policies or initiatives could adversely affect demand for the commodities and products that the Company transports, including import and export volume. In addition, initiatives to reduce transmission could result in supply chain disruptions, which could impact volumes and make it more difficult for the Company to serve its customers. Moreover, operations are negatively affected when a significant number of employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. To the extent a public health crisis adversely affects the Company's business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The security, stability and availability of the Company’s and its key third-party vendors’ technology systems are critical to its ability to operate safely and effectively and to compete within the transportation industry. A successful data breach, cyber-attack, or the occurrence of any similar incident that impacts the Company’s or its key third-party vendors’ information technology systems could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), process failure, or other operational difficulties. A disruption or compromise of the Company’s information technology systems, even for short periods of time, and any resulting theft or compromise of Company confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), could adversely affect the Company’s business or reputation, create significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure and have a material adverse impact on CSX’s business, financial condition or operations.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.8CSX CORPORATIONPART IThe Company, its third-party vendors and other companies in the rail and transportation industries have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, data breaches, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents. These incidents may include, among other things, malware, ransomware, distributed denial of service attacks, social engineering, phishing, theft, malfeasance or improper access by employees or third-party vendors, human error, fraud, or other modes of attack or disruption. Attacks of these nature are increasing in frequency, levels of persistence, intensity and sophistication. Further, the Company may be at increased risk of a cyber-attack as a result of being a component of the critical U.S. infrastructure. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities, data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents. A public health crisis could also increase the risk that the Company or its third-party vendors may experience cybersecurity incidents as a result of employees, third-party vendors and other third parties with which they interact working remotely on less secure systems and environments.Despite the Company’s efforts to protect its information technology systems, it may not be able to prevent or anticipate all data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents, detect or react to such incidents in a timely manner or adequately remediate any such incident. While CSX’s security protocols have detected attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Company’s information technology systems, none of such attempts have resulted in any material breach of or disruption to the Company’s systems. For example, CSX has experienced distributed denial of service attacks that have resulted in brief system disruptions, but none have resulted in access to CSX systems. Additionally, despite routine security assessment of the Company’s key third-party vendors, some vendors have experienced cyber-attacks in the past, but none of such attacks have had a material adverse impact on CSX’s business or operations. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, CSX may be held responsible for data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents attributed to its third-party vendors as they relate to the information CSX shares with them.Additionally, if CSX is unable to acquire, develop or implement new technology, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service.Network or supply chain constraints could have a negative impact on service, operating efficiency or volume of shipments.CSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) locomotive or crew shortages; (ii) labor shortages or other service disruptions in the supply chain affecting trucking, ports, handling facilities, customer facilities or other railroads; (iii) unpredictable increases in demand; (iv) extreme weather conditions; (v) regulatory changes resulting in forced access or impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes; (vi) reductions in availability of pooled equipment, including chassis; (vii) impacts from changes in network capacity or structure; or (viii) increased passenger activities, which could impact CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.9CSX CORPORATIONPART IFurthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, hurricanes, fires and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Hurricanes as well as storm and flooding events have impacted the Company's network in the past, leading to interrupted service and damage to track and equipment. Changes in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions.Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.Competitive, Economic and FinancialThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers.The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.Global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, slower rates of economic growth in Asia, contraction of European economies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on U.S. export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for CSX. Additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products or continues to experience the impacts of inflation, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.10CSX CORPORATIONPART IChanging dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.Over time, changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets, including the impacts of regulation and alternative fuel sources, have resulted in lower energy production from coal-fired power plants in CSX's service territory. Changes in natural gas prices, or other factors impacting demand for electricity, could impact future power generation at coal-fired plants, which would affect the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.The Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.Availability of Critical Supplies and LaborThe unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and conductors, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company strives to maintain adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period. Disruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.The capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rail, ties, freight cars and locomotives) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are either bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee or locally between CSX and the union. Such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.11CSX CORPORATIONPART IClimate Change and EnvironmentalThe Company’s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change.There is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the Company's operational territory, which could impact the Company's network or other assets. Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles. Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations, including any proposed or implemented under the Biden administration, could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNoneCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.12CSX CORPORATIONPART IItem 2. PropertiesThe Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.Track and InfrastructureServing 26 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern markets of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.CSXT’s track structure includes mainline track, connecting terminals and yards, track within terminals and switching yards, sidings used for passing trains, track connecting CSXT's track to customer locations and turnouts that divert trains from one track to another. Total track miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads, are greater than CSXT’s approximately 20,000 route miles. At December 2022, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track MilesSingle Mainline Track19,879 Other Mainline Track5,662 Terminals and Switching Yards9,308 Passing Sidings and Turnouts901 Total35,750 In addition to its physical track structure, the Company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service. These serve as points of connectivity between the Company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers are received, classed for destination and placed onto outbound trains, or arrive and are delivered to the customer. The Company’s largest yards and terminals based on 2022 volume (number of railcars or intermodal containers processed) are listed below.Yards and TerminalsAnnual VolumeWaycross, GA931,488 Bedford Park Intermodal Terminal (Chicago)886,636 Selkirk, NY636,750 Nashville, TN627,868 Cincinnati, OH622,906 Avon, IN (Indianapolis)574,775 Walbridge, OH (Toledo)372,880 Fairburn, GA Intermodal Terminal (Atlanta)358,416 Louisville, KY352,029 Chicago 59th St. Intermodal Terminal308,421 CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.13CSX CORPORATIONPART INetwork GeographyCSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors that are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These engineering attributes permit the corridor to support high-speed service across intermodal, automotive and merchandise commodities. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries goods from all three of the Company’s major rail markets – merchandise, intermodal and coal.Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia and provides access to major eastern ports.Southeastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. Coal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Southeast, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. The domestic coal market has declined significantly over the last decade and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility. CSXT’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Most of the export coal the Company transports is used for steelmaking, while the majority of domestic coal the Company ships is used for electricity generation.See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network. Also included on the map, ""CSX Operating Agreement"" indicates areas within which CSX can operate through trackage rights beyond the CSX network.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.14CSX CORPORATIONPART ICSX Rail NetworkCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.15CSX CORPORATIONPART ILocomotivesAs of December 2022, CSXT owns or long-term leases more than 3,600 locomotives. From time to time, the Company also short-term leases locomotives based on business needs. Freight locomotives are used primarily to pull trains while switching locomotives are used in yards. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. Of owned locomotives, approximately 68% were in active service as of December 31, 2022, and the remainder were in storage to be utilized as needed. Storing locomotives and equipment allows the Company to quickly adjust its active fleet based on demand and other factors while avoiding delays due to supply limitations or excessive lead times to acquire additional equipment. As of December 2022, CSXT’s fleet of owned or long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following types: Locomotives%Average Age(years)Freight3,194 89 %23 Switching237 6 %45 Auxiliary Units177 5 %29 Total locomotives3,608 100 %25 EquipmentThe Company owns or long-term leases rail equipment, including several types of freight cars and intermodal containers.

Examples of these include railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service), multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared between railroads) and double-stack railcars, or well cars (which are industry pooled), that allow for two intermodal containers to be loaded one above the other. CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.16CSX CORPORATIONPART I The Company’s revenue-generating equipment, either owned or long-term leased, primarily consists of freight cars and containers as described below. Gondolas – Support CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.Multi-level flat cars – Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles.Covered hoppers – Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and industrial sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers.Open-top hoppers – Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions.Box cars – Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine.Flat cars – Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.Other cars – Primarily leased refrigerator cars and slab steel cars.Containers – Weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight, primarily in intermodal service.Item 3.

Agricultural and Food Products – Increased as a result of higher shipments of ethanol, sweeteners and vegetable oils, and grain.Automotive - Increased due to higher North American vehicle production as semiconductor availability has improved.Minerals - Increased due to higher shipments of aggregates driven by construction demand. Forest Products – Decreased due to lower shipments of pulpboard and building products.Metals and Equipment - Decreased primarily due to lower steel shipments, partially offset by higher scrap shipments and equipment moves. Fertilizers - Decreased due to declines in short-haul and long-haul phosphate shipments. Intermodal VolumeLower domestic shipments due to continued supply-side constraints, more subdued seasonal demand than prior year and a softening truck market were mostly offset by increased international shipments.Coal VolumeDomestic coal decreased due to lower shipments of utility coal, including the impacts of limited coal availability during mine disruptions during the year, as well as lower steel and industrial shipments. Export coal decreased due to lower shipments of thermal coal, partially driven by reduced capacity at Curtis Bay coal pier due to an outage at a portion of the facility. The facility is now back at full capacity.Trucking RevenueTrucking revenue increased $556 million versus prior year due to the inclusion of Quality Carriers’ results and higher fuel surcharge. Other RevenueOther revenue was $164 million higher than prior year driven by increases in revenue for intermodal storage and equipment usage, increases in demurrage and higher affiliate revenue. CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.26CSX CORPORATIONPART IIExpenseIn 2022, total expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 27%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $311 million due to the following items:•The impacts of agreements reached with labor unions as well as inflation totaled $199 million. Of the total, $32 million relates to labor and benefits in prior years.•The inclusion of Quality Carriers' operations for the full year in 2022 versus a portion of the year in 2021 resulted in increased costs of $74 million.•Incentive compensation costs decreased $29 million primarily due to the impact of accelerated expense for eligible employees in the prior year.•Other costs increased $67 million primarily due to hiring and retention costs, the inclusion of Pan Am's operations and other non-significant items.Purchased Services and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services, purchased trucking and other transportation, and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total purchased services and other expenses increased $550 million driven by the following:•The inclusion of Quality Carriers' operations for the full year in 2022 versus a portion of the year in 2021 drove $280 million of additional costs.•Higher operating support costs, primarily due to inflation, higher intermodal terminal costs and an increased active locomotive fleet, drove an increase of $182 million.•Adjustments to environmental reserves resulted in $21 million higher expense.•All other costs increased $67 million primarily due to several non-significant items including Pan Am's operations and acquisition-related costs. Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $713 million primarily due to a 66% price increase in locomotive fuel prices and the inclusion of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking.Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $80 million primarily due to a larger net asset base, which includes Quality Carriers' assets, as well as the impacts of a 2022 equipment depreciation study.Equipment and Other Rents expense includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers, tractors and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $32 million primarily due to increased car hire costs as well as the addition of Quality Carriers' costs. Car hire costs increased due to higher days per load and inflation, partially offset by lower volume.Gains on Property Dispositions decreased to $238 million in 2022 from $454 million in 2021 primarily due to lower gains from the sale of property rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia. Related to this transaction, CSX recognized gains of $144 million in 2022 and $349 million in 2021.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.27CSX CORPORATIONPART IIInterest ExpenseInterest Expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and finance leases. Interest expense increased $20 million primarily as a result of higher average debt balances, partially offset by increased capitalized interest.Other Income - NetOther Income - Net includes investment gains, losses and interest income, as well as components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. Other income increased $54 million primarily due to higher interest income, driven by increased rates, and an increase in net pension benefit credits during 2022.Income Tax ExpenseIncome Tax Expense increased $78 million primarily due to higher earnings before income taxes, partially offset by favorable adjustments to deferred state taxes and favorable state legislative changes.Net Earnings and Earnings per Diluted ShareNet Earnings increased $385 million to $4.2 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.27 to $1.95, due to the factors mentioned above. Average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.28CSX CORPORATIONPART IINON-GAAP MEASURES (Unaudited)CSX reports its financial results in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.Free Cash FlowManagement believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and proceeds from property dispositions. This measure should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow before dividends decreased $101 million year-over-year to $3.7 billion primarily due to higher property additions and lower proceeds and advances from property dispositions, mostly attributable to the sale of property rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia. These decreases were partially offset by higher net cash provided by operating activities.

These metrics will be updated to include the Pan Am network results as data becomes available.Key Performance Measures Definitions:Train Velocity - Average train speed between origin and destination in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains). Train velocity measures the profiled schedule of trains (from departure to arrival and all interim time), and train profiles are periodically updated to align with a changing operation.Dwell - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard.Cars Online - Average number of active freight rail cars on lines operated by CSX, excluding rail cars that are being repaired, in storage, those that have been sold, or private cars dwelling at a customer location more than one day. On-Time Originations - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.On-Time Arrivals - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to within two hours of scheduled arrival. Carload Trip Plan Performance - Percent of measured cars destined for a customer that arrive at or ahead of the original estimated time of arrival, notification or interchange (as applicable).Intermodal Trip Plan Performance - Percent of measured containers destined for a customer that arrive at or ahead of the original estimated time of arrival, notification or interchange (as applicable).Fuel Efficiency - Gallons of locomotive fuel per 1,000 gross ton-miles.Revenue Ton-Miles (RTM's) - The movement of one revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile.Gross Ton-Miles (GTM's) - The movement of one ton of train weight over one mile. GTM's are calculated by multiplying total train weight by distance the train moved. Total train weight is comprised of the weight of the freight cars and their contents. FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours. FRA Train Accident Rate - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.30CSX CORPORATIONPART IIThe Company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. Training and safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. Technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an additional layer of protection for the Company's employees. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.The Company remains focused on safety, service, and controlling costs. Train velocity declined 10% relative to 2021. Dwell increased by 6% and cars online increased 5% in 2022. Compared to 2021, intermodal trip plan performance improved 3%, while carload trip plan performance decreased 7%. CSX has seen an improvement in service metrics in the last quarter of 2022 and expects that trend to continue in 2023. From a safety perspective, the FRA personal injury index was flat compared to prior year while the train-accident rate improved by 1%. Safety remains a top priority at CSX, and the Company is committed to reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers and communities in which the Company operates. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its sources and uses of cash, balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed.Significant Cash FlowsThe following charts highlight the operating, investing and financing components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2022 and 2021. In 2022, the Company generated $5.6 billion of cash from operating activities, which was $520 million more than prior year primarily driven by higher cash-generating income, partially offset by less favorable working capital activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.1 billion, an increase in net spend of $254 million from the prior year primarily as a result of higher property additions and lower proceeds and advances from property dispositions, partially offset by decreased costs for business acquisitions. Cash used in financing activities was $3.8 billion, which represents a decrease in net spend of $343 million from the prior year mostly driven by the issuance of long-term debt as well as lower repayments of debt, partially offset by higher share repurchases.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.31CSX CORPORATIONPART IISources of Cash and LiquidityThe Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 16, 2022, which may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. In 2022, CSX issued $2.0 billion of long-term debt. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. CSX has access to a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in March 2024. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. The Company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.Uses of CashCSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock, dividends to shareholders, acquisitions and other business opportunities, and contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan. In 2022, CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

Of the 2023 investment, approximately 75% is expected to be used to sustain the core infrastructure and operating equipment. The remaining amounts will be used to promote profitable growth, including projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives. CSX intends to fund capital investments primarily through cash generated from operations.CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.32CSX CORPORATIONPART IICSX is committed to returning cash to shareholders. Capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors. On February 14, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a 10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.11 per common share effective March 2023. Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances.Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working CapitalCSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases. Further, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $1.4 billion from prior year end. The increase in total assets was primarily due to a $1.2 billion increase in net properties and a $193 million increase in investments in affiliates and other companies, partially offset by a reduction in cash of $281 million. The increase in net properties was primarily attributable to capital expenditures as well as fixed assets acquired as part of the Pan Am transaction. In addition, the increase in investments in affiliates and other companies includes the impact of the acquired interest in Pan Am Southern, LLC as well as higher values of several affiliates. See Note 17, Business Combinations, for more details on purchase accounting.Total liabilities increased $2.3 billion from prior year end primarily due to the issuance of $2.0 billion in long-term debt and a $186 million increase in deferred taxes due to accelerated tax depreciation and the impact of the Pan Am acquisition. These increases were partially offset by debt repayments of $186 million. Total shareholders' equity decreased $875 million from prior year end primarily driven by share repurchases of $4.7 billion and dividends paid of $852 million, partially offset by net earnings of $4.2 billion and $422 million of common stock issued to acquire Pan Am.Working capital is considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $1.4 billion at December 2022 and $1.6 billion at December 2021, a decrease of $262 million. Current assets decreased primarily driven by the net decline in cash of $281 million described above, partially offset by the $165 million increase in accounts receivable. Current liabilities increased primarily due to the $167 million increase in accounts payable.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.33CSX CORPORATIONPART IIThe Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. Completed TransactionsAcquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc.On June 1, 2022, CSX completed its acquisition of Pan Am. The closing price of $600 million was funded through a combination of common stock valued at $422 million and cash totaling $178 million, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. Total cash consideration paid to acquire the business includes a $30 million deposit paid in fourth quarter 2020. For further details, refer to Note 17, Business Combinations. Acquisition of Quality Carriers, Inc.On July 1, 2021, CSX acquired Quality Carriers, Inc. for a purchase price of $544 million in cash. This transaction was funded by cash on hand. For further details, refer to Note 17, Business Combinations. Sale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of VirginiaOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-owned line segments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth”) over three phases for a total of $525 million. As of December 31, 2022, all three phases are closed. Gains and proceeds in 2022 and 2021 related to this transaction are summarized in the following table. For further details, refer to Note 6, Properties.

The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings remained stable during 2022. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, S&P's long-term rating on CSX was BBB+ (Stable), and Moody's was Baa1 (Stable). Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment-grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt. The Company is committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.Guaranteed Notes Issued By CSXTIn 2007, CSXT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX Corporation, issued in a registered public offering $381 million of secured equipment notes maturing in 2023. CSX Corporation has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes. At CSXT’s option, CSXT may redeem any or all of the notes, in whole or in part, at any time, at the redemption price including premium. In the case of loss or destruction of any item of equipment securing the notes, if CSXT does not substitute another item of equipment for the item suffering such loss or destruction, CSXT will be required to redeem the notes in part at par. The guarantee of the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of CSX Corporation and will be effectively subordinated to all future secured indebtedness of CSX Corporation to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. The guarantee is subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. As of December 31, 2022, the principal balance of these secured equipment notes was $139 million. In accordance with SEC rules, including amendments adopted in 2020, CSX is not required to present separate condensed consolidating financial information for wholly-owned subsidiaries who issued or guaranteed notes. Additionally, presentation of combined summary financial information regarding subsidiary issuers and guarantors is not required because the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined issuers and guarantors of the notes are not materially different from the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.35CSX CORPORATIONPART IICONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSContractual Obligations CSX is party to contractual arrangements that obligate the Company to make future cash payments. These obligations impact the Company’s liquidity and capital resource needs. The Company’s contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, purchase commitments, leases, other-post employment benefits and agreements with Conrail.•As of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements, for additional information related to future debt payments. Future interest payments associated with outstanding debt total $14.8 billion, with $771 million payable in 2023.•Purchase commitments consist of CSX’s long-term locomotive maintenance program and other commitments to purchase technology, communications, railcar maintenance and other services. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about future payments related to purchase commitments.•Capital expenditures include investments related to public-private partnerships. These partnership investments are typically for projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through government awards or other funding sources. Project contribution commitments that are not reimbursable total $80 million as of December 31, 2022.•The Company’s leases include property, equipment, and line leases. See Note 7, Leases, for additional information about future payments related to leases.•Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans that are unfunded. See Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans, for additional information about future payments under such plans.•Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. See Note 15, Investment in Affiliates and Related-Party Transactions, for additional information about future payments related to agreements with Conrail. Other Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOther commitments total $178 million and primarily consist of guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds, none of which are individually significant. These off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.LABOR AGREEMENTSApproximately 17,100 of the Company's approximately 22,500 employees are members of a rail labor union. As of December 2, 2022, all 12 rail unions at CSX that participated in national bargaining were covered by national agreements with the Class I railroads and CSX-specific agreements that will remain in effect through December 31, 2024.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.36CSX CORPORATIONPART IICRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:•personal injury and environmental reserves;•pension plan accounting; •depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and•goodwill and other intangible assets.Personal Injury and Environmental ReservesPersonal InjuryPersonal Injury reserves of $126 million and $118 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, in the consolidated financial statements.EnvironmentalEnvironmental reserves were $161 million and $108 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 240 environmentally impaired sites. The Company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:•type of clean-up required;•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.37CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued Conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, in the consolidated financial statements.Pension Plan AccountingThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired between 2003 and 2019, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. Beginning in 2020, the CSX Pension Plan was closed to new participants. As of December 2022, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $2.4 billion. For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension plans, see Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans.The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;•long-term rate of return on plan assets; and•other assumptions.The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. These amounts are reviewed by management.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.38CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continuedDiscount RatesDiscount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.The Company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity. The weighted average discount rate used by the Company to value its pension obligations was 5.02% and 2.78% as of December 2022, and December 2021, respectively. As of December 2022, the estimated duration of pension benefits is approximately 10 years.Each year, the discount rate is reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rate will change.Long-term Rate of Return on Plan AssetsThe expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management, with the assistance of an outsourced investment manager, balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75% in both 2022 and 2021.Other AssumptionsThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover, retirement age and salary inflation rates. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.39CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued2023 Estimated Pension ExpenseNet periodic pension benefit expense for 2023 is expected to be a credit of $1 million. Net periodic pension benefit expense for 2023 is expected to include service cost expense of $24 million. Service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense are included in other income - net. Net periodic pension expense in 2022 was a credit of $41 million. The net decrease in the expected credit is primarily due to impacts from recent unfavorable pension asset experience, partially offset by the increase in discount rates.The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a 1% change in certain assumptions on the 2023 estimated pension expense:(Dollars in Millions)Pension ExpenseDiscount Rate$16 Long-term Rate of Return$24 Depreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life MethodThe depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 84% of total fixed assets of $48.1 billion on a gross basis at December 31, 2022. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. Land is not depreciated. Management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;•evaluation of current operations;•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;•previous assessment of the condition of the assets; •management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.40CSX CORPORATIONPART IICritical Accounting Estimates, continued The STB requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) and every six years for road and track assets (e.g., bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). The Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2022, both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. The 2022 equipment study resulted in an expected increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $80 million primarily due to deferred losses on assets depreciated using the group-life method. Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the Company's depreciation expense of $1.4 billion in both 2021 and 2020.A 1% change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $12 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. There were no significant changes to the company's asset lives as a result of the 2022 and 2020 studies. For additional details, including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies, see Note 6, Properties, in the consolidated financial statements.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsAs of December 2022, the Company had $502 million of Goodwill and Other Intangibles - Net. In applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, management must determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between depreciable and amortizable assets and goodwill. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital.CSX evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. In performing the qualitative impairment assessment, CSX considers relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, company-specific events, and legal and regulatory factors. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, the Company would perform a quantitative impairment test. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill or intangible asset exceeded the fair value under the quantitative test, an impairment loss would be recorded. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit could be based on one or more of the following fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure.New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption “New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy.”CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.41CSX CORPORATIONPART IIFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Changes in interest rates may impact the cost of future long-term debt issued by the Company, and as a result, represent interest rate risk to the Company. In an effort to manage this risk, CSX may use certain financial instruments such as interest rate forward contracts. The following information, together with information included in Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements, describes the key aspects of such contracts and the related market risk to CSX.Changes in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's forward starting interest rate swap. In 2020, the Company executed two forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of $250 million for an aggregate notional value of $500 million. These swaps were effected to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with future interest payments related to the anticipated refinancing of notes due in 2027. The Company recognized an unrealized gain of $80 million and $8 million net of tax during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income with the related asset on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In fourth quarter 2022, CSX settled a portion equal to $160 million notional value of the aggregate $500 million cash flow hedges, which resulted in CSX receiving a cash payment of $52 million. The gain associated with the settled portion of the hedges will continue to be classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) until the associated debt instrument is issued in the future. Upon final settlement of the swaps, which expire in 2027, the unrealized gain or loss in AOCI will be recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2022, the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be material. Changes in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps. In 2022, CSX entered into five separate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps classified as fair value hedges. The swaps are designed to hedge 10 years of interest rate risk associated with market fluctuations attributable to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate on a cumulative $800 million of fixed rate outstanding notes, which are due between 2036 and 2040. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative fair value of these swaps was a $118 million liability, which is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The associated cumulative adjustment to the hedged notes is included in long-term debt. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt with no gain or loss recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. The difference in the net fixed-to-float interest settlement on the derivatives is recognized in interest expense and was not material for the year ending at December 31, 2022. The swaps will expire in 2032. If settled early, the remaining liability or asset will be amortized over the remaining life of the associated notes. As of December 31, 2022, the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be material. As of December 31, 2022, CSX has no floating rate notes outstanding. However, changes in interest rates could impact the fair value (but not the carrying value) of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt. The potential decrease in fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in U.S. Treasury rates, or approximately 40 basis points, is estimated to be $709 million as of December 31, 2022, and $448 million as of December 31, 2021. The underlying fair values of the Company's long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.CSX 2022 Form 10-K p.44CSX CORPORATIONPART IIItem 8.

277948,CSX,CSX CORP,2004,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General CSX Corporation (“CSX” or the “Company”) operates one of the largest rail networks in the United States and also arranges for and provides integrated rail and truck (“intermodal”) transportation services across the United States and key markets in Canada and Mexico. Surface Transportation, which includes CSX’s rail and intermodal units, generated revenue of $7.4 billion in 2003 compared to $7.2 billion in 2002. Operating income for Surface Transportation was $651 million in 2003 compared to $995 million in 2002. CSX’s marine operations include an international terminal services company, which operates and develops container terminals, 9 distribution facilities and related terminal activities. In February 2003, CSX conveyed most of its interest in its domestic container-shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines, to a new venture formed with the Carlyle Group. CSX also owns and operates the Greenbrier, a AAA Five-Diamond resort located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. In 2003, revenue and volume grew in response to strategies to persuade new customers to ship via a combination of rail and truck, the introduction of new customer services, and the economic recovery. However, as discussed below increased costs and operating inefficiency in the rail network decreased CSX’s overall profitability. Surface Transportation CSX’s rail system is a network, defined by its more than 23,000 route miles, through which goods and services flow. The inefficiency of any one element in that network can have an effect on other components, and ultimately affect the operating efficiency of the entire network. The decline in CSX’s operating efficiency, coupled with the increased price of fuel and other higher costs, reduced CSX’s profit in 2003. In addition to reviewing various financial measures, CSX management uses non-financial indicators to monitor performance and operating efficiency of its network. Those include: % Improvement Key Non-Financial Performance Indicators 2003 2002 (Decline) Personal Injury Frequency Index (Per 100 Employees) 2.20 1.98 (11 )% FRA Train Accidents Frequency (Per Million Train Miles) 4.37 3.34 (31 ) Average Velocity, All Trains (Miles Per Hour) 21.1 22.5 (6 ) Average System Dwell Time (Hours) 25.3 23.2 (9 ) Average Total Cars-On-Line 229,926 229,609 — On-Time Originations 62.0 % 76.4 % (19 ) On-Time Arrivals 56.9 % 76.9 % (26 ) Average Recrews (Per Day) 50 26 (92 )% The decline in these non-financial performance measures contributed to higher operating expenses and resulted in a higher operating ratio for Surface Transportation, which increased to 91.2% in 2003 from 86.1% in 2002. The number of injuries per 100 employees increased by 11%, while the number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train miles showed a 31% increase from 2002 to 2003. Average train velocity, which is a measure of efficiency, decreased 6% from 22.5 miles per hour in 2002 to 21.1 miles per hour in 2003. The average system dwell time, which measures the amount of time between car arrival and departure from yards, increased 9% from 2002 to 2003. The percent of scheduled trains departing the origin station at or prior to the scheduled departure time and the percent of scheduled trains arriving at the destination station within two hours of the scheduled arrival time both showed year-over-year declines. The number of relief crews called per day on average, which is an indicator of efficiency in the use of crews, showed the largest percent decline, increasing from 26 to 50. CSX management is taking steps to identify the source of operating inefficiencies and reduce operating expenses. Management also is evaluating ways to restore the network operating efficiency, while maintaining volume. This includes reducing both gross ton-miles and the number of times a railcar is handled, or switched, en route to its final destination. Because American industry has changed significantly in recent years. Management believes there are portions of CSX’s non-core network that could be more efficiently used by third parties. The Company is currently evaluating the lease or sale of up to 3,000 miles of its non-core network. This would allow CSX to return approximately 50 locomotives to the core network, reduce capital outlays and decrease operating expenses. 10 These changes will allow for and require organizational improvements. CSX is undertaking a major management restructuring that began in November 2003 and is expected to conclude near the end of the first quarter of 2004. Management believes that the conveyance of CSX Lines in February of 2003 and the resolution of the disputes with Maersk relating to the 1999 sale of the international container shipping assets will allow management to focus on its core surface transportation segment. International Terminals CSX World Terminals’ (“CSXWT”) Hong Kong terminal accounted for approximately 67% of CSXWT’s revenues and 62% of operating income in 2003. The Hong Kong terminal showed a year-over-year volume decrease of 7.2%, which corresponded with a 5.8% decrease in revenue versus 2002. Competitive pressures are rising as customers are shifting their traffic from facilities in Hong Kong to newly opened terminals in South China’s Guangdong region. This shift will also translate into reduced volumes and revenue. A significant customer of CSXWT announced that it would terminate its marine terminal services contract during the first quarter of 2004. This is expected to negatively impact CSXWT’s 2004 operating income by approximately $29 million and cash flow by approximately $21 million. In December 2004, another contract is scheduled to expire. Negotiations are in process to maintain this contract, but if negotiations are unsuccessful, 2005 operating income may be negatively impacted by $20 million. CSXWT expects that it will be able to replace all or substantially all of the lost volume with new customers representing long and short-term commercial commitments. However, due to the increased competitive pressures, it is possible that the profit margins achieved in the past will not be realized in the near term. Recognizing its need to diversify beyond the Hong Kong terminal, CSXWT has been expanding its capacity and market reach. During 2003, CSX’s minority owned terminal operation located in the Shandong Province of the People’s Republic of China commenced operations. CSXWT has also completed the first phase of its terminal construction in Caucedo, which is located in the Dominican Republic. The Caucedo terminal company is an unconsolidated entity of CSXWT that began operations in December 2003. In response to competition in the South China Guangdong region, CSXWT has initiatives in process to maintain and improve its productivity standards. In addition to volume, CSXWT monitors terminal productivity or lifts per hour. For the years ended December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, lifts per hour for some of the main terminals was as follows: Lifts Per Hour Port’s % of CSXWT % Improvement Terminal Operating Income 2003 2002 (Decline) Hong Kong, China 62 % 40.4 39.1 3 % Adelaide, Australia 5 % 22.3 21.6 3 % Germershiem, Germany 5 % 23.7 25.2 (6 )% Rio Haina, Dominican Republic 5 % 25.8 26.1 (1 )% Overall, terminal productivity remained relatively stable in 2003 compared to 2002. Financial Results of Operations Consolidated Results CSX follows a 52/53-week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal years 2003 and 2002 consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, respectively. 11 2003 vs. 2002 Operating Revenue Operating revenue decreased $359 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 to $7.8 billion, compared to $8.2 billion for the prior year. A $627 million decline in consolidated revenue resulted from a reduction of revenue in the domestic container-shipping segment as a majority of CSX’s interest in CSX Lines was conveyed during the first quarter of 2003 (See Note 3, Divestitures). Excluding revenue from this conveyance, revenue increased $268 million primarily due to an increase in Surface Transportation revenue. Operating Income Operating income for the year ended December 26, 2003 was down $501 million to $626 million, compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year. The prior year included $38 million of operating income of CSX Lines, which was conveyed to a new venture formed with the Carlyle Group in the first quarter of 2003. Excluding operating income from this conveyance, 2003 operating income decreased $463 million. The decrease in operating income is primarily the result of two charges taken during 2003 totaling $340 million. The Company recorded a $232 million charge in conjunction with the change in estimate for casualty reserves, which is reflected in operating expense as “Provision for Casualty Claims” (See Note 10, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves). Also, CSX entered into two settlement agreements, which together resolve all material outstanding disputes with Maersk. This decreased the Company’s operating income by $108 million, and is reflected in operating expense as the additional loss on sale of international container-shipping assets (See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies). The Company also recorded $34 million pretax as the initial charge for separation expenses related to the management restructuring announced in November 2003. In addition, the Company recorded a credit of $22 million pretax related to revised estimates for railroad retirement taxes and the amount of benefits that will ultimately be paid to individuals under the $1.3 billion charges for separation plans initially recorded in 1991 and 1992. For the year, the Company has recorded a net restructuring charge of $22 million that includes these items and additional separation charges that were included in the third quarter results. (See Note 4, Restructuring). Materials, supplies and other expenses decreased $62 million, or 4%, year-over-year, as a result of the conveyance of most of the Company’s interest in its domestic container-shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines. Excluding the $244 million of expenses of CSX Lines, materials, supplies and other increased $193 million year-over-year. Approximately $80 million of this increase relates to increased costs for personal injuries and safety issues. An additional $20 million of the expense deterioration is due to increased cost of derailments. The remaining increase results from volume increases, inflationary effects and general operational inefficiencies, as reflected by the decline in the non-financial performance indicators. Fuel expense for Surface Transportation operations increased $117 million in 2003, as compared to the prior year. The expense increase is primarily due to $102 million in fuel price increases, while increased volumes were also a factor. The average price per gallon of fuel was 96 cents per gallon for 2003 compared to 78 cents per gallon for 2002. In order to minimize future exposure to fuel price fluctuation risk, during 2003 the Company entered into a series of swaps in order to fix the price on a portion of its estimated future fuel purchases. As of December 26, 2003, 18% and 21% of 2004 and 2005, respectively, estimated fuel purchases were hedged. Fuel swaps did not have an effect on fuel expense for the year ended December 26, 2003. 12 Favorably impacting expense was the absence of a management bonus at its Surface Transportation companies in 2003, as approximately $45 million of such expense was recorded in 2002. Other Income Other income increased $16 million to $57 million for the year ended December 26, 2003, compared to $41 million for the prior year. A decrease in discounts on sales of accounts receivable due to the discontinuance of this program and a loss on sale in 2002 that did not recur in 2003 had a favorable impact, but were partially offset by lower interest income and reduced real estate gains. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $27 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 as compared to the prior year. Lower interest rates on floating rate debt and the favorable impact of interest rate swaps (see Note 12, Derivative Financial Instruments) continued to benefit the Company. Net Earnings Net earnings were $246 million, or $1.14 per share, for the year ended December 26, 2003, compared to $424 million, or $1.99 per share for the prior year. The year ended December 26, 2003 included an after-tax cumulative effect of accounting change benefit of $57 million, 26 cents per share, related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” while the year ended December 27, 2002 included an after-tax cumulative effect of accounting change charge of $43 million, 20 cents per share, related to the adoption of SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting changes were $189 million and $467 million for the years ended December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, respectively. The $278 million year-over-year decrease in net earnings primarily results from a $145 million after-tax charge to increase the Company’s provision for casualty reserves, a $67 million after-tax charge to record the loss on sale of international container-shipping assets and a $21 million after-tax charge to record amounts associated with the management restructuring. The remaining decrease results from the decline in operating income as discussed above, somewhat offset by the favorable impact of decreased interest expenses and income taxes. 2002 vs. 2001 Operating Revenue Fiscal year 2001 consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 28, 2001. Operating revenue of $8.2 billion in 2002 was slightly higher than 2001, resulting mainly from an increase in revenues at the Company’s domestic container-shipping unit, CSX Lines, which offset a small decrease at the Company’s Surface Transportation units. Operating Income Operating expense of $7.0 billion in 2002 was 2% lower due mainly to lower fuel and labor costs at the Company’s Surface Transportation business. The effect on 2001 of the $60 million New Orleans litigation settlement contributed to the favorable year-to-year comparison. 13 Other Income Other income was up $32 million in 2002 as compared to 2001, due mainly to reduced losses relating to equity investments and other favorable miscellaneous items, offset by lower interest income. Interest Expense Interest expense was reduced by $73 million in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to refinancing fixed-rate maturities at lower interest rates, and to a greater percentage of outstanding debt during 2002 bearing a floating rate of interest through the use of interest rate swap agreements. Net Earnings The Company reported net earnings for 2002 of $424 million, $1.99 per share, compared to $293 million, $1.38 per share in 2001. Results for 2002 include the write-down of indefinite lived intangible assets as a cumulative effect of accounting change, which reduced net earnings $43 million after tax. Results for 2001 include a provision to account for the settlement of the New Orleans tank car fire litigation, which reduced net earnings by $37 million after tax. Excluding the cumulative effect of the accounting change and the New Orleans litigation provision, net earnings were $467 million for 2002, compared with $330 million for 2001. This increase is the result of increased operating income on a consolidated basis of $110 million (excluding the pretax charge of $60 million in 2001 for the New Orleans litigation provision), higher other income of $32 million and lower interest expense of $73 million.

Surface Transportation Results The following tables provide Surface Transportation carload and revenue data by service group and commodity: Fiscal Years Ended December 26, 2003, December 27, 2002 and December 28, 2001 Carloads Revenue 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 (Thousands) (Dollars in Millions) Merchandise Phosphates and Fertilizer 460 463 441 $ 329 $ 324 $ 306 Metals 348 319 320 435 401 395 Forest and Industrial 604 590 596 806 771 777 Agricultural and Food 457 452 467 660 648 661 Chemicals 544 542 540 993 964 937 Emerging Markets 476 424 435 471 398 384 Total Merchandise 2,889 2,790 2,799 3,694 3,506 3,460 Automotive 529 538 516 853 845 794 Coal, Coke and Iron Ore Coal 1,570 1,574 1,722 1,543 1,529 1,671 Coke and Iron Ore 65 70 77 57 69 68 Total Coal, Coke and Iron Ore 1,635 1,644 1,799 1,600 1,598 1,739 Other — — — 35 54 89 Total Rail 5,053 4,972 5,114 6,182 6,003 6,082 Intermodal Domestic 1,060 982 901 784 696 625 International 1,170 1,137 1,103 469 476 470 Other — — — 4 8 17 Total Intermodal 2,230 2,119 2,004 1,257 1,180 1,112 Total Surface Transportation 7,283 7,091 7,118 $ 7,439 $ 7,183 $ 7,194 16 Rail 2003 vs. 2002 Operating Revenue CSX categorizes rail revenues in three main areas: 1. Merchandise, which includes the following markets: • Phosphates and Fertilizers • Metals • Forest and Industrial • Agricultural and Food • Chemicals • Emerging Markets 2. Automotive 3. Coal, Coke and Iron Ore Merchandise Revenue Merchandise showed strength during 2003 with revenue up 5% on 4% volume growth. All markets showed year-over-year revenue improvement, and all except phosphates and fertilizers experienced increased volumes. Emerging markets realized the most improvement, with 18% revenue growth on 12% volume growth. Aggregates and cement traffic grew faster than average industry growth rates due to new industrial development and increased conversion of truck traffic to rail. Ammunition volumes increased throughout the year and strength continued in waste markets. The metals sector also showed strength in 2003. Revenue improved 8% on 9% volume growth, driven by strong global steel demand, particularly for scrap and sheet steel. Other factors contributing to improvement include strength in semi-finish metals and continued increases in modal conversions. Demand for building products, lumber and paper products resulted in an increase in forest and industrial revenue of 5% on 2% volume growth. The agricultural and food and chemical sectors also realized revenue increases, while volumes remained consistent with 2002. Phosphates and fertilizers revenues increased slightly year-over-year despite decreased volume, due to domestic phosphates and ammonia strength. Automotive Revenue Volume declined largely due to a 200,000 unit year-over-year decrease in North American light vehicle production. Haul extensions and price increases drove improvements in revenue per car. Coal, Coke and Iron Ore Revenue Coal, coke and iron ore volumes and revenue remained consistent with results in the prior year. Export moves were strong due to high European steam coal demand for electricity generation. Steel related traffic was weak throughout the year, but showed renewed strength during the fourth quarter due to consolidation in the steel industry and shifts in scrap metal demands that resulted in increased traffic and revenue for CSX. Utility revenue was favorable due to pricing initiatives and higher average length of haul. Improvements in these areas were offset by abnormally harsh winter weather during the first quarter which adversely affected lake loadings, as lakes were frozen. 17 Operating Expense Total rail operating expenses increased $492 million, or 10% in 2003 as compared to 2002. Increases in most expense categories were somewhat offset by decreases in building and equipment rent. The primary component of the expense increase was a charge of $229 million recorded in conjunction with the Company’s change in estimate for its casualty reserves to include an estimate of incurred but not reported claims for asbestos and other occupational injuries that could be received over the next seven years. This charge is reflected as “Provision for Casualty Claims” in the financial statements. (See Note 10, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves.) Labor and fringe expense remained relatively consistent year-over-year. The cost of labor inflation was offset by December-over-December reductions in staff of approximately 1,200 and the favorable impact of the absence of a management bonus in 2003, as approximately $45 million of such expense was recorded in 2002. Materials, supplies and other expenses increased $117 million, or 10%, year-over-year. One of the primary drivers was approximately $80 million of increased cost for personal injury and related safety issues. An additional $20 million of the expense deterioration is due to increased cost of derailments. Additionally, due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” as discussed below, depreciation expense has been decreased and materials, supplies and other increased to account for the discontinuation of the accrual of cross-tie removal as a component of depreciation expense. The remaining increase results from volume increases, inflationary effects and general operational inefficiencies. Conrail rents, fees & services expense increased $20 million in 2003, as compared to the prior year, as a result of increased usage of Shared Asset Areas, a contractual increase in the rental fee for Shared Area facilities, and a favorable tax adjustment in the prior year. (See Note 2, Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations With Conrail.) Building and equipment rent decreased $7 million in 2003 compared to the prior year principally as a result of reduced car rentals from other railroads. Inland transportation, which represents CSXI’s use of the CSXT rail networks, remained relatively consistent year-over-year. The offsetting expense associated with this amount is reflected in CSXI’s operating expense, and thus eliminates on a Surface Transportation level. Depreciation remained consistent year-over-year. The rail segment had capital additions of approximately $1 billion, but the additional depreciation was offset by the reduction in depreciation associated with the adoption of SFAS 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” In conjunction with the group-life method of accounting for asset costs, the Company historically accrued crosstie removal costs as a component of depreciation, which is not permitted under SFAS 143. The effect is to decrease depreciation expense and increase material, supplies and other expense. Fuel expense increased $117 million in 2003, as compared to the prior year. The expense increase is primarily due to $102 million in fuel price increases, while increased volumes were also a factor. The average price per gallon of fuel was 96 cents per gallon for 2003 compared to 78 cents per gallon for 2002. In order to minimize future exposure to fuel price fluctuation risk, during 2003 the Company entered into a series of swaps in order to fix the price of a portion of its estimated future fuel purchases. As of December 26, 2003, 18% and 21% of 2004 and 2005, respectively, estimated fuel purchases were hedged. Fuel swaps did not have an effect on fuel expense for the year ended December 26, 2003. The net $22 million restructuring charge in 2003 represents the cost of CSX’s reorganization charges offset by reductions in 1991/1992 separation reserves. (See Note 4, Restructuring.) 18 Operating Income Operating income decreased $313 million to $541 million in 2003, compared to $854 million in 2002 primarily due to the $229 million provision for casualty claims, the $22 million net restructuring charge and other expense increases as previously discussed. Excluding the provision for casualty claims and net restructuring charge, operating income would have been $792 million. 2002 vs. 2001 Operating Revenue Overall rail revenues were down $79 million to $6.0 billion in 2002, with increases in merchandise and automotive revenues being offset by lower coal revenues. CSX’s pricing programs and product mix helped overcome a 3% decrease in carloads in 2002. Merchandise Revenue Overall merchandise revenues were up 1%, or $47 million in 2002 over 2001. Improvements in phosphates and fertilizers, chemicals, emerging markets, metals and paper and forest products more than offset decreases in minerals, agricultural products and food and consumer products. Pricing programs and favorable mix helped the Company offset the effect of a small decrease in merchandise carloads in 2002 as compared to 2001. Automotive Revenue Automotive revenues improved 6%, or $51 million in 2002 as a result of yield improvement driven by favorable mix and extended linehauls. Year-over-year volume increases were driven by higher light truck production levels and aggressive manufacturer incentives that stimulated automobile sales during 2002. Coal, Coke and Iron Ore Revenue Coal revenues had a significant impact on the rail segment’s 2002 financial results. Coal revenue was down 9%, or $143 million from 2001’s strong performance due to reduced volumes. Export carloads were down significantly as a result of the reduced competitive standing of U.S. coal in the international market, while metallurgical and industrial markets were down in the second half of 2002. Other Revenue Other revenue decreased $35 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 primarily because there were lower fuel surcharges billed to customers. Operating Expense Total rail operating expenses decreased $190 million, or 4% in 2002 as compared to 2001. Reductions in most expense categories were somewhat offset by increases in depreciation and reduced intercompany volume with CSX Intermodal. Also, 2001 included $60 million relating to the New Orleans litigation settlement. Fuel costs decreased $76 million in 2002, of which $69 million is attributable to lower fuel prices. The net impact on operating income of reduced fuel price was $44 million since $25 million of fuel surcharge revenue was discontinued. Labor and fringe costs decreased $44 million year-over-year including savings from reductions in overall employment. These savings were offset by increased labor costs relating to cost of living wage increases. Employee count was approximately 950 lower at the end of 2002 as compared to 2001. 19 Building and equipment costs were down $17 million mainly due to continued reduction in car hire as the railroad took cars offline and ran more efficiently. Conrail operating fees, rents and services decreased $14 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. Decreased costs in operating the shared asset areas, tax settlements, efficiency improvements and adjustments to reflect lower reserve requirements for car hire, overcharges, interline and other claims all reduced this expense. Materials, supplies and other costs at the rail unit were down $11 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, due to reduced transportation costs, fewer accidents and adjustments to estimated state and local tax liabilities to reflect actual assessments. These decreases were offset by higher legal fees and maintenance costs, and $40 million in favorable insurance settlements received in 2001 that were not repeated in 2002. Depreciation expense increased $26 million as compared to 2001, as a result of a higher depreciable asset base. Operating Income Rail operating income increased by $111 million to $854 million in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to operating expense decreases noted previously and the New Orleans litigation provision. Excluding the 2001 charge for the New Orleans litigation provision, operating income was up $51 million or 6% for the year. Intermodal 2003 vs. 2002 CSX Intermodal domestic revenue improved 13% on 8% volume increase due to increased unloading and loading (“transloading”) of international containers into domestic containers and new programs. Strength in truck brokerage continued due to the rollout of the new Pegasus information management system, which provides real-time information regarding driver availability and location, service quality tracking and financial performance. The parcel sector also showed year-over-year strength. International strength in general import growth was partially offset by continued international import/export diversions of freight carried entirely via water routes from west coast ports to east coast ports. These diversions have resulted in volume declines, shorter hauls and lower per-unit revenue. Intermodal operating expense increased $108 million compared to the prior year. The increase is due primarily to traffic mix and inflationary factors. Additionally, the Company recognized a $15 million positive contract settlement in 2002. Operating income decreased to $110 million in 2003, compared to $141 million in the prior year. 2002 vs. 2001 CSXI reported operating revenue of $1.2 billion in 2002, as compared to $1.1 billion in 2001. The increase was primarily due to continued success in efforts to convert truck traffic onto the intermodal network. CSXI operating expense increased $31 million in 2002. This increase was the result of $32 million in higher inland transportation costs due to increased volumes handled during 2002. Also, due to volume increases, building and equipment rent increased $8 million, and materials, supplies and other increased $6 million. The increase was partially offset by a $15 million positive contract settlement. Other costs were relatively flat year-over-year. CSXI operating income was up $37 million in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to the $68 million increase in revenues, offset by a $31 million increase in operating expenses. These results were also impacted by the $15 million positive contract settlement noted above. 20 International Terminals 2003 vs. 2002 CSXWT’s revenue decreased $10 million, or 4% to $226 million for 2003, compared to $236 million in the prior year, primarily due to weakness in the Hong Kong market. Expense decreased to $157 million for the year, compared to $167 million for 2002, partially attributable to reduced labor and fringe costs associated with reduced volume at its Hong Kong operations and a $6 million gain related to the divestiture of a portion of the Caucedo terminal ownership interest, which offset other miscellaneous expenses in 2002. Operating income remained consistent at $69 million in 2003 and 2002. During 2003, a significant customer of CSXWT announced that it would terminate its marine terminal services contract during the first quarter of 2004. This is expected to negatively impact CSXWT’s 2004 operating income by approximately $29 million and cash flow by approximately $21 million. In December 2004, another contract is scheduled to expire. Negotiations are in process to maintain this contract, but if negotiations are unsuccessful, 2005 operating income may be negatively impacted by $20 million. CSXWT expects that it will be able to replace all or substantially all of the lost volume with new customers representing long and short-term commercial commitments. However, due to the increased competitive pressures, it is possible that the profit margins achieved in the past will not be realized in the near term. Under the provisions of FASB Statement No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” companies are required to review their assets for potential impairment losses if there are certain impairment indicators present. Given these indicators, the Company evaluated the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by this terminal, whose long-lived assets are recorded at $59 million, and concluded that the forecasted future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the book value of the assets; therefore no impairment write-down is necessary at this time. 2002 vs. 2001 CSX World Terminals’ operating revenues were flat at $236 million in 2002 and 2001. Operating expenses were up $2 million in 2002 over 2001 due to lower earnings from equity investments. Miscellaneous operating expenses in 2002 and 2001 include $6 million and $3 million gains, respectively, from transactions relating to equity investments. Operating income was $69 million for 2002, a $2 million decrease from $71 million in 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Cash provided by operations for 2003 was $804 million, compared to $1.1 billion for 2002, and $827 million in 2001. The $323 million decrease in 2003, as compared to the prior year, reflects the $380 million termination of the accounts receivable facility. (See Note 8, Accounts Receivable). Excluding that, cash provided by operating activities was slightly higher than 2002, at $1.2 billion. Real estate activities contributed $122 million to operating cash flow, as compared to $137 million provided in 2002. In 2002 cash provided from operations was $1.1 billion, a $300 million increase over 2001. Higher operating income, lower interest expense and significant cash flow relating to real estate activities contributed to the increase, while there was a $85 million negative effect attributable to the New Orleans tank car fire settlement payment. Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities was $807 million in 2003 compared to $775 million in 2002 and $965 million in 2001. While 2003 capital expenditures approximated 2002 levels, 21 reduced proceeds from maturities of short-term investments led to the increase in cash used for investing activities. Proceeds of $214 million from the sale of CSX Lines in the first quarter of 2003 (See Note 3, Divestitures) helped to offset the impact of reduced short-term investment proceeds. Property additions totaled $1.1 billion in 2003 and 2002 and $930 million in 2001. The 2003 and 2002 increases over 2001 were related to replacement of cars and locomotives. Of Surface Transportation’s $1 billion in 2003 capital expenditures, substantially all related to replacing track, locomotives and other costs necessary to maintain the Company’s rail system. 2004 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1 billion. Financing Activities Financing activities provided cash of $172 million during 2003 and $15 million in 2001, compared to a $362 million use of cash during 2002. In 2003, net issuances of $419 million in long-term debt were principally used to repay short-term obligations incurred as a result of the termination of the Company’s accounts receivable sales program. Debt Issuances and Credit Facilities In December 2003, CSX executed a $75 million revolving loan facility that matures in 2005. Borrowings under the facility will bear interest at a rate that fluctuates with LIBOR. In addition, the Company pays an annual commitment fee of 0.15% for the period the facility is not drawn. This debt may be redeemed at any time after May 2004, with additional borrowings allowed through the maturity of the facility. As of December 26, 2003, the Company had $75 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under this borrowing. In November 2003, CSX issued $200 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Notes due 2014 and $200 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Notes due 2006. The 2014 Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.30% per year and mature on February 15, 2014. The 2006 Notes bear interest at the rate of 2.75% per year and mature on February 15, 2006. The 2014 Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time, but the 2006 Notes cannot be redeemed before maturity. In August 2003, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount Notes due 2013. These Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.50% and mature on August 1, 2013. The Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time. CSX increased its borrowings from Conrail by approximately $144 million year-over-year in 2003 in addition to the $146 million increase in 2002. Also, during 2002 the Conrail note was extended to a five year term. During 2002, CSX issued $200 million of 4.88% notes due in 2009 and $400 million of 6.30% notes due in 2012. The Company has a $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility and a $345 million 364-day revolving credit facility. Generally, these facilities may be used to support the Company’s commercial paper, working capital and other general corporate purposes. Under the 364-day facility, the Company pays an annual fee to the participating banks of .125% of total commitment. Under the five-year facility, the Company pays annual fees to the participating banks that may range from 0.08% to 0.23% of total commitment, depending on the Company’s credit rating. As of December 26, 2003, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under these facilities and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. CSX had commercial paper borrowings supported by these credit facilities of approximately $140 million at the end of 2002. 22 Debt Repayments CSX repaid long-term debt of $500 million in 2003, $1.2 billion in 2002, and $266 million in 2001. The Company also paid a net $141 million in short-term debt during 2003. The primary sources of 2003 repayments were the $214 million of proceeds from the conveyance of CSX Lines (see Note 3, Divestitures) and the issuance of new debt. Long-term and short-term debt at December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, totaled $7.3 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. The ratio of debt to total capitalization was 51% at the end of 2003, and 52% at the end of 2002 and 2001. Convertible Debentures In October 2001, CSX issued $564 million aggregate principal amount at maturity in unsubordinated zero coupon convertible debentures (the “debentures”) due October 30, 2021 for an initial offering price of approximately $462 million. At December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, outstanding debentures are included in long-term debt, at a carrying value of $447 million and $467 million, respectively. These debentures accrete (increase) in value at a yield to maturity of 1% per year. The accretion rate may be reset on October 30, 2007, October 30, 2011, and October 30, 2016 to a rate based on five-year United States Treasury Notes minus 2.8%. In no event, however, will the yield to maturity be reset below 1% or above 3% per annum. Accretion in value on the debentures is recorded for each period, but will not be paid prior to maturity. Under the terms of the debentures, holders had the option to require the Company to purchase their debentures at a purchase price equal to the accreted value of the debentures in October 2003. CSX purchased $15 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of the debentures at an aggregate cost of $13 million. In November 2003, the Company made a one-time cash payment of $23.00 per $1,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity to holders who did not require the Company to purchase their debentures. This resulted in a $13 million cash payment, which will be amortized over the remaining term of the debentures. In addition, the terms of the debentures were amended to permit holders to cause the Company to purchase the debentures on October 30, 2005, at their accreted value of $852.48 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, in addition to the purchase dates provided under the terms of the debentures. Similarly, the debentures allow holders to require the Company to purchase their debentures in October 2006, October 2008, October 2011, and October 2016, at a purchase price equal to the accreted value of the debentures. In 2005, 2006 and 2008, CSX may elect to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock, while CSX may pay the purchase price only in cash on the last two purchase dates. CSX may redeem the debentures for cash at any time on or after October 30, 2008, at a redemption price equal to the accreted value of the debentures. Holders may convert debentures into CSX common stock if certain requirements defined in the debentures and the related indenture are met. Holders may convert if the closing sale price of CSX common stock for at least 20 of the 30 preceding trading days is more than the applicable percentage (which is initially 120% and will decline over the life of the debentures to 110%) of the accreted conversion price per share of the Company’s common stock. The “accreted conversion price” per share of common stock is the quotient of the accreted value of a debenture divided by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of that debenture. Holders may also convert if the Company’s senior long-term unsecured credit ratings are downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service Inc. to below Ba1 and by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services to below BB+, if the debentures have been called for redemption, if the Company makes specified distributions to holders of CSX common stock, or if the company is a party to specified consolidations, mergers, or transfers or leases of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. For each debenture surrendered for conversion, a holder will initially receive 17.75 shares of CSX common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $46.16 23 per share. The initial conversion rate will be adjusted for reasons specified in the indenture, but will not be adjusted for accretion. Instead, accretion on the debentures will be deemed paid by the common stock received by the holder on conversion. Shelf Registration Statements CSX has $600 million of remaining capacity under a shelf registration that may be used, subject to market conditions, to issue debt or other securities at the Company’s discretion. The Company presently intends to use the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under its shelf registration statements to finance cash requirements, including refinancing existing debt as it matures. While the Company seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to meeting such needs, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit the Company to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. Dividends In mid-year 2001, the board of directors announced that the regular quarterly dividend payable would be reduced to 10 cents per share. CSX had paid a regular quarterly dividend of 30 cents per share since the fourth quarter of 1997 and did so through June of 2001. Dividends paid in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: 2003 2002 2001 Dividend Per Share $ 0.40 $ 0.40 $ 0.80 Total Cash Paid for Dividends (In Millions) $ 86 $ 86 $ 171 Working Capital The Company’s working capital deficit at December 26, 2003, was $307 million, as compared to $665 million at December 27, 2002. A working capital deficit is not unusual for the Company and other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due and has sufficient financial capacity to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any obligations arising from legal, tax and other regulatory rulings. Credit Ratings As of December 26, 2003, CSX Corporation’s long-term unsecured debt obligations were rated BBB and Baa2 by Standard and Poor’s and by Moody’s Investor Service, respectively. In the event CSX’s long-term unsecured bond ratings were reduced to BBB- and Baa3, the Company’s drawn and undrawn borrowing costs under the $1.0 billion and $345 million revolving credit facilities would not materially increase. However, at year-end 2003, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. The Company’s short-term commercial paper program is rated A-2 and P-2 by Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s Investor Service, respectively. Should these ratings decline to A-3 and P-3, the company’s cost and access to the commercial paper markets could be adversely affected. At year-end 2003, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 24 Schedule of Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations: Type of Obligation 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total (Millions of Dollars) Long-term Debt (see Note 11)(a) $ 426 $ 247 $ 598 $ 1,080 $ 615 $ 4,291 $ 7,257 Operating Leases — Net (see Note 18)(b) 150 138 112 117 98 516 1,131 Agreements with Conrail (see Note 2)(c) 260 247 236 229 224 3,118 4,314 Purchase Obligations (see Note 18)(d) 132 138 166 171 171 1,866 2,644 Total Contractual Obligations $ 968 $ 770 $ 1,112 $ 1,597 $ 1,108 $ 9,791 $ 15,346 The following table sets forth the maturities of the Company’s other commitments: Type of Commitment 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Unused Lines of Credit (see Note 11) $ 345 $ — $ 1,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,345 Guarantees (see Note 18)(e) 140 122 98 140 102 240 842 Other 99 14 8 — — 36 157 Total Other Commitments $ 584 $ 136 $ 1,106 $ 140 $ 102 $ 276 $ 2,344 (a) The fair market value of the interest rate swap agreements of $55 million, which is included in long-term debt on the balance sheet, is not included on the debt maturity schedule. Capital leases of $206 million are included in long-term debt. (b) CSX has entered into various operating lease agreements primarily for rail transportation equipment. (c) Agreements with Conrail represents commitments to pay Conrail per various agreements. (d) Commercial commitments consists of a $2.6 billion maintenance program which expires in 2026 relating to CSX’s fleet of locomotives. This program replaced an internal maintenance program. (e) Approximately $440 million of these guarantees relate to certain lease obligations that CSX remains contingently liable for that were assumed by Maersk. Accordingly, CSX has collateral liens on the assets relating to these leases and indemnities provided by Maersk that it will fulfill the commitments. CSX believes that Maersk will fulfill its contractual commitments with respect to such leases and that CSX will have no further liabilities relating to these obligations. Approximately $97 million relates to construction and cash deficiency support guarantees at one of the Company’s equity investments. CSX guarantees approximately $300 million relating to leases assumed as part of CSX’s conveyance of its interest in CSX Lines. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements There are no off-balance sheet arrangements, except as noted above, that are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Market Risk CSX addresses market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company addresses its exposure to interest rate market risk through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of interest rate swap agreements. As of December 26, 2003, the Company had various interest rate swap agreements on $1.3 billion of its outstanding notes payable. In the event of a 1% increase or decrease in the LIBOR interest rate, the interest expense related to these agreements would increase or decrease approximately $13 million on an annual basis. 25 During 2003, the Company began a program to hedge its exposure to fuel price volatility through swap transactions. As of December 26, 2003, CSX has hedged approximately 18% and 21% of expected requirements for 2004 and 2005, respectively. The Company expects that by the end of 2004 the programs will result in an increase in the amount of fuel hedged to approximately 76% of 2005 annual purchases. At December 26, 2003, a 1% change in fuel prices would result in an increase or decrease in the asset related to the swaps of approximately $1 million. The Company is subject to risk relating to changes in the price of diesel fuel. At the end of 2003, the Company had not entered into any long-term commitments for forward fuel purchases. The Company’s rail unit average annual fuel consumption is approximately 570 million gallons. A one-cent change in the price per gallon of fuel would impact fuel expense by approximately $6 million. The Company is exposed to loss in the event of non-performance by any counter-party to the interest rate swap or fuel hedging agreements. The Company does not anticipate non-performance by such counter-parties, and no material loss would be expected from non-performance. Exclusive of derivative contracts that swap fixed rate notes to floating interest rates, at December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, CSX had approximately $714 million and $709 million, respectively, of floating rate debt outstanding. A 1% variance in interest rates would on average effect annual interest expense by approximately $7 million. While the Company’s international terminals segment does business in several foreign countries, a substantial portion of its revenue and expenses are transacted in U.S. dollars, or currencies with little fluctuation against the U.S. dollar. For this reason, CSX does not believe its foreign currency market risk is significant. A substantial increase in the fair market value of the Company’s stock price could negatively impact earnings per share due to the dilutive effect of stock options and convertible debt. Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail See background, accounting and financial reporting effects and summary financial information in Note 2, Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail. Conrail’s Results of Operations 2003 vs. 2002 Conrail Inc. (“Conrail”) reported net income of $203 million in 2003, which included a cumulative effect of accounting change benefit of $40 million. Excluding the cumulative effect of accounting change, net income was $163 million, as compared with $180 million in 2002. Operating revenues were up $25 million to $918 million from the prior year. However, operating expenses were up 6% to $659 million. In June 2003, CSX, Norfolk Southern Corporation (“NS”) and Conrail jointly filed a petition with the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) to establish direct ownership and control by CSX’s and NS’ respective subsidiaries, CSX Transportation Inc. (“CSXT”) and Norfolk Southern Railway (“NSR”) of their portions of the Conrail system already operated by them separately and independently under various agreements. These portions of the Conrail system are currently owned by Conrail’s subsidiaries, New York Central Lines LLC (“NYC”) and Pennsylvania Lines LLC (“PRR”). The ownership of NYC and PRR would be transferred (“spun off”) to CSXT and NSR, respectively. Conrail would continue to own, manage and operate the Shared Asset Areas as previously approved by the STB. STB approval to proceed with the spin-off transaction and a favorable ruling from the IRS qualifying the 26 transaction as a non-taxable disposition were received in November 2003. The transaction remains subject to a number of other conditions. If all necessary conditions are satisfied, unsecured debt securities of newly formed subsidiaries of CSXT and NSR would be offered in a 42%/58% ratio in exchange for Conrail’s unsecured debentures. The debt securities issued by its respective subsidiary would be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CSXT or NSR. Upon completion of the proposed transaction, the subsidiaries would be merged into CSXT and NSR, respectively, and the new debt securities thus would become direct unsecured obligations of CSXT or NSR. Conrail’s secured debt and lease obligations will remain obligations of Conrail and are expected to be supported by new leases and subleases which, upon completion of the proposed transaction, would be the direct lease and sublease obligations, also on a 42%/58% ratio, of CSXT and NSR. CSX will record the proposed transaction at fair value based on the results of an independent valuation of NYC, with any difference from carrying value resulting in a gain or loss. The Company can not predict the outcome of the valuation and the impact on the Company’s financial statements. CSX, NS and Conrail are working to complete the spin-off transaction in 2004. Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, CSX’s investment in Conrail will no longer include the amounts related to NYC and PRR. Instead the assets and liabilities of NYC will be reflected in their respective line items in CSX’s consolidated balance sheet. Conrail will continue to own, manage and operate the Shared Asset Areas. 2002 vs. 2001 Conrail reported net income of $180 million in 2002, compared with $174 million in 2001. Operating revenues were down $10 million to $893 million in 2002, while operating expenses were favorable $16 million year-over-year. Lower costs in the Shared Asset Areas, tax settlements and lower reserve requirements for car hire, overcharges, interline and other claims helped improve 2002 results. Financial Condition and Liquidity Conrail’s operating activities provided cash of $412 million in 2003, compared with $423 million in 2002 and $502 million in 2001. The decrease in cash provided by operations in 2003 is a result of decreased operating income. The decrease in cash provided by operations in 2002 compared to 2001 reflected large payments of casualty claims. Cash generated from operations is the principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $57 million, $59 million and $61 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Capital expenditures were $35 million, $23 million and $47 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Total cash used for financing activities was $360 million, most of which results from an increase in the amount receivable from CSX and Norfolk Southern under their respective notes (See Note 2, Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail). Conrail had working capital deficits of $22 million and $29 million at December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, respectively. A working capital deficit is not unusual for the Company and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due and has sufficient financial capacity to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any obligations arising from legal, tax and other regulatory rulings. Divestitures In February 2003, CSX conveyed most of its interest in its domestic container-shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines LLC (“CSX Lines”), to a new venture formed with the Carlyle Group for approximately $300 million (gross cash proceeds of approximately $240 million, $214 million net of transaction costs, and $60 million of securities). CSX Lines was subsequently renamed 27 Horizon Lines LLC (“Horizon”). Horizon has subleased equipment and/or assigned vessel leases from certain affiliates of CSX covering the primary financial obligations related to $300 million of leases under which CSX or one of its affiliates will remain a lessee/ sublessor or guarantor. A deferred pretax gain of approximately $127 million as a result of the transaction will be recognized over the 12-year sub-lease term. Approximately $9 million of this gain was recognized during 2003. The securities have a term of 7 years and a preferred return feature. During the third quarter, CSX received a $15 million payment from Horizon Lines, which included $3 million of interest, in return of a portion of its investment in Horizon and now holds $48 million of securities. Other Matters Matters Arising out of Sale of International Container-Shipping Assets In 2003, CSX finalized a settlement agreement with Maersk resolving all remaining material disputes pending directly between the two companies, consisting predominantly of two major disputes. The first dispute involved a post-closing working capital adjustment to the sale price for which the Company had recorded a receivable of approximately $70 million. The second dispute involved a claim of 425 million Dutch Guilders (approximately $180 million at then prevailing currency exchange rates) plus interest by Europe Container Terminals BV (“ECT”) alleging breaches of contract by the Company at the Rotterdam container terminal facility owned by ECT. Also in 2003, CSX entered into a final settlement agreement with Maersk allocating responsibility between the two companies for third party claims and litigation relating to the assets acquired by Maersk. The two settlements reduced the Company’s 2003 earnings by $108 million pretax, $67 million after tax. This charge is reflected in the financial statements as an additional loss on the sale of the international container-shipping assets. Neither settlement has a material impact on cash flows. Restructuring In November 2003, the Company announced a management restructuring plan to streamline the structure at a number of its companies, eliminate organizational layers and realign certain functions. The initiative will reduce the non-union workforce by 800 to 1,000 positions over the last quarter of 2003 and the first half of 2004. As of December 26, 2003, 20 employees have been terminated under this program. The Company recorded an initial charge related to this reduction of $34 million pretax, in 2003, to record the lowest amount of expense to be incurred under this program. The total estimated cost of the program is expected to be in the range of $60 million to $80 million. The majority of separation benefits will be paid from CSX’s qualified pension plans, with the remainder being paid from general corporate funds. Also in 2003, the Company recorded a $10 million restructuring charge related to another workforce reduction program. Substantially all of this amount had been paid out at December 27, 2003. In 2003, the Company recorded a $22 million pretax credit related to a favorable change in estimate related to the 1991 and 1992 separation plans. These plans provided for workforce reductions, improvements in productivity and other cost reductions. The reduction in estimate for these plans results from lower railroad retirement taxes and other benefits than had been built into the initial $1.3 billion charge. A net $22 million restructuring charge was recorded representing the cost of the restructuring initiatives offset by reductions in 1991/1992 separation reserves. The associated expense is included in operating expense on the Income Statement as “Restructuring Charge — Net.” 28 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas: 1. Casualty, legal and environmental reserves 2. Pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 3. Depreciation policies for its assets under the group-life method These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. 1. Casualty, Legal and Environmental Reserves Casualty Reserve Management Casualty reserves represent accruals for the uninsured portion of occupational injury and personal injury claims. These reserves are recorded upon the first reporting of a claim, and estimates are updated as information develops. The amount of liability accrued is based on the type and severity of the claim, and an estimate of future claims development based on current trends and historical data. The Company believes it has recorded liabilities in sufficient amounts to cover all identified claims and estimates of incurred but not reported personal injury claims for the next seven years. During 2003, the Company retained third party professionals to work with it to project the number of asbestos and other occupational injury claims to be received over the next seven years and the related costs. Based on this analysis the Company established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable asbestos and other occupational injury liabilities. Other occupational claims include allegations of exposure to certain materials in the work place, such as solvents and diesel fuel, or alleged physical injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or hearing loss. In conjunction with the change in estimate, in 2003 the Company recorded a charge of $206 million to increase its provision for these claims. Approximately $141 million of this amount relates to asbestos claims. Additionally, the provision for personal injury claims was increased by $26 million as a result of a change in estimate. Estimates for all of these claims are subject to significant uncertainty relating to the outcomes of negotiated settlements and other developments and are not suited to subjecting to a sensitivity analysis. As facts and circumstances change, the Company may have to change its estimates, and changes could have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. Events such as adverse verdicts, catastrophic accidents and legal settlements will cause the Company to revise its estimated liabilities, which the Company reviews and appropriately adjusts quarterly. Personal and occupational injury liabilities amount to $864 million and $605 million at December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, respectively. (See Note 10, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves). Legal Reserves In accordance with SFAS 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is (1) probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and (2) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the 29 contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities on an ongoing basis and records reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. In 2003, CSX finalized a settlement agreement with Maersk resolving all remaining material disputes pending directly between the two companies, consisting predominantly of two major disputes. The two settlements reduced the Company’s 2003 earnings by $108 million pretax, $67 million after tax. This charge is reflected in the financial statements as an additional loss on the sale of the international container-shipping assets. Neither settlement has a material impact on cash flows. In 2001 Duke Energy Corporation (“Duke”) filed a complaint before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board alleging that certain CSXT common carrier coal rates are unreasonably high. In February 2004, the STB issued a decision finding that the CSXT common carrier rates were reasonable. While approving the rate levels, the STB also invited Duke to request a phase-in of rate increases over some time period. The nature and amount of any such phase-in is uncertain, and would only apply to billings subsequent to December 2001. CSXT will continue to consider and pursue all available legal defenses in this matter. Administrative and legal appeals are possible, and could take several years to resolve. An unfavorable outcome to this complaint would not have a material effect on the Company. The Company increased a reserve in 2001 to account for the impact of the negotiated settlement of the New Orleans tank car fire. This negotiation resulted in the Company recording an additional charge of $60 million pretax, $37 million after tax in 2001. Environmental Management CSXT is a party to various proceedings, including administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and regulatory agencies related to environmental issues. CSXT has been identified as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) at approximately 260 environmentally impaired sites, many of which are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the Federal Superfund statute (“Superfund”) or similar state statutes. A number of these proceedings are based on allegations that CSXT, or its railroad predecessors, sent hazardous substances to the facilities in question for disposal. Some of the proceedings involve property formerly or currently owned by CSXT or its railroad predecessors. Proceedings arising under Superfund or similar state statutes can involve numerous other companies who generated the waste or owned or operated the property and involve the allocation of liability for costs associated with site investigation and cleanup, which could be substantial. At least once each quarter, CSXT reviews its role with respect to each such location, giving consideration to a number of factors, including: • the type of cleanup required, • the nature of CSXT’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site, or owner or operator of the site), • the extent of CSXT’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors), • the accuracy and strength of evidence connecting CSXT to the location, • and the number, connection, and financial viability of other named and unnamed PRP’s at the location. Based on the review process, CSXT has recorded reserves to cover estimated contingent future environmental costs with respect to such sites. The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs at December 26, 2003, and December 27, 2002 were $45 million and 30 $35 million, respectively. These liabilities, which are undiscounted, include amounts representing CSXT’s estimate of unasserted claims, which CSXT believes to be immaterial. The liability includes future costs for all sites where the Company’s obligation is (1) deemed probable and (2) can be reasonably estimated. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. During 2003, the Company increased its estimate for environmental liabilities by a net $10 million due to continuing evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve. The majority of the December 26, 2003 environmental liability is expected to be paid out over the next seven years. The Company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. Also, changes in federal and state laws and regulations may impact, favorably or unfavorably, the effort required to remediate sites. In addition, latent conditions at any given location could result in exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to accomplish remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will not materially affect its overall results of operations and financial condition. 2. Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Accounting The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans, principally for salaried personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based principally on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. In addition to the defined benefit pension plans, the Company sponsors three plans that provide medical and life insurance benefits to most full-time salaried employees upon their retirement. The postretirement medical plans are contributory (partially funded by retirees), with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance plan is non-contributory. The benefit obligation for these plans represents the liability of the Company for current and retired employees and is affected primarily by the following: 1. Service cost (benefits attributed to employee service during the period) 2. Interest cost (interest on the liability due to the passage of time) 3. Actuarial gains/losses (experience during the year different from that assumed and changes in plan assumptions) 4. Benefits paid to participants Plan assets are amounts that have been segregated and restricted to provide benefits, and include amounts contributed by the Company and amounts earned from investing contributions, less benefits paid. The pension plans are funded at not less than the minimum funding standards set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Plan assets consist primarily of common stocks, corporate bonds and cash and cash equivalents. The Company funds the cost of the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in SFAS No. 87, “Employers Accounting for Pensions,” and SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” Both of these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the following: 1. Long-term rate of return of plan assets 2. Discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense 3. Salary scale inflation rates 4. Health care cost trend rates and other assumptions 31 All of these assumptions and estimates can have a significant impact on the Company’s accounting for these plans and the amount of expense recorded in a reporting period. These assumptions are made as of the beginning of the year. The Company uses a plan year of Oct. 1 through Sept. 30 to value its pension and postretirement plans on an actuarial basis. As permitted by SFAS 87, the Company has elected to use this fiscal year as it provides for more timely analysis. The Company engages third-party actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects for its plans. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Additionally, as CSX expects a curtailment (event that impacts the future service, and therefore benefits, to be earned by employees under the plan), to occur in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the Management Restructuring, and accordingly, will review actuarial assumptions as required by SFAS 88 and SFAS 106. The impact of the curtailment is expected to be immaterial. Currently, the Company does not expect any significant changes to its assumptions. Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected return on the Company’s pension plan assets is based on the Company’s expectation of the long-term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds (based on a composite yield of AA-rated corporate bonds), which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds. As this estimate is long-term, it is not adjusted as frequently as other assumptions used in pension accounting. However, the impact of the last few years’ overall market returns did cause CSX to reevaluate the rate used in calculating its liability at September 30, 2002 (the end of the measurement period for 2002) and adjust it from 9.5% to 8.9%. This change will increase the amount of pension expense reported in future periods. The Company evaluated the investment performance during 2003 as well as future expectations and determined that an adjustment to the long-term rate of return is not warranted. CSX will continue to evaluate its performance on an ongoing basis and if appropriate will adjust the long-term rate of return. A 1% change in the rate of return assumption would change pension expense by $15 million. Discount Rates Discount rates are based on comparable rates for long-term liabilities that reflect a similar time horizon to payments that the Company will make for pension and postretirement medical payments. These rates are analyzed every year and adjusted accordingly. As such, management has minimal discretion with respect to the discount rates used. The discount rate impacts the amount of liability recorded and also the amount of the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense. CSX’s assumed discount rates used in calculating the liability at September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, respectively, were 6.0% and 6.5% for the pension liabilities and 5.0% and 5.5% for postretirement medical benefits. The difference between the rate used for pension vs. postretirement is due to the different time horizon of future payments. Salary Scale Inflation Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews this assumption on a regular basis and makes adjustments when appropriate. CSX lowered this rate from 4.5% in 2001 to 3.3% for 2002 and 2003. Health Care Cost Trend Rates The health care cost trend rate is based on current trends and historical data. Due to the increasing costs of providing health care benefits, the Company increased the inflation assumption for health care costs for the 2002 year. No changes were deemed necessary to the health care cost trend rate in 2003. The current assumed rate is 11% decreasing gradually until 32 reaching 4.5% in 2012. A 1% change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would effect expense by $2 million. Summary Pension Assumptions Postretirement Pension Benefits Benefits 2003 2002 2003 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Expected Long-term Return on Plan Assets: Benefit Cost for Plan Year 8.90% 9.50% n/a n/a Benefit Obligation at End of Plan Year 8.90% 8.90% n/a n/a Discount Rates: Benefit Cost for Plan Year 6.50% 7.25% 5.50% 7.25% Benefit Obligation at End of Plan Year 6.00% 6.50% 5.00% 5.50% Salary Scale Inflation 3.30% 3.30% 3.30% 3.30% Other Assumptions Relating to Pensions and Postretirement Benefits The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover, and retirement age. These assumptions are based on historical data and are approved by management. As a result of changes in assumptions for fiscal year 2004, net periodic pension benefit cost and postretirement benefit costs for 2004 are expected to increase approximately $7 million. In December 2003, the President of the United States signed into law the “Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (“the Act”), which introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS 106 requires that changes in the law that take effect in the future and affect future benefit coverage shall be considered in current-period benefit measurements. However, as significant uncertainties exist for how to account for the subsidy a plan sponsor may not have sufficient information available to measure effects of the Act, prepare related actuarial valuations, and ensure proper accounting. Therefore, FASB has issued staff position No. FAS 106-1 which allows a plan sponsor to elect to defer recognizing the effects of the Act until authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued, or until certain other events occur. When the guidance is issued, it may cause CSX to revise previously reported information. CSX is currently evaluating how this legislation may impact its postretirement benefit plans. (See Note 17, “Employee Benefit Plans.”) 3. Depreciation Policies Under the Group-Life Method The Company accounts for its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method. This method pools similar assets by road and equipment type and then depreciates each group as a whole. These assets represent 94% of the Company’s total fixed assets and amounted to $12.9 billion on a net basis at December 26, 2003. Under the group-life method, the useful lives of rail assets are determined by the performance of a life-study which includes: • statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property • evaluation of the current operations • previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use • comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies. 33 The results of the life study process determine the service lives for each asset group. These studies are conducted by a third party expert and analyzed by the Company’s management. Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact future periods depreciation expense and thus the Company’s results of operations. Events that could cause the Company to change its estimates relating to the lives of its asset groups could be changes in historical results, technological improvements and changes in specific assets. In 2003, the Company completed life studies for all of its rail assets. The effect of theses studies was to increase the average useful lives on its equipment and track assets, while decreasing the average useful lives on many of the roadway assets. These changes in average useful lives of the assets will have minimal net reduction on depreciation expense in the future. As a result, the net increase in depreciation expense was $1 million in 2003, while the impact will be a decrease of approximately $13 million in 2004 and thereafter. Additionally, with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” in 2003, CSX recorded pretax income of $93 million, $57 million after tax as a cumulative effect of an accounting change, representing the reversal of the accrued liability for crosstie removal costs. On an ongoing basis, depreciation expense will be reduced, while labor and fringe and materials, supplies and other expense will be increased by approximately $12 million annually. In 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants voted to approve the Statement of Position (SOP) Accounting for Certain Costs and Activities related to Property, Plant and Equipment and presented it to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for approval. If the FASB causes the SOP to be applicable, certain costs and activities that are currently capitalized may require immediate recognition and alternatively, some costs and activities that are currently expensed may require capitalization. In addition, the SOP will require additional refinement in asset componentization, potentially altering the amount of depreciation expense recognized. While the Company is evaluating the proposal, it has not yet determined what effect it may have if passed by the FASB. However, the effect could be material. New Accounting Pronouncements and Change In Accounting Policy SFAS 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” was issued in 2001. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. In conjunction with the group-life method of accounting for asset costs, the Company historically accrued crosstie removal costs as a component of depreciation, which is not permitted under SFAS 143. As noted above, with the adoption of SFAS 143 in fiscal year 2003, CSX recorded pretax income of $93 million, $57 million after tax as a cumulative effect of an accounting change, representing the reversal of the accrued liability for crosstie removal costs. The adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on prior reporting periods, and the Company does not believe it will have a material effect on future earnings. On an ongoing basis, depreciation expense will be reduced, while labor and fringe and materials, supplies and other expense will be increased by approximately $12 million annually. SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure” was issued in December 2002. SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide alternative methods of transition to Statement 123’s fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and require disclosure of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation. Effective beginning with fiscal year 2003, CSX has voluntarily adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure — an amendment of SFAS 123.” In accordance with the prospective method of 34 adoption permitted under SFAS 148, stock-based awards issued subsequent to fiscal year 2002 are accounted for under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 utilizing the Black-Scholes valuation method and, accordingly, are expensed. (See Note 15, Stock Plans.) In 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which requires a variable interest entity (“VIE”) to be consolidated by a company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns, or both. Interpretation No. 46 also requires disclosures about VIEs that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. Also in 2003, Interpretation 46 (“46R”), a revision to FASB Interpretation No. 46 was issued, to clarify some of the provisions of, and to exempt certain entities from Interpretation 46 requirements. Under the new guidance, CSX will consolidate Four Rivers Transportation, Inc. (“FRT”), a shortline railroad, into its financial statements at the beginning of fiscal 2004. Presently, FRT is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The adoption of Interpretation No. 46 will not have a material impact on results of operations in future reporting periods. In 2002, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standard Interpretation (“FASI”) No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” This statement requires that certain guarantees be recorded at fair value on the statement of financial position and additional disclosures be made about guarantees. CSX did not realize a financial statement impact with the adoption of the accounting provisions of this statement in fiscal year 2003 and does not anticipate a future impact. (See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies.) In 2001, SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, was issued. Under the provisions of SFAS 142, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized, but are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis. The Company adopted this standard for fiscal 2002, and incurred a pretax charge of $83 million, $43 million after tax and minority interest as a cumulative effect of an accounting change, which represents the difference between book value and the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets. These indefinite lived intangible assets are permits and licenses that the Company holds relating to a proposed pipeline to transfer natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to the port in Valdez, Alaska. The fair value was determined using a discount method of projected future cash flows relating to these assets. The carrying value of these assets is now approximately $3 million. The adoption of SFAS 142 did not have a material effect on prior reporting periods, and the Company does not believe it will have a material effect on future earnings. The Company does not have any other significant indefinite lived intangible assets. In 2002, SFAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” was issued. This statement requires that long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are no longer measured on a net realizable value basis, and future operating losses are no longer recognized before they occur. In addition, this statement modifies the reporting requirements for discontinued operations. Long-lived assets, whether to be held for disposition or held and used, should be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to dispose. The Company applied the provisions of this statement relating to the accounting for the conveyance of its wholly-owned subsidiary, CSX Lines, to a third party in 2003 (See Note 3, Divestitures). In addition, another of the Company’s subsidiaries, CSX World Terminals, was notified of a significant customer loss for 2004 and possible customer loss for 2005. Given these indicators, the Company evaluated the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by this terminal, whose long-lived assets are recorded at $59 million and concluded that the forecasted future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the book value of its long-lived assets, therefore no impairment write-down is necessary at this time. 35 Regulation and Legislation Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) of the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Railroad Administration of DOT and other state and regulatory agencies. The regulation and legislation passed by these organization can significantly affect the costs and profitability of the Company’s business. In response to the heightened threat of terrorism in the wake of the September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, Pentagon and airline infrastructure, federal, state and local regulatory agencies are evaluating various proposals with respect to the transportation industry. Some of these proposals relate to the transport of hazardous material. Certain metropolitan areas considered at high risk for a terrorist attack may be the subject of future regulation. The ultimate legislation passed by federal, state and local regulators related to issues of security has the potential to severely affect CSX’s operations and costs. Factors Expected to Influence 2004 During the upcoming year, there are several key areas which continue to affect the operations and profitability of CSX. Management believes that the Company must remain focused on improving the efficiency of its rail network, reducing its operating expense and restoring higher service levels. General economic factors, including the cost of fuel, may also influence 2004 operating results. Improving operating efficiency in Surface Transportation while maintaining volume is critical to success in lowering the operating ratio, and in turn improving financial performance. To do so, management believes that CSX must optimize its network routing, including a reduction in both gross ton miles and the number of times a car is handled or switched en route to the final destination. CSX is utilizing internal and external consultants to assist with the network optimization effort. Fuel represents a significant expense of CSX Surface Transportation operations and was a factor in 2003 expense increases. Fuel prices can vary significantly from period to period and significantly impact future results. Although CSX has implemented a fuel price hedging program, it will remain subject to fuel price fluctuations for the majority of 2004 fuel purchases. Approximately 18% of 2004 fuel purchases are currently hedged at an average cost of 70 cents per gallon, exclusive of taxes and transportation costs. Each month, the Company is systematically increasing its hedged amount so that in July of 2005, 76% of the estimated fuel purchases should be hedged for a 24 month period. CSX faces inherent business risk of exposure to property damage and personal injury claims in the event of train accidents, including derailments. The Company is also subject to exposure to occupational injury claims. While CSX is working diligently to enhance its safety programs and to continue to raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety, the Company cannot ensure that it will not experience any material property damage, personal or occupational claims in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. Additionally, the Company cannot ensure that existing claims will not suffer adverse development not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors which are outside of CSX’s control. CSX engages outside parties to assist with the evaluation of certain of the occupational and personal injury claims, and believes that it is adequately reserved to cover all potential claims. However, final amounts determined to be due to any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves. The ability of the Company to effectively implement the management restructuring will be an important factor in future success. Once complete, the organization of the Company should be conducive to enhanced accountability, faster, more reliable communication, better decision 36 making and a more competitive cost structure. Executing the restructuring while minimizing the impact of the possible disruption associated with the elimination of a significant portion of the Company’s existing management will be critical to the Company’s short-term success. The ability of the Company to replace, in both the long and short-term, the business lost due to competitive pressures in the Hong Kong terminals market will have a direct impact on the profitability of the Company’s International Terminals segment. While management is diligently working to attract new customers, there can be no guarantee that new customers will be gained. Also, it is likely that the margins experienced in the past at the Company’s Hong Kong terminal operations will not continue for the near term, even if the lost volume is replaced. The International Terminals segment’s revenue and operating income represented approximately 3% and 11% of the Company’s consolidated revenues and operating income, respectively for 2003.

Properties CSX’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and each category is described below. Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network extends from New York, Philadelphia and Boston to the Southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans and to the Midwestern cities of East St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago. The Company’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards (referred to as mainline track); track within terminals and switching yards; track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains; and track connecting the mainline track to customer locations. As of December 30, 2005, the breakdown of these track miles is as follows: Track Miles Mainline Track 26,865 Terminals and Switching Yards 9,774 Passing Sidings and Turnouts 1,031 Total 37,670 In addition to its physical track structure, CSXT operates 36 major yards and terminals, plus a number of smaller facilities. These sites serve as the links between the Company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where shipments are classified and routed to other areas around the nation. CSXT’s train operations are focused around four major transportation networks: the Coal Network, the Southeastern Corridor, the Interstate 90 Corridor, and the Interstate 95 Corridor. Coal Network Coal is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the United States. The CSX coal network connects mining operations in nine states with industrial areas in the Northeast as well as many river, lake and seaport facilities. These routes also support CSXT’s strong and growing utility market in the Southeast. Southeastern Corridor This section of the network runs on the western side of CSXT’s system from Chicago and the Western gateways, through the cities of Atlanta, Nashville and Birmingham to markets throughout the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is a vital route for CSXT’s merchandise and Intermodal’s traffic as well as automotive services. Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor Chicago and metropolitan areas in New York and New England are linked by CSX’s I-90 corridor. Much of this route has two lanes of track side by side (referred to as double mainline track) supporting high-speed intermodal and automotive services. The I-90 corridor is also a primary route for import traffic moving across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the growing Southeast are connected to the heavily populated northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York 5 Table of Contents along CSXT’s I-95 corridor. This route is used for certain CSX merchandise business, which primarily includes food and consumer products along with metals and chemicals. Locomotives CSXT operates more than 3,700 locomotives, of which approximately 500 are under short-term lease arrangements. Freight locomotives are the power used primarily to pull trains. Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort rail cars so that the right rail car gets attached to the right train in order to get it to its final destination. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain.

Insulated boxcars deliver food products, canned goods, and certain beverages. • Covered hoppers have a permanent roof. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in small cube-covered hoppers. • Other cars on the network include but are not limited to center beam cars for transporting lumber and building products.

Examples of these are railcars owned by other railroads, which are interchanged to CSXT; shipper-furnished (“private”) cars, which are generally used only in that shipper’s services; and multi-level railcars. These multi-level railcars are used to transport finished motor vehicles, such as sport utility vehicles and light trucks in bi-level cars, while sedans and smaller automobiles are shipped in try-level cars. Multi-level railcars are used jointly by participating railroads, and the fleet is managed as a nationwide pool to serve the automobile industry. As noted, in certain markets, CSXT uses railcars supplied by railroad customers. For example, chemical shippers typically supply tank cars for the transportation of hazardous and non-hazardous material. The information set forth in Item 7.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16, Business Segments. 5 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Item 1A. Risk Factors The following important risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company’s forward-looking statements. Although the risks described below are those that management believes are the most significant, these are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not deem to be material also may materially affect our business, financial condition or future results of operations. New legislation or regulatory changes could increase the Company’s cost of operations. The Company is subject to various regulatory jurisdictions, including the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) of the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Railroad Administration of the DOT and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. Legislation passed by Congress or regulations issued by these agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company’s business. For example, additional regulations related to carbon dioxide could result in reduced coal production and higher expenses related to locomotive emissions, which would adversely affect the Company’s income from operations. Moreover, the Company could be negatively affected by the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and beginning to adopt various legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry, such as the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism. This voluntary initiative was designed to strengthen a portion of the supply chain for international shipments by requiring minimum security thresholds. Legislation, regulations, or rules enacted by federal, state or local governmental bodies relating to security issues that affect rail and intermodal transportation could negatively impact the Company. CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. Under Federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation. A rail accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation. General economic and geo-political risks may affect the Company’s operations. Inflation or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for rail or intermodal services could adversely affect our results of operations. Abrupt political change or terrorist activity pose a risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements, thus increasing our operating costs. These conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and purchasing decisions by our customers. Furthermore, fuel prices and supply are influenced by international political and economic circumstances. Although a fuel surcharge recovery program is in place with a considerable number of customers, the Company could be negatively impacted if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to OPEC or other production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise. 6 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs. The Company’s operations are subject to wide-ranging federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, discharges into water, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials, and clean-up of hazardous material or petroleum releases. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned and used by the Company. The Company has been, and may be subject to, allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company’s incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. Future acts of terrorism or war may cause significant disruptions in the Company’s operations. Terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred in the United States in September 2001, in Spain in March 2004, in England in July 2005, and in India in July 2006, along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect results of operations. CSXT’s rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available. Increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company faces inherent business risk from exposure to property damage, occupational injury claims, and personal injury claims resulting from train accidents, worker injury claims under FELA, and claims from outside parties resulting from the Company’s operations. Although the Company is working diligently to enhance its safety programs and to continue to raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety, the Company could experience material property damage or personal injury or occupational claims in the future and it may incur significant costs to defend such claims. Existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company’s control. The Company establishes reserves to cover all claims. However, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves. Network difficulties could have a negative impact on the Company’s rail and intermodal operational efficiency. CSXT cannot be sure that it will not experience rail network difficulties related to network capacity, dramatic and unplanned increases in demand for rail service, or increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas that could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational fluidity. 7 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Also, the Company may face external factors such as severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes, which may disrupt the Company’s operations. For information about the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, see Note 5, Hurricane Katrina. The Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. The Company is subject to various existing lawsuits and potential, future, unknown litigation. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend any such lawsuits. Additionally, existing litigation may suffer adverse development not currently reflected in its reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the Company’s control. While the Company uses its best efforts to evaluate existing litigation, the final judgments may differ materially from the recorded reserves. The limited availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect the Company’s operations. Changes in demographics, training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel, could each have a negative impact on CSXT’s ability to meet demand for rail service. In addition, approximately 27% of the Company’s workforce will be eligible for retirement within the next five years. Increases in demand for qualified personnel and unexpected increases in demand for rail services may aggravate these risks. Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes, work stoppages. Most of CSXT’s employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Generally speaking, these agreements are bargained nationally by the National Carriers Committee. In the rail industry, negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Over the last 30 years, there were only six days of work stoppage related to labor disputes over national handling. A negotiating process for new collective bargaining agreements started with the issuance of bargaining notices in November 2004 and the outcome of the current round of negotiations is uncertain at this time. The existing agreements will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached. Under the Railway Labor Act’s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of Presidential intervention), neither party may exercise self-help until the procedures are exhausted. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties by Segment Rail Property CSXT’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars. These categories and the geography of the network are described below. Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the Midwestern cities of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago. 8 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I CSXT’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards (known as mainline track); track within terminals and switching yards; track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains; track connecting the mainline track to customer locations; and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Track miles are greater than the Company’s 21,000 route miles, which reflect the size of CSX’s rail network that connects markets, customers, and western railroads. At December 2006, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track Miles Mainline track 26,629 Terminals and switching yards 9,550 Passing sidings and turnouts 1,018 Total 37,197 In addition to its physical track structure, CSXT operates numerous yards and terminals. These serve as the hubs between the company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received, re-sorted, and placed onto new outbound trains. The following thirty-six yards are identified as key to the CSXT system: Rail Yards or Terminals Birmingham, AL Detroit, MI Mobile, AL Hamlet, NC Montgomery, AL Rocky Mount, NC Baldwin, FL Buffalo, NY Moncrief (Jacksonville), FL Selkirk, NY Tampa, FL Syracuse, NY Atlanta, GA Cincinnati, OH East Savannah, GA Cleveland, OH Waycross, GA Columbus, OH Avon (Indianapolis), IN Stanley (Toledo), OH Chicago, IL Walbridge (Toledo), OH Evansville, IN Willard, OH Louisville, KY Greenwich (Philadelphia), PA Russell, KY Charleston, SC New Orleans, LA Florence, SC Cumberland, MD Erwin, TN Curtis Bay (Baltimore), MD Nashville, TN Locust Point (Baltimore), MD Richmond, VA For a list of Intermodal’s terminals, see page 12. 9 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Network Geography CSXT’s train operations primarily are focused around the following four major transportation networks, which are defined geographically or by line of business and are described below. Coal Network – Coal is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the United States. The CSXT coal network connects mining operations in nine states with industrial areas in the northeast and mid-Atlantic as well as many river, lake and seaport facilities. These routes also support CSXT’s strong and growing utility market in the southeast. Southeastern Corridor – This section of the network runs on the western side of CSXT’s system between Chicago and central Florida through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta. This corridor also connects the vital gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis with the major markets of the southeast. CSXT’s capacity investment in this corridor clearly strengthens this route and makes it the premier rail route connecting these key cities and gateways with the growing southeast. The corridor extends through the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and provides direct rail service between these coal sources and the increasing demand for coal in the southeast. The increase in capacity on this corridor positions CSXT well to handle the projected traffic volumes of intermodal, coal, automotive, and general merchandise traffic. Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor – Chicago and metropolitan areas in New York and New England are linked by CSXT’s I-90 Corridor. Much of this route has two lanes of track side-by-side (referred to as double mainline track) supporting high-speed intermodal and automotive services. The I-90 Corridor is also a primary route for import traffic moving across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the northeast. Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the growing southeast are connected to the heavily populated northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York along CSXT’s I-95 Corridor. This route is used for certain portions of CSXT’s merchandise business, which primarily includes food and consumer products along with metals and chemicals. Locomotives CSXT operates more than 3,800 locomotives. Freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull rail cars. Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar gets attached to the right train in order to get it to its final destination. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. At December 2006, CSXT’s owned and long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following: Locomotives % Freight 3,335 87% Switching 327 8% Auxiliary Units 189 5% Total 3,851 100% 10 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Freight Car Fleet CSXT’s freight car fleet consists of five main types of cars. Gondolas support CSXT’s coal and metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Flat cars are used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers, while box cars transport commodities that must be protected from the weather, such as paper products, appliances and building materials. Insulated boxcars deliver food products, canned goods, and certain beverages. Additionally, CSXT has open-top hoppers, which handle heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions, and covered hoppers, which have a permanent roof. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in small cube-covered hoppers. Finally, other cars owned or leased on the network include, but are not limited to, center beam cars for transporting lumber and building products. At December 2006, CSXT’s owned and long-term leased freight car fleet consisted of the following: Freight Cars % Gondolas 29,010 29 % Open-top hoppers 20,447 20 Flat cars 19,830 20 Box cars 15,748 15 Covered hoppers 15,256 15 Other cars 1,311 1 Total 101,602 100 % At any point in time, over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by CSXT. Examples of these are railcars owned by other railroads (which are interchanged to CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper’s service) and multi-level railcars. Multi-level railcars are used to transport finished motor vehicles, such as sport utility vehicles and light trucks in bi-level cars, while sedans and smaller automobiles are shipped in tri-level cars. Multi-level railcars are owned jointly by participating railroads, and the fleet is managed as a nationwide pool to serve the automobile industry. As noted, in certain markets, CSXT uses railcars supplied by railroad customers. For example, chemical shippers typically supply tank cars for the transportation of hazardous and non-hazardous materials. 11 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Intermodal Property Infrastructure Intermodal serves 47 terminals in 21 states. These terminals serve as a transfer point between rail and trucks. If the city has more than one terminal, it is indicated by the number next to it.

Containers are weather-proof designed boxes used for bulk shipment of freight, and chassis are the wheeled support framework for a container that allows it to be attached to a tractor. All of CSX’s chassis are leased. CSX also has other types of equipment such as doublestack railcars, which are railcars that allow for two containers to be mounted one above the other. At December 29, 2006, Intermodal owned or long-term leased equipment consisted of the following: Equipment 0% Containers 13,705 30% Chassis 30,826 69% Other 433 1% Total 44,964 100% 12 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Item 3.
