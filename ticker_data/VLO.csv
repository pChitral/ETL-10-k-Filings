We reported a loss from continuing operations of $352 million, or $0.65 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $1.0 billion, or $1.93 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The results of continuing operations for 2009 were unfavorably impacted by asset impairment losses of $230 million ($150 million after tax), which are discussed further below, as well as a $140 million loss contingency accrual (including interest) related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales and other tax matters involving the Government of Aruba. The 2008 results included a before-tax and after-tax loss of $4.0 billion resulting from the impairment of goodwill, which is further discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, 2008 results included $86 million of pre-tax asset impairment losses ($56 million after tax) and a $305 million pre-tax gain ($170 million after tax) on the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery. In November 2009, we announced the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery due to financial losses caused by poor economic conditions, significant capital spending requirements, and high operating costs. As a result of the shutdown, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $1.9 billion, which is discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery, which include this loss and other asset impairment losses, are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. Due to the impact of the continuing economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals during 2009, we continued to assess our refining segment assets for potential impairment. This evaluation included an assessment of our operating assets as well as an evaluation of our capital projects classified as “construction in progress.” As a result of this analysis, certain capital projects were permanently cancelled, resulting in pre-tax write-offs of $230 million of project costs relating to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally during 2009, we wrote off pre-tax project costs of $178 million related to our Delaware City Refinery, which are reported in discontinued operations as discussed above. Also due to these poor industry conditions, in June 2009, we announced our plan to shut down the Aruba Refinery temporarily as narrow heavy sour crude oil differentials made the refinery uneconomical to operate. The Aruba Refinery was shut down in July 2009 and is expected to continue to be shut down until market conditions improve. Our profitability from our operations is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the “refined product margin.” The economic slowdown that existed throughout 2009 caused a continuing weakness in demand for refined products, which put pressure on refined product margins during 2009. This reduced demand, combined with increased inventory levels, caused a significant decline in diesel and jet fuel margins during 2009 compared to 2008. However, gasoline margins improved in 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, lower costs of crude oil and other feedstocks significantly improved margins on certain secondary products, such as asphalt, fuel oils, and petroleum coke, during 2009 compared to 2008. Because more than 60% of our total crude oil throughput generally consists of sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that historically have been purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil, our profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the “sour crude oil differential.” Sour crude oil differentials for the year ended December 31, 2009 were substantially lower than the 2008 differentials. We believe that this decline in sour crude oil differentials was partially caused by a reduction in sour crude oil production by OPEC and 28 Table of Contents other producers, which reduced the supply of sour crude oil and increased the price of sour crude oils relative to sweet crude oils. In addition, high prices of residual fuel oil relative to sweet crude oil prices caused a significant reduction in discounts realized on residual fuel oil that we processed during 2009. These higher residual fuel oil prices also contributed to the decrease in sour crude oil differentials because sour crude oil competes with residual fuel oil as a refinery feedstock. In March 2009, we issued $750 million of 10-year notes and $250 million of 30-year notes. Proceeds from these notes were used to make $209 million of scheduled debt payments in April 2009, fund our acquisition of certain ethanol plants from VeraSun, and maintain our capital investment program. In April and May of 2009, we acquired seven ethanol plants and a site under development from VeraSun for $477 million, plus $79 million primarily for inventory and certain other working capital. The new ethanol business reported $165 million of operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009. In June 2009, we sold in a public offering 46 million shares of our common stock at a price of $18.00 per share and received proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of $799 million. 29 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2009 Compared to 2008 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2009 (a) (b) 2008

following notes relate to references on pages 30 through 34. (a) The information presented for 2009 includes the operations related to certain ethanol plants acquired from VeraSun during 2009. On April 1, 2009, we closed on the acquisition of ethanol plants located in Charles City, Fort Dodge, and Hartley, Iowa; Aurora, South Dakota; and Welcome, Minnesota; and through subsequent closings on April 9, 2009 and May 8, 2009, we acquired ethanol plants in Albert City, Iowa and Albion, Nebraska. The ethanol production volumes reflected for the year ended December 31, 2009 are based on 365 calendar days rather than the actual daily production, which varied by facility. (b) Due to the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery during the fourth quarter of 2009, the results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery, as well as costs associated with the shutdown, are reported as discontinued operations for 2009 and 2008, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Northeast Region, exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years. (c) Effective July 1, 2008, we sold our Krotz Springs Refinery to Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc. (Alon). The nature and significance of our post-closing participation in an offtake agreement with Alon represents a continuation of activities with the Krotz Springs Refinery for accounting purposes, and as such the results of operations related to the Krotz Springs Refinery have not been presented as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Gulf Coast region, include the Krotz Springs Refinery for the year ended December 31, 2008. The pre-tax gain of $305 million on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery is included in the Gulf Coast operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 but is excluded from the per-barrel operating highlights. (d) The asset impairment loss for 2009 relates primarily to the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects classified as “construction in progress” as a result of the unfavorable impact of the continuing economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals. Losses resulting from the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects in 2008 have been reclassified from operating expenses and presented separately for comparability with the 2009 presentation. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel, resulting in an adjustment to the operating costs per barrel previously reported in 2008. (e) Upon applying the goodwill impairment testing criteria under existing accounting rules during the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that the goodwill in all four of our refining segment reporting units was impaired, which resulted in a pre-tax and 34 Table of Contents after-tax goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion related to continuing operations. This goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented for the year ended December 31, 2008 in order to make that information comparable between periods. (f) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (g) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (h) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs (for periods prior to its sale effective July 1, 2008), St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City and Paulsboro Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (i) A loss contingency accrual of $140 million, including interest, was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute with the Government of Aruba regarding a turnover tax on export sales as well as other tax matters. The portion of the loss contingency accrual that relates to the turnover tax of $114 million was recorded in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, and therefore is included in refining operating income (loss) but has been excluded in determining throughput margin per barrel. (j) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials and the corn crush, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services – London Oil Reports. The corn crush represents the posted New York Harbor ethanol price from Oil Price Information Services less the posted corn price from the Chicago Board of Trade and assumes a yield of 2.75 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (k) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues decreased 40% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of lower average refined product prices between the two periods. Operating income declined $819 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the amount for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to an $890 million decrease in refining segment operating income discussed below. Despite the decline in operating income, our income from continuing operations increased from 2008 to 2009 due to a $1.6 billion reduction in income tax expense, largely attributable to the nondeductibility of almost all of the goodwill impairment loss that is included in the 2008 operating income, as discussed further below. Refining Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 to $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in operating income was attributable primarily to a $305 million gain on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery in the third quarter of 2008 (as further discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), a $143 million increase in asset impairment losses (as further discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), a $114 million loss contingency accrual in 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in Aruba (as further discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), a 47% decrease in throughput margin per barrel, and an 8% decline in throughput volumes. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 (as further discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and a 16% decrease in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense). Total refining throughput margins for 2009 compared to 2008 were impacted by the following factors: • Distillate margins in 2009 decreased significantly in all of our refining regions from the margins in 2008. The decrease in distillate margins was primarily due to increased inventory levels and reduced demand attributable to the global slowdown in economic activity. 35 Table of Contents • Sour crude oil and residual fuel oil feedstock differentials to WTI crude oil during 2009 declined significantly compared to the differentials in 2008. The unfavorable sour crude oil differentials were attributable mainly to reduced production of sour crude oil by OPEC and other producers as well as high relative prices for residual fuel oil with which sour crude oil competes as a refinery feedstock. • Gasoline margins increased in all of our refining regions in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a better balance of supply and demand. • Margins on various secondary refined products such as asphalt, fuel oils, and petroleum coke improved significantly from 2008 to 2009 as prices for these products did not decrease in proportion to the large decrease in the costs of the feedstocks used to produce them. The price of WTI crude oil declined by approximately $38 per barrel, or 38%, from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2009. • Throughput margin for 2008 included approximately $100 million related to the McKee Refinery business interruption insurance settlement discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Throughput volumes decreased 205,000 barrels per day during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to (i) the temporary shutdown of our Aruba Refinery commencing in July 2009, (ii) the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery in July 2008, (iii) unplanned downtime at our St. Charles Refinery, (iv) planned downtime for maintenance at our Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Paulsboro, and Three Rivers Refineries, and (v) economic decisions to reduce throughput at certain of our refineries as a result of unfavorable market conditions. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 22% lower for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a decrease in energy costs, lower maintenance expenses, a reduction in sales and use taxes, and $43 million of operating expenses related to the Krotz Springs Refinery prior to its sale effective July 1, 2008. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 4% from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the completion of new capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This 21% decrease was primarily due to decreased retail fuel margins, partially offset by lower selling expenses, in our U.S. retail operations. Ethanol Ethanol operating income was $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which represents the operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the VeraSun Acquisition subsequent to their acquisition in the second quarter of 2009, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization expense, increased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 mainly due to increases in litigation costs, severance expenses, and acquisition costs, partially offset by reductions in environmental costs and professional fees. 36 Table of Contents Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a $128 million unfavorable change in fair value adjustments related to the Alon earn-out agreement and associated derivative instruments (as discussed in Notes 2, 17, and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), reduced interest income resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates, and the nonrecurrence of a $14 million gain recognized in 2008 on the redemption of our 9.5% senior notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These decreases were partially offset by a $55 million increase in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets and $27 million of income in 2009 resulting from the reversal of an accrual for potential payments related to the UDS Acquisition due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. Interest and debt expense increased mainly due to interest incurred on $1 billion of debt issued in March 2009. Income tax expense decreased $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion of expense in 2008 to a $97 million benefit in 2009 mainly as a result of lower operating income in 2009 and the nondeductibility of almost all of the $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss included in the 2008 results of operations, as discussed above. Excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss on the effective tax rate for 2008, our 2009 effective tax rate was lower than 2008 primarily due to a higher percentage of the pre-tax loss being attributable to the Aruba Refinery in 2009, the profits or losses of which are not taxed through December 31, 2010. “Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” increased $1.5 billion from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the after-tax effect of the following changes in the results of operations related to the Delaware City Refinery: (i) a $1.9 billion loss related to the permanent shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009, (ii) a $360 million increase in asset impairment losses, and (iii) a $260 million increase in operating losses. The shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery is discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 37 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars,

following notes relate to references on pages 38 through 41. (a) Due to the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery during the fourth quarter of 2009, the results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery are reported as discontinued operations for 2008 and 2007, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Northeast Region, exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years. (b) Effective July 1, 2008, we sold our Krotz Springs Refinery to Alon. The nature and significance of our post-closing participation in an offtake agreement with Alon represents a continuation of activities with the Krotz Springs Refinery for accounting purposes, and as such the results of operations related to the Krotz Springs Refinery have not been presented as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Gulf Coast region, include the Krotz Springs Refinery for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The pre-tax gain of $305 million on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery is included in the Gulf Coast operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 but is excluded from the per-barrel operating highlights. (c) Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky Refining Company (Husky). Therefore, the results of operations of the Lima Refinery for the six months of 2007 prior to its sale, as well as the gain on the sale of the refinery, are reported as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid-Continent region, exclude the Lima Refinery. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $827 million ($426 million after tax), which is included in “Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” for the year ended December 31, 2007. (d) Losses resulting from the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects in 2008 have been reclassified from operating expenses and presented separately for comparability with the 2009 presentation. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel, resulting in an adjustment to the operating costs per barrel previously reported in 2008. (e) Upon applying the goodwill impairment testing criteria under existing accounting rules during the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that the goodwill in all four of our refining segment reporting units was impaired, which resulted in a pre-tax and after-tax goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion related to continuing operations. This goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented for the year ended December 31, 2008 in order to make that information comparable between periods. (f) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. 41 Table of Contents (g) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (h) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs (for periods prior to its sale effective July 1, 2008), St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City and Paulsboro Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (i) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services – London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (j) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues increased 26% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices. Offsetting the higher revenues were substantially higher average feedstock costs. Operating income decreased $5.9 billion, or 89%, and income from continuing operations decreased $5.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to a $6.1 billion decrease in refining segment operating income. The decrease was primarily due to a goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion related to continuing operations that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 as discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and regional operating income amounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 for comparability purposes. The refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 exclude (i) the operations of the Lima Refinery and the gain on its sale effective July 1, 2007 and (ii) the operations of the Delaware City Refinery due to its permanent shutdown in November 2009, which are both classified as discontinued operations as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $7.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting mainly from the $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above, an 11% decrease in throughput margin per barrel, a 10% increase in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense), and a 5% decline in throughput volumes. These decreases were partially offset by a $305 million gain on the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery effective July 1, 2008, which is discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Total refining throughput margins for 2008 compared to 2007 were impacted by the following factors: • Distillate margins in 2008 increased in all of our refining regions from the margins in 2007. The increase in distillate margins was primarily due to strong global demand. • Gasoline margins decreased significantly in all of our refining regions in 2008 compared to the margins in 2007. The decline in gasoline margins was primarily due to a decrease in gasoline demand and an increase in ethanol production. • Margins on various secondary refined products such as asphalt, fuel oils, propylene, and petroleum coke declined from 2007 to 2008 as prices for these products did not increase in proportion to the large increase in the costs of the feedstocks used to produce them. 42 Table of Contents • Sour crude oil feedstock differentials to WTI crude oil in 2008 remained favorable and were wider than the differentials in 2007. These favorable differentials were attributable to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for gasoline and diesel. • Throughput volumes decreased 130,000 barrels per day during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a fire in the vacuum unit at our Aruba Refinery in January of 2008, downtime for maintenance at our Port Arthur Refinery, unplanned downtime at our Port Arthur, Texas City, St. Charles, and Houston Refineries related to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery, and economic decisions to reduce throughputs in certain of our refineries as a result of unfavorable market fundamentals, partially offset by the 2007 shutdown of our McKee Refinery discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Throughput margin in 2008 included approximately $100 million related to the McKee Refinery business interruption insurance settlement discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased $0.61 per barrel, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating expenses increased mainly due to an increase in energy costs. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 10% from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This 48% increase in operating income was primarily attributable to a $0.055 per gallon increase in retail fuel margins and increased in-store sales in our U.S. retail operations. The significant improvement in fuel margins was largely the result of rapidly declining crude oil prices in the second half of 2008. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, decreased $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily due to lower variable incentive compensation expenses combined with the nonrecurrence of 2007 expenses related to executive retirement costs and a $13 million termination fee paid for the cancellation of our services agreement with NuStar Energy L.P. Other income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to a $91 million foreign currency exchange rate gain in 2007 resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary, reduced interest income resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates, and a reduction in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets. These decreases were partially offset by income related to the Alon earn-out agreement discussed in Notes 2, 17, and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, lower costs incurred under our accounts receivable sales program, an increase in earnings from our equity investment in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company, and a $14 million gain in 2008 on the redemption of our 9.5% senior notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense decreased primarily due to reduced interest on tax liabilities, partially offset by higher average debt balances. 43 Table of Contents Income tax expense decreased $520 million from 2007 to 2008 mainly as a result of lower operating income, excluding the effect on operating income of the $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above that has an insignificant tax effect. Excluding this goodwill impairment loss, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was comparable to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007. “Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” for the year ended December 31, 2008 represents a $119 million net loss on the operations of the Delaware City Refinery, which was reclassified to discontinued operations as a result of the permanent shutdown of the refinery effective November 20, 2009. “Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” for the year ended December 31, 2007 represents a $426 million after-tax gain on the sale of the Lima Refinery effective July 1, 2007, $243 million of net income from the Lima Refinery operations prior to its sale, and $188 million of net income from the operations of the Delaware City Refinery. OUTLOOK High crude oil prices in 2008 and a severe economic recession in 2008 and 2009 caused a large reduction in demand for refined products over the past two years. This demand reduction plus the addition of new refining capacity around the world have resulted in a significant amount of excess global refining capacity, which led to an increase in global refined product inventories and lower refined product margins. In addition, the decrease in demand for refined products contributed to lower production of sour crude oil versus sweet crude oil, which narrowed the differentials between sour and sweet crude oil prices. As 2010 progresses, we expect the United States and worldwide economies to begin to recover, and we expect refined product demand to begin to grow accordingly. The increase in anticipated refined product demand is expected to result in an increase in crude oil production, which we believe will result in the production of more sour crude oils. These expected increases in refined product demand and sour crude oil production should result in improved refined product margins and sour crude oil differentials. However, improvements in refined product margins and sour crude oil differentials are expected to be significantly constrained during 2010 by the start-up of new worldwide refining capacity that will mitigate the reduction in spare capacity that would otherwise result from the improved demand. Until the economy recovers and demand improves, we expect that the current low refined product margins and sour crude oil differentials will result in production constraints or refinery shutdowns in the refining industry. In July, we temporarily shut down our Aruba Refinery due to poor economics resulting from the current unfavorable industry fundamentals. The Aruba Refinery continues to be shut down temporarily, and it is expected to remain shut down until industry conditions improve. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery. We are currently monitoring, and will continue to monitor, all of our other refineries to assess whether complete or partial shutdown of certain of those facilities is appropriate until conditions improve. We expect that refinery production cutbacks and shutdowns of less profitable refineries will occur throughout the refining industry during 2010 until industry conditions improve. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.8 billion compared to $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the $4.4 billion decrease in operating income discussed above under “Results of Operations,” after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss, asset 44 Table of Contents impairment losses, and gain on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery, all of which had no effect on cash flows from operating activities. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.6 billion favorable change in the amount of income tax payments and refunds in 2008 and 2009 and a net $1.4 billion favorable effect from changes in receivables, inventories, and accounts payable in the two years. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2009 due to a significant increase in gasoline, distillate, and crude oil prices at December 31, 2009 compared to such prices at the end of 2008. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2009, combined with $998 million of proceeds from the issuance of $1 billion of notes in March 2009 as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $799 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 46 million shares of common stock in June 2009 as discussed in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $100 million of additional proceeds from the sale of receivables, and $115 million of available cash on hand were used mainly to: • fund $2.7 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • fund the VeraSun Acquisition for $556 million; • make long-term note repayments of $285 million; and • pay common stock dividends of $324 million. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.1 billion compared to $5.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under “Results of Operations,” after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss included in the 2008 operating income that had no effect on cash. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable decreased in 2008 due to a significant decrease in crude oil and refined product prices at December 31, 2008 compared to such prices at the end of 2007. Receivables for 2008 also decreased due to the termination in the first quarter of 2008 of certain agreements related to the sale of the Lima Refinery to Husky and the timing of receivable collections at year-end 2007. The change in working capital for 2007 includes a $900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales facility. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2008, combined with $1.5 billion of available cash on hand and $463 million of proceeds from the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery, were used mainly to: • fund $3.3 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • make an early redemption of our 9.5% senior notes for $367 million and scheduled debt repayments of $7 million; • purchase 23.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $955 million; • fund a $25 million contingent earn-out payment in connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery, an $87 million acquisition of retail fuel sites, and a $57 million acquisition primarily of an interest in a refined product pipeline; and • pay common stock dividends of $299 million. 45 Table of Contents Cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Delaware City Refinery and the Lima Refinery have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statements of cash flows for all years presented and are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities: Delaware City Refinery $ (126 ) $ 81 $ 348 Lima Refinery – – 260 Cash used in investing activities: Delaware City Refinery (153 ) (268 ) (130 ) Lima Refinery – – (14 ) Capital Investments During the year ended December 31, 2009, we expended $2.3 billion for capital expenditures and $415 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $390 million of costs related to environmental projects. For 2010, we expect to incur approximately $2.0 billion for capital investments, including approximately $1.5 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $795 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $510 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. In January 2010, we acquired two ethanol plants from ASA Ethanol Holdings, LLC for a total purchase price of approximately $200 million. The plants are located in Linden, Indiana and Bloomingburg, Ohio. In February 2010, we acquired an additional ethanol plant located near Jefferson, Wisconsin from Renew Energy LLC for $72 million plus certain receivables and inventories.

In March 2009, we issued $750 million of 9.375% notes due March 15, 2019 and $250 million of 10.5% notes due March 15, 2039. Proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled $998 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and other issuance costs of $8 million. 46 Table of Contents On April 1, 2009, we made scheduled debt repayments of $200 million related to our 3.5% notes and $9 million related to our 5.125% Series 1997D industrial revenue bonds. On October 15, 2009, we redeemed $76 million of our $100 million of 6.75% senior notes with a maturity date of October 15, 2037 as further discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables. We amended our agreement in June 2009 to extend the maturity date to June 2010. As of December 31, 2008, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party entities and financial institutions was $100 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold additional eligible receivables under this program of $950 million and repaid $850 million. As of December 31, 2009, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party entities and financial institutions was $200 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we have reduced the net eligible receivables sold under this program by $100 million, resulting in a current balance of $100 million of eligible receivables sold to the third-party entities and financial institutions. Proceeds from the sale of receivables under this facility are reflected as debt in our consolidated balance sheets. In February 2010, we issued $400 million of 4.50% notes due in February 2015 and $850 million of 6.125% notes due in February 2020. Proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled approximately $1.24 billion, before deducting underwriting discounts of $8 million, and will be used for general corporate purposes, including the refinancing of debt. Also in February 2010, we called for redemption our 7.50% senior notes with a maturity date of June 15, 2015 for $294 million, or 102.5% of stated value. The redemption date will be March 15, 2010. These notes will have a carrying amount of $296 million as of the redemption date, resulting in a small gain on the redemption. Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. All of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: Rating Agency Rating Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (negative outlook) Moody’s Investors Service Baa2 (negative outlook) Fitch Ratings BBB (negative outlook) We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings. Operating Lease Obligations Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. The operating lease 47 Table of Contents obligations reflected in the table above have been reduced by related obligations that are included in “other long-term liabilities.” Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short-term and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2009, our short-term and long-term purchase obligations increased by $9.3 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2008. The increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008. Other Long-term Liabilities Our other long-term liabilities are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2009. Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2009, our committed lines of credit were as follows: Borrowing Capacity Expiration Letter of credit facility $300 million June 2010 Revolving credit facility $2.4 billion November 2012 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn. $115 million December 2012 In October 2009, Aurora Bank FSB (Aurora, formerly Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB), one of the participating banks under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, failed to fund its loan commitment related to our borrowing under this facility. Aurora’s aggregate commitment under the revolving credit facility was $84 million. As a result, our borrowing capacity under that revolving credit facility was effectively reduced to $2.4 billion. In June 2008, we entered into a one-year committed revolving letter of credit facility under which we may obtain letters of credit of up to $300 million to support certain of our crude oil purchases. In June 2009, we amended this agreement to extend the maturity date to June 2010. We are being charged letter of credit issuance fees in connection with this letter of credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities. However, we had $259 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities, $299 million of letters of credit outstanding under our two U.S. committed revolving credit facilities, and Cdn. $22 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Canadian committed revolving credit facility. These letters of credit expire during 2010 and 2011. 48 Table of Contents Common Stock Offering On June 3, 2009, we sold in a public offering 46 million shares of our common stock, which included 6 million shares related to an overallotment option exercised by the underwriters, at a price of $18.00 per share and received proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of $799 million. Stock Purchase Programs As of December 31, 2009, we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately $3.5 billion of our common stock. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2009, we contributed $72 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.80% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2009, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 97% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2009. We have less than $1 million of minimum required contributions to our Qualified Plans during 2010 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; however, we plan to contribute approximately $50 million to our Qualified Plans during 2010, of which $30 million was contributed during February 2010. Environmental Matters As discussed in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Currently, some of the proposed federal “cap-and-trade” legislation would require businesses that emit greenhouse gases to buy emission credits from the government, other businesses, or through an auction process. In addition, refiners would be obligated to purchase emission credits associated with the transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) sold and consumed in the United States. As a result of such a program, we would be required to purchase emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our own operations as well as from the fuels we sell. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final form of a cap-and-trade bill (or whether such a bill will be passed by Congress), any new federal restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions – including a cap-and-trade program – could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Tax Matters As discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive tax liabilities. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. 49 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2007, the Government of Aruba (GOA) enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods produced and services rendered in Aruba. The turnover tax, which initially was 3% for on-island sales and services (but has subsequently been reduced to 1.5%) and 1% on export sales, is being assessed by the GOA on sales by our Aruba Refinery. We disputed the GOA’s assessment of the turnover tax in arbitration proceedings with the Netherlands Arbitration Institute (NAI) pursuant to which we sought to enforce our rights under a tax holiday agreement related to the refinery and other agreements. The arbitration hearing was held on February 3-4, 2009. We also filed protests of these assessments through proceedings in Aruba. In April 2008, we entered into an escrow agreement with the GOA and Caribbean Mercantile Bank NV (CMB), pursuant to which we agreed to deposit an amount equal to the disputed turnover tax on exports into an escrow account with CMB, pending resolution of the tax protest proceedings in Aruba. Under this escrow agreement, we are required to continue to deposit an amount equal to the disputed tax on a monthly basis until the tax dispute is resolved through the Aruba proceedings. On April 20, 2009, we were notified that the Aruban tax court overruled our protests with respect to the turnover tax assessed in January and February 2007, totaling $8 million. Under the escrow agreement, we expensed and paid $8 million, plus $1 million of interest, to the GOA in the second quarter of 2009. Amounts deposited under the escrow agreement, which totaled $115 million and $102 million as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, are reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition to the turnover tax described above, the GOA has asserted other tax amounts including approximately $35 million related to various dividends. We also challenged approximately $35 million in foreign exchange payments made to the Central Bank of Aruba as payments exempted under our tax holiday, as well as other reasons. Both the dividend tax and the foreign exchange payment matters were also addressed in the arbitration proceedings discussed above. On November 3, 2009, we received an interim First Partial Award from the NAI arbitral panel. The panel’s ruling validated our tax holiday agreement, but the panel also ruled in favor of the GOA on our dispute of the $35 million in foreign exchange payments previously made to the Central Bank of Aruba. The panel’s decision did not, however, fully resolve the remaining two items in the arbitration, the applicable dividend tax rate and the turnover tax. With respect to the dividend tax, the panel ruled that the dividend tax was not a profit tax covered by the tax holiday agreement, but the panel did not address the fact that Aruban companies with tax holidays are subject to a 0% dividend withholding rate rather than the 5% rate alleged by the GOA. With respect to the turnover tax, the panel did reject our contractual claims but it decided that our non-contractual claims against the turnover tax merited further discussion with and review by the panel before a final decision could be rendered. Prior to this interim decision, no expense or liability had been recognized in our consolidated financial statements with respect to unfunded amounts. In light of the uncertain timing of any final resolution of these claims as a result of the First Partial Award from the panel, we recorded a loss contingency accrual of approximately $140 million, including interest, with respect to both the dividend and turnover taxes. Following the November ruling, we entered into settlement discussions with the GOA. On February 24, 2010, we signed a settlement agreement that details the parties’ proposed terms for settlement of these disputes and provides a framework for taxation of our operations in Aruba on a go-forward basis as our tax holiday was set to expire on December 31, 2010. Under the proposed settlement, we will make a payment to the GOA of $118 million in consideration of a full release of all tax claims prior to the effective date of the settlement, including the turnover tax disputed in the Netherlands Arbitration. The GOA will eliminate the turnover tax on exports as of the effective date of the settlement. In addition, we will agree to exit the Tax Holiday regime following the effective date of the settlement agreement and will enter into a new tax regime under which we will be subject to a net profit tax of less than 10% on an overall basis. Beginning on the second anniversary of the settlement agreement’s effective date, we will also begin to make an annual prepayment of taxes of $10 million, with the ability to carry forward any 50 Table of Contents excess tax prepayments to future tax years. The proposed settlement will not be effective until the settlement agreement is approved by the Aruban Parliament and certain laws and regulations are modified and/or established to provide for the terms of the settlement. The parties anticipate that this will occur on or before June 1, 2010. If the settlement is not effective as of June 1, 2010, we both have the right to terminate the settlement agreement and return to arbitration and the on-island proceedings to continue litigation. Other Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long-lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method investments, and deferred tax assets) are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the 51 Table of Contents carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment evaluations and certain losses resulting from those evaluations. Due to the effect of the current unfavorable economic conditions on the refining industry, and our expectations of a continuation of such conditions for the near term, we will continue to monitor both our operating assets and our capital projects for additional potential asset impairments until conditions improve. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions, as well as changes in assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair values and changes in potential asset sales proceeds, could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that management deems to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. Environmental Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, such as potential cap-and-trade legislation as discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Environmental Matters,” could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes. The balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 is included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 52 Table of Contents Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that each receive one of the two highest ratings given by the recognized rating agencies as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2009 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2010 (in millions): Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Increase in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease $ 61 $ 14 Compensation rate increase 27 – Health care cost trend rate increase – 10 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease 8 1 Expected return on plan assets decrease 4 – Compensation rate increase 6 – Health care cost trend rate increase – 1 See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Tax Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the 53 Table of Contents sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. See Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities. Legal Liabilities A variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. See Note 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our litigation matters. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil, refined product, and grain prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use commodity derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). From time to time, we use commodity derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). We also use commodity derivative instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in income. Finally, we enter into commodity derivative instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. See “Derivatives and Hedging” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures, and options. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. The following tables provide information about our commodity derivative instruments as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including: Fair Value Hedges – Fair value hedges are used to hedge certain refining inventories (which had a carrying amount of $4.4 billion as of both December 31, 2009 and 2008, and a fair value of $8.9 billion and $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively) and our unrecognized firm commitments (i.e., binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future). The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period. 54 Table of Contents Cash Flow Hedges – Cash flow hedges are used to hedge certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. Economic Hedges – Economic hedges are hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges that are used to: – manage price volatility in refinery feedstock, refined product, and grain inventories; and – manage price volatility in forecasted refinery feedstock, product, and grain purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. In addition, through August 2009, we used economic hedges to manage price volatility in the referenced product margins associated with the three-year earn-out agreement with Alon that was entered into in connection with the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery, but which was settled in the third quarter of 2009 as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The derivative instruments related to economic hedges are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. Trading Activities – These represent commodity derivative instruments held or issued for trading purposes. The derivative instruments entered into by us for trading activities are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. The following tables include only open positions at the end of the reporting period. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products), in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas), or in thousands of bushels (for grain). The weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products), amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas), or amounts per bushel (for grain). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. For futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period-end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. The pre-tax fair value for futures, swaps, and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. The pre-tax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the pre-tax fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options represents their strike price. 55 Table of Contents December 31, 2009 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Pre-tax Contract Pay Receive

relates to our debt obligations. We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. In addition, we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged are recorded in interest expense. The recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and debt balances are adjusted accordingly. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. The following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented.

Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. As of December 31, 2009, we had commitments to purchase $456 million of U.S. dollars and commitments to sell $604 million of U.S. dollars. These commitments matured on or before February 1, 2010, resulting in a $3 million loss in the first quarter of 2010. 59 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:45:01.029793

1035002,VLO,VALERO ENERGY CORP/TX,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following review of the results of operations and financial condition of Valero should be read in conjunction with Items 1 & 2, “Business & Properties,” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” included in this report. In the discussions that follow, all per-share amounts assume dilution. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10-K, including without limitation the discussion below under the heading “Results of Operations - Outlook,” contains certain estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions and other “forward-looking statements” (as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that involve various risks and uncertainties. While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect Valero’s current judgment regarding the direction of its business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested in this report. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “may” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding: • future refining margins, including gasoline and heating oil margins; • future retail margins, including gasoline, diesel, home heating oil and convenience store merchandise margins; • expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil discounts, and operating expenses; • anticipated levels of crude oil and refined product inventories; • Valero’s anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred refinery turnaround and catalyst costs and capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and the effect of those capital investments on Valero’s results of operations; • anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products in the United States, Canada and elsewhere; • expectations regarding environmental and other regulatory initiatives; and • the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining and retail industry fundamentals. Valero’s forward-looking statements are based on its beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time the statements are made. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • acts of terrorism aimed at either Valero’s facilities or other facilities that could impair Valero’s ability to produce and/or transport refined products or receive feedstocks; • political conditions in crude oil producing regions, including the Middle East and South America; • the domestic and foreign supplies of refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil and petrochemicals; • the domestic and foreign supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks; • the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls; • the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations; • refinery overcapacity or undercapacity; • the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and the expansion and retirement of refining capacity in response to market conditions; • environmental and other regulations at both the state and federal levels and in foreign countries; 25 Table of Contents • the level of foreign imports of refined products; • accidents or other unscheduled shutdowns affecting Valero’s refineries, machinery, pipelines or equipment, or those of Valero’s suppliers or customers; • changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined products; • the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles; • cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects; • earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products; • rulings, judgments or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage; • the introduction or enactment of federal or state legislation which may adversely affect Valero’s business or operations; • changes in the credit ratings assigned to Valero’s debt securities and trade credit; • changes in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar; and • overall economic conditions. Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect Valero’s future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Valero’s forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. Valero does not intend to update these statements unless it is required by the securities laws to do so. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Valero or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. Valero undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 26 Table of Contents OVERVIEW Generally, Valero’s operations are affected by: • company-specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance turnarounds, • seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products, and • industry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices including the effect of quality differential between grades of crude oil, the demand for and prices of refined products, industry supply capacity, and competitor refinery maintenance turnarounds. Valero’s profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the “refined product margin.” Since approximately 50% of Valero’s total throughput represents sour crude oil feedstocks, Valero’s profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the “sour crude oil discount.” For the year 2004, both refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts were the best ever experienced by Valero. The strength of those positive industry fundamentals significantly enhanced Valero’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, resulting in earnings per share of $6.53. This represented a 156% increase over the $2.55 per share earnings reported for 2003, as adjusted to reflect the effect of a two-for-one stock split discussed below. Valero’s operating results during 2004 benefited significantly from recent investments that increased Valero’s capacity to process lower-cost feedstocks. In March 2004, Valero continued its strategic growth through the acquisition of the Aruba Refinery and related marine, bunkering and marketing operations. The Aruba Refinery, which processes heavy, sour crude oil, contributed approximately $290 million to Valero’s operating income for 2004. In addition, the 45,000 BPD coker unit at the Texas City Refinery, which began operations late in the fourth quarter of 2003 and also processes heavier, lower-cost crude oil, generated nearly $200 million of operating income in 2004. Furthermore, during 2004, Valero realized the benefits from a full year of operations of the St. Charles Refinery that was acquired on July 1, 2003. The St. Charles Refinery generated approximately $335 million of operating income in 2004. The positive 2004 results from Valero’s operations, as well as certain investing and financing activities during 2004, significantly improved Valero’s financial position and are expected to favorably position Valero to meet its objectives of increased shareholder return, continued growth and improved earnings stability. Valero’s debt-to-capitalization ratio (net of cash) decreased from approximately 40% at December 31, 2003 to 30.7% at the end of 2004. During 2004, Valero’s debt-to-capitalization ratio was positively impacted by the generation of $3.0 billion of cash from operating activities and the sale of 15.6 million shares of common stock which partially funded the Aruba Acquisition. As discussed further under “Outlook” below, Valero’s increasing ability to process heavier sour crude oils is expected to enable Valero to further benefit from wide sour crude oil discounts that Valero believes will occur. Valero believes that it is well-positioned to benefit from an expected continuation of favorable refining industry fundamentals. On July 15, 2004, Valero’s board of directors approved a two-for-one split of Valero’s common stock, which was distributed in the form of a stock dividend on October 7, 2004 to stockholders of record on September 23, 2004. All share and per share data (except par value) in this Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock split for all periods presented. 27 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2004 Compared to 2003 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2004 (a) 2003 (b) Change Operating revenues (c) $ 54,618.6 $ 37,968.6 $ 16,650.0 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales (c) 47,797.3 33,587.1 14,210.2 Refining operating expenses 2,140.2 1,656.0 484.2 Retail selling expenses 704.7 693.6 11.1 General and administrative expenses 378.8 299.4 79.4 Depreciation and amortization expense: Refining 518.6 417.1 101.5 Retail 57.8 39.6 18.2 Corporate 42.0 53.8 (11.8 ) Total costs and expenses 51,639.4 36,746.6 14,892.8 Operating income 2,979.2 1,222.0 1,757.2 Equity in earnings of Valero L.P.

(a) Includes the operations related to the Aruba Acquisition commencing on March 5, 2004. (b) Includes the operations of the St. Charles Refinery commencing on July 1, 2003. (c) Operating revenues and cost of sales both include approximately $4.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, and approximately $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, related to certain crude oil buy/sell arrangements, as further discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) On March 18, 2003, Valero’s ownership interest in Valero L.P. decreased from 73.6% to 49.5%. As a result of this decrease in ownership of Valero L.P. combined with certain other partnership governance changes, Valero ceased consolidating Valero L.P. as of that date and began using the equity method to account for its investment in the partnership. (e) Total throughput volumes and throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast region for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, are based on 366 days and 365 days, respectively, which results in 183,000 barrels per day and 99,000 barrels per day being included for the Aruba Refinery in 2004 and the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, respectively. Throughput volumes for the Aruba Refinery for the 302 days of its operations during 2004 averaged 221,000 barrels per day. Throughput volumes for the St. Charles Refinery for the 184 days of its operations during 2003 averaged 197,000 barrels per day. (f) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (g) The Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles and Aruba Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore and Denver Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec and Paulsboro Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (h) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platt’s Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services-London Oil Reports. The CARBOB 87 gasoline differential for 2003 represents CARB 87 gasoline, which includes MTBE as a blending component, for the periods prior to October 31, 2003. Prices for products meeting these specifications ceased to be available after October 31, 2003. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect Valero’s operations and profitability. (i) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. 31 Table of Contents General Operating revenues increased 44% from the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations. The increases in operating income from $1.2 billion for 2003 to $3.0 billion for 2004 and net income from $621.5 million for 2003 to $1.8 billion for 2004 were attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for Valero’s refining segment as discussed below. Refining Operating income for Valero’s refining segment was $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $1.9 billion from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in refining segment operating income resulted primarily from a 45% increase in refining throughput margin per barrel and an 18% increase in refining throughput volumes, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Refining total throughput margin for 2004 increased due to the following factors: • Discounts on Valero’s sour crude oil feedstocks improved during 2004 compared to 2003 due to ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. In addition, discounts on sour crude oil feedstocks benefited from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from several factors, including (i) the global movement to cleaner fuels, which has required refineries to lower the sulfur content of the gasoline they produce, (ii) high gasoline margins, which increased the demand for sweet versus sour crude oil due to the higher gasoline content of sweet crude oil, and (iii) a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which has resulted in more gasoline production by less complex foreign refineries that require sweet crude oil as feedstock. • Gasoline margins increased in all of Valero’s refining regions during 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to strong demand. Gasoline demand was up in 2004 primarily due to strong U.S. and global economic activity. • Distillate margins also increased in all of Valero’s refining regions in 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to increased foreign and U.S. demand resulting from improved economies. • Petrochemical feedstock margins improved significantly in 2004 compared to 2003 due to increased demand for such feedstocks resulting from a stronger worldwide economy. • Valero’s throughput volumes increased 327,000 barrels per day in 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to incremental throughput of 117,000 barrels per day at the St. Charles Refinery, which was acquired in July 2003, and 183,000 barrels per day of throughput at the Aruba Refinery during the partial period commencing on its acquisition date of March 5, 2004. The above increases in throughput margin for 2004 were partially offset by the effects of: • lower margins on products such as asphalt, No. 6 fuel oil, sulfur and petroleum coke due to an increase in the price of crude oil in 2004 compared to 2003, • an approximate $20 million reduction resulting from Valero ceasing consolidation of Valero L.P. commencing in March 2003, • a higher level of turnaround activity in 2004 compared to 2003, and • approximately $231 million of hedging losses in 2004 related to forward sales of distillates and associated crude oil purchases. Refining operating expenses were 29% higher for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 due primarily to the acquisitions of the St. Charles Refinery in July 2003 and the Aruba Refinery in March 2004, higher energy costs (primarily related to an increase in natural gas prices), increased maintenance expense, an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense including increased variable and incentive compensation, and increases in insurance expense, injected catalyst, 32 Table of Contents professional fees and regulatory costs. Although total refining operating expenses increased 29% from 2003 to 2004, this increase was 9% on a per-barrel basis. The lower percentage increase on a per-barrel basis was due to the throughput increases that resulted from the St. Charles and Aruba Acquisitions. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24% from the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2004 due mainly to the implementation of new capital projects, the acquisitions of the St. Charles and Aruba Refineries and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $175.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $36.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. Retail fuel margins in the United States decreased due to a rise in crude oil prices during 2004 which could not be fully passed through to the consumer, and fuel sales declined in the United States due to fewer stores. Retail depreciation and amortization expense was higher in 2004 due mainly to gains recognized in 2003 on the disposition of certain home heating oil businesses and service stations. In the Northeast, operating income declined due mainly to an increase in selling expenses resulting primarily from a significant increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate from 2003 to 2004. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Employee compensation and benefits increased approximately $41 million from 2003 to 2004, including the recognition of increased variable and incentive compensation expense of approximately $21 million as a result of improved financial performance between the respective years. The remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to costs related to legal and regulatory matters and increased charitable contributions. Equity in earnings of Valero L.P. represents Valero’s equity interest in the earnings of Valero L.P. after March 18, 2003. On March 18, 2003, Valero’s ownership interest in Valero L.P. decreased from 73.6% to 49.5%. As a result of this decrease in ownership of Valero L.P. combined with certain other partnership governance changes, Valero ceased consolidating Valero L.P. as of that date and began using the equity method to account for its investment in Valero L.P. The minority interest in net income of Valero L.P. represented the minority unitholders’ share of the net income of Valero L.P. during the periods that Valero consolidated such operations. “Other income (expense), net” for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes an impairment charge of $57.2 million to write off the carrying amount of Valero’s equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P., as further described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the effect of this impairment charge, other income declined $6.0 million due primarily to the nonrecurrence of a $17.0 million gain recognized in 2003 related to the sale of certain notes received as partial consideration for the 2002 sale of the Golden Eagle Business (described further in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by a $10 million increase in equity income in 2004 from the Javelina joint venture due to higher natural gas liquids prices. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts ceased during 2003 due to the redemption of the 8.32% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (TOPrS) in June 2003 and the settlement of the Premium Equity Participating Security Units (PEPS Units) in August 2003. Income tax expense increased $541.2 million from 2003 to 2004 mainly as a result of a 175% increase in income before income tax expense. Valero’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004, 33 Table of Contents however, decreased from the year ended December 31, 2003 due mainly to the Aruba Acquisition, the results of operations of which are substantially non-taxable in Aruba through December 31, 2010. 2003 Compared to 2002 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2003 (a) 2002 Change Operating revenues (b) $ 37,968.6 $ 29,047.9 $ 8,920.7 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales (b) 33,587.1 25,863.2 7,723.9 Refining operating expenses 1,656.0 1,331.6 324.4 Retail selling expenses 693.6 674.5 19.1 General and administrative expenses 299.4 258.4 41.0 Depreciation and amortization expense: Refining 417.1 388.3 28.8 Retail 39.6 43.1 (3.5 ) Corporate 53.8 17.9 35.9 Total costs and expenses 36,746.6 28,577.0 8,169.6 Operating income 1,222.0 470.9 751.1 Equity in earnings of Valero L.P.

The increases in operating income from $470.9 million for 2002 to $1.2 billion for 2003 and net income from $91.5 million for 2002 to $621.5 million for 2003 were attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for Valero’s refining segment as discussed below. Refining Operating income for Valero’s refining segment was $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $744.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in refining segment operating income resulted primarily from a 28% increase in refining throughput margin per barrel and a 15% increase in refining throughput volumes, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Refining total throughput margin for 2003 increased due to the following factors: • Gasoline and distillate margins improved significantly during 2003 compared to 2002 due to stronger demand and lower inventory levels. Demand for distillates improved significantly in 2003 due to colder winter weather in the Northeast and fuel switching demand in early 2003 caused by high natural gas prices. Refined product inventories were lower than the inventory levels that existed during most of 2002 due to the stronger demand combined with lower refinery production rates resulting from a large number of maintenance turnarounds in the refining industry in the first quarter of 2003 and the continuing impact of the oil workers’ strike in Venezuela in early 2003, which also reduced production rates. The high inventory levels in 2002 were caused by weaker economic conditions, an unusually warm winter in the northeastern part of the United States and in Europe, and lower jet fuel demand. • Discounts on Valero’s sour crude oil feedstocks increased for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 due mainly to the resumption of higher crude oil production rates by OPEC. • Valero’s throughput volumes for 2003 increased from 2002 due to incremental volumes from the St. Charles Refinery commencing in July 2003 and increased refinery utilization rates during 2003, as eight of Valero’s refineries were affected by turnaround activities during 2002. Also during 2002, production at several refineries was reduced at various times during the year due to uneconomic operating conditions. The above increases in throughput margin for 2003 were partially offset by the effects of: • a net benefit of approximately $76 million in 2002 resulting from the settlement of petroleum products purchase agreements and related hedges, • a $39 million benefit from the liquidation of certain of Valero’s LIFO inventories in 2002, • an approximate $62 million reduction resulting from Valero ceasing consolidation of Valero L.P. commencing in March 2003, and • an increase in unplanned downtime during 2003 at certain of Valero’s refineries. Refining operating expenses were 24% higher for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 due primarily to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery in July 2003, higher energy costs (primarily related to natural gas), an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense including increased variable and incentive compensation, and increased maintenance expense associated with unplanned downtime. Although total operating expenses increased 24%, the increase in refining operating expenses on a per barrel basis was 8% from 2002 to 2003 due to an increase in throughput volumes for the reasons discussed above. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 7% from the year ended 38 Table of Contents December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2003 due mainly to depreciation expense related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $211.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $83.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of higher retail fuel margins in both the U.S. and Northeast retail systems and operational improvements. During 2003, Valero continued to implement its U.S. retail strategy that commenced in 2002 of investing in certain key stores and disposing of certain underperforming or non-strategic stores. During 2003, Valero reimaged and upgraded 150 stores and closed or divested 122 stores. These changes contributed to improved operating income for the retail segment in 2003. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Part of the increase was due to the recognition of increased variable and incentive compensation expense of approximately $21 million in 2003 as a result of improved financial performance in 2003 as compared to 2002. Also, in December 2003, a $25.8 million impairment charge was recognized and reflected in corporate depreciation and amortization expense to write down the carrying amount of Valero’s former headquarters facilities to fair value less selling costs, as described further in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to increases in salary and benefits expenses, ad valorem taxes and litigation costs. Equity in earnings of Valero L.P. represents Valero’s equity interest in the earnings of Valero L.P. after March 18, 2003, the date Valero ceased consolidating Valero L.P. and began using the equity method to account for its investment in Valero L.P. The minority interest in net income of Valero L.P. represented the minority unitholders’ share of the net income of Valero L.P. during the periods that Valero consolidated such operations. The increase in “other income, net” from 2002 to 2003 was due mainly to a gain of $17.0 million related to the sale of notes receivable from Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company (Tesoro) in connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business in 2002. This gain was offset by a $7.1 million decrease in equity income from joint ventures and $4.2 million of expense resulting from the initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation. Net interest and debt expense decreased $24.4 million from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a decrease in debt levels from $5 billion as of December 31, 2002 to $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2003 and an increase in capitalized interest attributable to a larger capital investment program. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts decreased $13.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the redemption of the 8.32% TOPrS in June 2003 and the settlement of the PEPS Units in August 2003. Income tax expense increased from $58.2 million in 2002 to $365.1 million in 2003 due to the significant increase in pre-tax income. 39 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Sour crude oil discounts in January and February 2005 have improved significantly from early 2004 levels and are expected to remain strong throughout 2005. Two primary factors support an expectation of continuing wide sour crude oil discounts. First, a projected increase in the global demand for crude oil in 2005 is expected to result in higher production of medium and heavy sour crude oils. However, global conversion capacity to process this incremental sour crude oil is limited. Lack of conversion capacity will result in higher yields of residual fuel by-product for which demand is declining due to tighter environmental standards. Sour crude oil discounts will stay wide to justify the yield of low-value resid in low-conversion refineries. Refineries with conversion capacity to upgrade the resid will benefit. Secondly, as refiners seek to meet the requirements of the global movement to cleaner fuels, the demand for sweet crude oils continues to grow due to their higher yield of clean products, leading to increased prices for sweeter crude oils. In addition to the very favorable outlook for sour crude oil discounts, the outlook for refined product margins appears favorable as a result of continued strong demand for both gasoline and diesel. The favorable factors that were in place in 2004 are expected to continue in 2005 as worldwide demand continues to exceed production capacity. In addition, refined product margins should benefit from a further tightening of fuel specifications worldwide, making it more difficult for foreign refiners to meet the U.S. specifications on imports. Operationally, Valero expects to benefit during 2005 from the full-year effect of the Aruba Refinery that was acquired in March 2004 and also expects to benefit from strategic projects that were completed during 2004 and will be completed during 2005, particularly those projects that further Valero’s strategy of processing heavier and more sour feedstocks. For 2005, throughput volume is expected to increase approximately 100,000 BPD compared to 2004. As a result of these factors, Valero believes it is well-positioned to capitalize on the expected positive industry fundamentals and the resulting favorable outlook for refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts during 2005. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $3.0 billion compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $1.2 billion. The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2003 to 2004 was due to the significant increase in income in 2004 as described above under “Results of Operations,” partially offset by a $226.6 million decrease in the amount of favorable working capital changes between the years. As reflected in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the year ended December 31, 2004, working capital requirements decreased by approximately $203 million, largely due to a significant increase in current income tax liabilities, while 2003 benefited primarily from a $350 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under Valero’s accounts receivable sales program. Other significant working capital changes for 2004, which substantially offset each other, included increases in receivables, accounts payable, inventories and taxes other than income taxes. All of these changes were attributable to increases in both throughput volumes and commodity prices from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004. Valero’s cash balance increased by $494.4 million during 2004. 40 Table of Contents In addition to the $3.0 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, Valero generated cash from various other sources during 2004, including proceeds of approximately $406 million from the sale of common stock, approximately $135 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to Valero’s benefit plans, approximately $109 million of proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment, and approximately $64 million of net borrowings (borrowings net of debt repayments). Valero used these proceeds to: • fund $1.6 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • exercise options under structured lease arrangements to purchase $567.1 million of leased property; • fund the Aruba Acquisition for $541.3 million, net of cash acquired; • purchase 9.7 million shares of treasury stock at a cost of $317.4 million; • fund contingent payments in connection with acquisitions of $53.4 million; • invest $35.9 million in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project (described further in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and • pay common and preferred stock dividends of $79.4 million. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $1.8 billion compared to $272.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $1.5 billion. The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2002 to 2003 was due primarily to the significant increase in income in 2003 as described above under “Results of Operations” and changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during 2003 and 2002 as further reflected in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary cause of the change in working capital between the years related to changes in the amount of receivables sold under Valero’s accounts receivable sales program. During 2003, the amount of receivables sold under the program increased by $350 million, while during 2002, working capital was increased by a $123 million decrease in the amount of receivables sold. For the year ended December 31, 2003, in addition to the $350 million increase in the amount of receivables sold, changes in working capital included a $415.8 million increase in accounts payable, which more than offset a $270.0 million increase in inventories. Inventories increased due to higher volumes of feedstock and refined product inventories on hand at December 31, 2003 attributable primarily to (i) lower than normal feedstock levels at December 31, 2002 resulting from the effect of the oil workers’ strike in Venezuela and (ii) increased refinery utilization rates during 2003. In addition to the $1.8 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, Valero generated cash from various other sources during 2003, including proceeds of approximately $300 million from the issuance of senior notes in June, $250.3 million from the issuance of common stock in March, $379.9 million from the contribution and sale of certain assets to Valero L.P., $89.6 million from the sale of Tesoro notes held by Valero, and $94.2 million from the disposition of certain parts of its home heating oil business and other property, plant and equipment. Valero used these proceeds to: • fund $1.1 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • exercise options under certain structured lease arrangements to purchase $275.0 million of property and exercise an option under certain capital leases to purchase for $289.3 million the Corpus Christi East Refinery and related refined product logistics assets; • fund part of the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery for $309.0 million; • redeem the $200 million of TOPrS and $100 million of 8% debentures; • fund a $106.1 million investment in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project, $50.6 million of earn-out payments and approximately $35.0 million of other acquisitions; and • pay common and preferred stock dividends of $50.6 million. 41 Table of Contents The remaining proceeds were used primarily to reduce borrowings under Valero’s committed and uncommitted bank credit facilities. Aruba Acquisition On March 5, 2004, Valero completed the purchase of El Paso Corporation’s Aruba Refinery and related marine, bunkering and marketing operations. Consideration for the purchase consisted of $200 million in existing cash, approximately $27 million in borrowings under Valero’s existing bank credit facilities and approximately $406 million in net proceeds from the sale of 15.6 million shares of Valero common stock. In addition, upon termination on May 4, 2004 of an agreement in existence with a third-party marketing firm on the date of acquisition, Valero paid $67.8 million related to certain refined product inventories owned by the third-party marketing firm. Capital Investments During the year ended December 31, 2004, Valero expended approximately $1.6 billion for capital investments of which $1.3 billion related to capital expenditures (including approximately $523 million for environmental projects and approximately $360 million for strategic projects) and $304.2 million related to deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2004 included approximately $184 million to fund construction of gasoline desulfurization units at the Paulsboro, St. Charles, Quebec, Houston, McKee and Corpus Christi West Refineries in response to Tier II regulations. In addition to the $1.6 billion of capital investments discussed above, $567.1 million was expended for the purchase of various leased properties, which were previously subject to structured lease arrangements (see Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $35.9 million was invested in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project, $53.4 million of payments were made related to the contingent earn-out agreements discussed below and other contingencies related to acquisitions, and $541.3 million of cash was expended on the Aruba Acquisition. In connection with Valero’s acquisitions of Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997 and the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the sellers are entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years and seven years, respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified level (see the discussion in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Any payments due under these earn-out arrangements are limited based on annual and aggregate limits. During 2004, Valero made an earn-out payment of $35.0 million related to the acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc. In January 2005, Valero made an earn-out payment of $50.0 million related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery. Based on estimated margin levels through April 2005, an earn-out payment related to the Basis Petroleum Acquisition of $35 million would be due in May 2005. For 2005, Valero expects to incur approximately $2.0 billion for capital investments, including approximately $1.7 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $900 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $300 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to the contingent earn-out agreements discussed above and strategic acquisitions. Valero continuously evaluates its capital budget and makes changes as economic conditions warrant. In connection with Valero L.P.’s proposed merger of Kaneb Services LLC and Kaneb Pipe Line Partners, L.P., Valero expects to contribute approximately $28 million to Valero L.P. to maintain Valero’s 2% general partner interest in Valero L.P. 42 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Valero’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Long-term debt $ 409.6 $ 259.5 $ 329.0 $ 6.5 $ 208.5 $ 3,163.5 $ 4,376.6 Capital lease obligations 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 3.7 11.2 Operating lease obligations 195.8 169.0 147.1 121.2 87.0 196.4 916.5 Purchase obligations 8,582.1 1,646.3 1,169.1 1,068.8 1,049.4 1,009.8 14,525.5 Total $ 9,189.0 $ 2,076.3 $ 1,646.7 $ 1,198.0 $ 1,346.4 $ 4,373.4 $ 19,829.8 Long-Term Debt Payments for long-term debt are at stated values. On March 22, 2004, Valero issued $200 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due April 1, 2009 and $200 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due April 1, 2014 under its prior shelf registration statement. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under Valero’s revolving bank credit facilities. On March 29, 2004, Valero borrowed $200 million under a five-year term loan with a maturity date of March 31, 2009 and bearing interest based on Valero’s debt rating. Principal payments were scheduled to begin March 2007 with a $50.0 million principal payment due at that time and semi-annual payments of $37.5 million due thereafter until maturity. The net proceeds from this borrowing were used to repay borrowings under Valero’s revolving bank credit facilities. In December 2004, Valero repaid the entire outstanding balance of the term loan. None of Valero’s agreements have rating agency triggers that would automatically require Valero to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of Valero’s senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of Valero’s bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. Operating Lease Obligations Valero’s operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by Valero under subleases. Structured Lease Arrangements During the first quarter of 2004, Valero exercised its option to purchase the leased properties under each of the four structured lease arrangements that existed as of December 31, 2003. Valero purchased the leased properties for $567.1 million, using borrowings under its existing bank credit facilities. Subsequent to this purchase, Valero issued $400 million of Senior Notes and borrowed $200 million under a bank term loan, which are described above under “Long-Term Debt,” to refinance these borrowings under its existing bank credit facilities and to take advantage of favorable treasury rates. Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. Valero has various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply 43 Table of Contents arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements. Valero enters into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities, feedstock and storage to operate its refineries. Substantially all of Valero’s purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on Valero’s usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short-term and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2004, Valero’s short-term and long-term purchase obligations increased by approximately $8.4 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2003. The increase is almost entirely attributable to an increase in obligations under crude oil supply contracts resulting mainly from significantly higher crude oil prices as of December 31, 2004 and new contracts in 2004, including contracts for feedstock to supply the Aruba Refinery which was acquired in March 2004. Valero has not made in the past, nor does it expect to make in the future, payments for feedstock or services that it has not received or will not receive, nor paid prices in excess of then prevailing market conditions. Other Long-term Liabilities Valero’s “other long-term liabilities” are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For most of these liabilities, the timing of the payment of such liabilities is not fixed and therefore cannot be determined as of December 31, 2004. However, certain expected payments related to Valero’s anticipated pension contribution in 2005 and its other postretirement benefit obligations are discussed in Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2004, Valero’s committed lines of credit were as follows (in millions): Borrowing Capacity Expiration 3-year revolving credit facility $ 750.0 December 2006 5-year revolving credit facility $ 750.0 December 2006 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn $ 115.0 July 2005 Valero’s other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2004 were as follows (in millions): Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Total Amounts 2005 2006 2007 Committed Letters of credit $ 503.7 $ — $ 0.1 $ 503.8 As of December 31, 2004, Valero had $218.1 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities, Cdn. $8.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under its Canadian committed revolving credit facility and $278.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under its 3-year and 5-year committed revolving credit facilities. Under Valero’s revolving bank credit facilities’ definitions, Valero’s debt-to-capitalization ratio (net of cash) was 30.7% as of December 31, 2004 compared to 40.3% as of December 31, 2003. Valero’s refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact Valero’s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, Valero believes that its portfolio of accounts 44 Table of Contents receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, Valero has not had any significant problems collecting its accounts receivable. On August 25, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed by Valero to register $3.5 billion of securities for potential future issuance. Valero believes it has sufficient funds from operations, and to the extent necessary, from the public and private capital markets and bank markets, to fund its ongoing operating requirements. Valero expects that, to the extent necessary, it can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms acceptable to Valero. Equity On February 5, 2004, Valero sold in a public offering 15.6 million shares of its common stock, which included 2.0 million shares related to an overallotment option exercised by the underwriter, at a price of $26.63 per share and received proceeds, net of underwriter’s discount, commissions and other issuance costs, of $405.8 million. These shares were issued under Valero’s prior shelf registration statement to partially fund the Aruba Acquisition. Valero purchases shares of its common stock in open market transactions to meet its obligations under employee benefit plans. Valero also purchases shares of its common stock from its employees and non-employee directors in connection with the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock and other stock compensation transactions. During 2004, Valero purchased 9.7 million shares of its common stock under these programs at a cost of $317.4 million. Through February 2005, Valero has purchased an additional 1.4 million common shares under these programs at a cost of $77.6 million. No shares were purchased during 2004 or through February 2005 under Valero’s $400 million stock repurchase program that was publicly announced on December 3, 2001. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2004, Valero contributed approximately $73 million to its qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.75% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2004, the fair value of the assets in Valero’s qualified pension plans were equal to approximately 73% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2004. However, the qualified pension plans were more than 90% funded based on their “current liability,” which is a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations. Although Valero has no minimum required contributions to its qualified pension plans during 2005 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Valero expects to contribute approximately $60 million to its qualified pension plans during 2005. Environmental Matters Valero is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of Valero’s refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. For additional information regarding Valero’s environmental matters, including a discussion of capital expenditures related to environmental regulations, see “Environmental Matters” in Items 1 & 2, “Business & Properties” and Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Accounts Receivable Sales Facility As of December 31, 2004, Valero had an accounts receivable sales facility with three third-party financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $600 million of eligible trade and credit card receivables, which matures in October 2005. Valero uses this program as a source of working capital funding. Under this program, a wholly owned subsidiary of Valero sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third-party financial institutions. Valero remains responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pays certain fees related to its sale of receivables under the program. As of December 31, 2004, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party financial institutions was $600 million. Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional discussion of the activity related to this program. Termination of this program would require Valero to obtain alternate working capital funding, which would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on Valero’s consolidated balance sheet. However, as of December 31, 2004, the termination of this program would not have had a material effect on Valero’s liquidity and would not have affected Valero’s ability to comply with restrictive covenants in its credit facilities. Valero is not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity. Valero’s board of directors has approved an extension of this program, which is subject to finalization of the terms of the agreements with the third-party financial institutions. Guarantees In connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business in May 2002, Valero guaranteed certain lease payment obligations related to a lease assumed by Tesoro, which totaled approximately $34 million as of December 31, 2004. This lease expires in 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2004, Valero was not required to, and did not, make any payments under this guarantee. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for Valero’s financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, or is not expected to have, a material effect on Valero’s consolidated financial statements, except as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under “FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004).” CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about Valero’s critical accounting policies, including separate identification of those involving critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes Valero’s significant accounting policies. 46 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on Valero’s consolidated financial position and results of operations. Valero believes that all of its estimates are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long-lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, estimated remaining life of the asset, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting Valero’s earnings. Valero’s impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are consistent with Valero’s business plans. However, providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. Valero recognized an impairment charge of $57.2 million in 2004 related to its equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. as discussed in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and an impairment charge of $25.8 million in 2003 related to Valero’s former headquarters buildings as discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Valero did not recognize an impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2002. Environmental Liabilities Valero’s operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as Valero’s own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of Valero’s obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes. 47 Table of Contents The balance of and changes in Valero’s accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Valero believes that it has adequately accrued for its environmental exposures. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Valero has significant pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside Valero’s control. For example, the discount rate assumption is based on Moody’s published Aa corporate bond rate as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for Valero by an outside consultant using historical market index data from 1926 through 2001 with an asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, representative of the asset mix in Valero’s qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in Valero’s consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2004 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2005 (in millions): Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Increase in benefit obligation: Discount rate decrease $ 42.8 $ 9.4 Compensation rate increase 16.2 — Health care cost trend rate increase — 3.4 Increase in expense: Discount rate decrease 6.3 0.8 Expected return on plan assets decrease 1.4 — Compensation rate increase 3.6 — Health care cost trend rate increase — 0.4 Other Critical Accounting Policies The following accounting policies are less sensitive to management estimates but are presented to enable a more complete understanding and comparability of Valero’s more significant accounting policies. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery feedstocks purchased for processing and refined products are determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory pricing. The cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of materials, supplies and convenience store merchandise are determined under the weighted-average cost method. Valero utilizes the dollar-value LIFO method and uses average purchase prices during the year to value any increments to its LIFO inventory. Property, Plant and Equipment Valero records depreciation expense on its property, plant and equipment primarily using the composite method of depreciation. Under the composite method of depreciation, the costs of minor property units, net of salvage value, retired or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated depreciation while gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of major units are recorded in income. Although accounting for property, plant 48 Table of Contents and equipment requires various judgments and estimates, including a determination of remaining useful lives, salvage values and the significance of dispositions in determining the accounting for gains and losses, changes in such estimates for any particular asset are not expected to significantly affect Valero’s results of operations or financial condition due to Valero’s use of the composite method of depreciation. Refinery Turnaround Costs Refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities at Valero’s refineries, are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs. The frequency of refinery turnarounds varies with each refinery operating unit. As of December 31, 2004, Valero had $320.4 million of deferred refinery turnaround costs included in its consolidated balance sheet. Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, Valero must assess the likelihood that its deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent Valero believes that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. Valero had a valuation allowance recorded as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred income tax assets, primarily consisting of certain state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards, before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on Valero’s estimates of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which it operates and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable. If actual results differ from the estimates or Valero adjusts the estimates in future periods, Valero may need to revise the valuation allowance. However, significant changes in such valuation allowances have not had in the past, and are not expected to have in the future, a material effect on Valero’s financial condition or results of operations. The net deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $526.7 million and $600.1 million, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $83.3 million and $82.6 million, respectively. Asset Retirement Obligations Effective January 1, 2003, Valero adopted Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which established accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost. An entity is required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, projected cash flows, a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation. These estimates and assumptions are very subjective. However, Valero believes it has adequately accrued for its asset retirement obligations and that changes in estimates in future periods would not have a significant effect on Valero’s financial condition or results of operations. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of the effect of Valero’s adoption of Statement No. 143. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK Valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of its unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). Valero also uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). In addition, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility on a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases that do not receive hedge accounting treatment. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. Finally, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes based on its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions. See “Derivative Instruments” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the accounting treatment for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in Valero’s hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures and options. Valero’s positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with Valero’s stated risk management policy which has been approved by Valero’s board of directors. The following tables provide information about Valero’s derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including: • fair value hedges held to hedge refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments, • cash flow hedges held to hedge forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases, • economic hedges held to: • manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, and • manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases, and • trading activities held or issued for trading purposes. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. The gain (loss) on swaps is equal to the fair value amount and represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price times the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the gain (loss) represents (i) the excess of the fair value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the fair value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options represents their strike price. 50 Table of Contents December 31, 2004 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Contract Pay Receive Contract Fair Gain Volumes Price Price Value Value (Loss) Fair Value Hedges: Futures – long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 17,423 $ 46.39 N/A $ 808.2 $ 772.4 $ (35.8 ) Futures – short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 26,726 N/A $ 46.00 1,229.3 1,190.0 39.3 Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps – long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 67,378 37.05 42.84 N/A 390.3 390.3 Swaps – short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 67,378 48.54 41.65 N/A (464.1 ) (464.1 ) Futures – long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 28,354 45.39 N/A 1,287.0 1,286.1 (0.9 ) Futures – short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 23,152 N/A 45.95 1,063.7 1,066.6 (2.9 ) Economic Hedges: Swaps – long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 3,505 11.49 11.37 N/A (0.4 ) (0.4 ) Swaps – short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 4,239 10.10 10.25 N/A 0.6 0.6 Futures – long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 19,230 46.90 N/A 901.9 896.2 (5.7 ) Futures – short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 17,787 N/A 47.55 845.8 823.8 22.0 Options – long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 1,000 35.00 N/A 2.8 4.7 1.9 Options – short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 4,201 N/A 21.69 (2.4 ) 2.4 (4.8 ) Trading Activities: Swaps – long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 25,460 35.15 39.17 N/A 102.4 102.4 Swaps – short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 23,585 42.66 38.20 N/A (105.3 ) (105.3 ) Futures – long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 15,956 45.09 N/A 719.5 725.4 5.9 2005 (natural gas) 210 7.04 N/A 1.5 1.3 (0.2 ) Futures – short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 21,781 N/A 45.81 997.7 1,002.8 (5.1 ) 2005 (natural gas) 210 N/A 6.38 1.4 1.3 0.1 Options – long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 1,550 48.35 N/A 1.3 1.6 0.3 Options – short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 150 N/A 10.55 (0.2 ) (0.4 ) 0.2 51 Table of Contents December 31, 2003 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Contract Pay Receive Contract Fair Gain Volumes Price Price Value Value (Loss) Fair Value Hedges: Futures – long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 26,464 $ 31.72 N/A $ 839.4 $ 860.1 $ 20.7 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 2 29.84 N/A — — — Futures – short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 36,110 N/A $ 31.59 1,140.7 1,180.5 (39.8 ) Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps – long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 61,020 27.89 30.38 N/A 152.0 152.0 2004 (natural gas) 915 5.66 6.08 N/A 0.4 0.4 Swaps – short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 61,520 34.01 31.62 N/A (147.3 ) (147.3 ) 2004 (natural gas) 458 6.08 5.61 N/A (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Futures – long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 17,266 32.05 N/A 553.5 567.2 13.7 Futures – short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 14,600 N/A 33.35 487.0 502.1 (15.1 ) 2004 (natural gas) 540 N/A 5.24 2.8 3.3 (0.5 ) Economic Hedges: Swaps – long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 2,658 10.73 10.97 N/A 0.6 0.6 Swaps – short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 7,428 1.66 2.02 N/A 2.6 2.6 Futures – long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 16,604 37.25 N/A 618.5 622.9 4.4 Futures – short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 19,788 N/A 36.32 718.7 730.1 (11.4 ) Options – long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 24,719 9.72 N/A 7.0 12.5 5.5 2004 (natural gas) 913 5.05 N/A 0.5 0.9 0.4 Options – short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 34,269 N/A 9.68 (13.7 ) (13.2 ) (0.5 ) Trading Activities: Swaps – long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 8,330 17.09 18.43 N/A 11.2 11.2 Swaps – short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 8,675 18.99 17.75 N/A (10.7 ) (10.7 ) Futures – long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 22,396 31.21 N/A 699.1 724.2 25.1 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 200 26.46 N/A 5.3 5.7 0.4 2004 (natural gas) 300 5.08 N/A 1.5 1.7 0.2 Futures – short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 21,416 N/A 31.79 680.8 703.6 (22.8 ) 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 200 N/A 31.71 6.3 6.7 (0.4 ) 2004 (natural gas) 300 N/A 5.75 1.7 1.8 (0.1 ) Options – long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 12,671 13.62 N/A 3.7 8.0 4.3 Options – short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 7,647 N/A 8.56 (3.0 ) (0.7 ) (2.3 ) 52 Table of Contents INTEREST RATE RISK Valero’s primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to its long-term debt obligations. Valero manages its exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, Valero utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged, and the recorded amount of the derivative instrument and long-term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. The following table provides information about Valero’s long-term debt and interest rate derivative instruments (dollars in millions), all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted-average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted-average floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.

These interest rate swap contracts currently have an estimated pay rate of 3.6% and hedge $200 million of debt with a fixed interest rate of 4.75%. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Valero enters into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to its Canadian operations. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. During May 2002, Valero entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an investment in its Canadian operations that Valero intended to redeem in the future. Under these contracts, Valero sold $400 million of Canadian dollars and bought $253.4 million of U.S. dollars. In February 2004, Valero redeemed its remaining balance of this investment in its Canadian operations. As a result, Valero liquidated the outstanding amount of these foreign currency exchange contracts for a net cash payment by Valero of approximately $34 million, with an immaterial effect on income in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the liquidation of these contracts. As of December 31, 2004, Valero had other commitments to purchase $5.0 million of U.S. dollars. Valero’s market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before January 6, 2005. As of December 31, 2004, Valero had also entered into a foreign currency exchange contract relating to the purchase of commercial paper, which requires Valero to sell $20.0 million of U.S. dollars in May 2005. The effect on this contract of a hypothetical 10% change in the year-end exchange rate would be approximately $2 million. 54 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:44:32.546200

We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 22 Table of Contents OVERVIEW As of December 31, 2005, we owned and operated 18 refineries in the United States, Canada and Aruba with a combined throughput capacity, including crude oil and other feedstocks, of approximately 3.3 million barrels per day. We market refined products through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network and a network of approximately 5,000 retail and wholesale branded outlets in the United States, Canada and Aruba under various brand names including primarily Valeroâ, Diamond Shamrockâ, Shamrockâ, Ultramarâ and Beaconâ. During the second quarter of 2005, we announced our plan to retire the Diamond Shamrock brand and convert those U.S. retail and wholesale sites to the Valero brand. This program is progressing well, with 385 sites having been converted to the Valero brand by the end of 2005 and 894 sites remaining to be rebranded during 2006 and early 2007. Our operations are affected by: • company-specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance turnarounds; • seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products; and • industry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices including the effect of quality differential between grades of crude oil, the demand for and prices of refined products, industry supply capacity and competitor refinery maintenance turnarounds. Our profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the “refined product margin.” Since almost 70% of our total crude oil throughput represents sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that are purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil, our profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the “sour crude oil discount.” During 2005, we benefited from even stronger industry fundamentals than the already strong industry fundamentals experienced in 2004. In reporting our results for 2004, we indicated that both refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts were the best we had ever experienced. During 2005, gasoline and distillate margins improved in all four of our refining regions, with overall distillate margins more than double the 2004 margins. In addition, the sour crude oil discount increased more than 30%. This improvement in gasoline and distillate margins combined with the strong sour crude oil discounts contributed to a significant increase in operating results in 2005 compared to the prior year, resulting in earnings per share of $6.10 for 2005, or an 87% increase over the $3.27 earnings per share reported for 2004. On September 1, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Premcor. Premcor owned and operated refineries in Port Arthur, Texas, Lima, Ohio, Memphis, Tennessee, and Delaware City, Delaware, with a combined crude oil throughput capacity of approximately 800,000 barrels per day. We benefited from the addition of the four former Premcor refineries, which generated approximately $810 million of operating income during the last four months of 2005. The positive industry fundamentals experienced during the year ended December 31, 2005, combined with the incremental operating income generated from the Premcor Acquisition, resulted in net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 that was approximately double the net income reported for the year ended December 31, 2004. We reported net income of $3.6 billion for 2005, compared to $1.8 billion for 2004. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio (net of cash) decreased approximately 6% during 2005 to 24.8%. 23 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2005 Compared to 2004 Financial Highlights (millions of

(a) Includes the operations related to the Premcor Acquisition commencing on September 1, 2005. A $621 million LIFO charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded under our LIFO accounting policy was excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented herein in order to make the information presented comparable between periods. (b) Includes the operations related to the Aruba Acquisition commencing on March 5, 2004. (c) Operating revenues and cost of sales both include approximately $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 and approximately $4.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 related to certain crude oil buy/sell arrangements, which involve linked purchases and sales related to crude oil contracts entered into to address location, quality or grade requirements. For further explanation of this accounting treatment, see the discussion about EITF No. 04-13 in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (e) Total throughput volumes and throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast region for the year ended December 31, 2004 are based on 366 days, which results in 183,000 barrels per day being included for the Aruba Refinery for the year ended December 31, 2004. Throughput volumes for the Aruba Refinery for the 302 days of its operations during 2004 averaged 221,000 barrels per day. (f) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke and asphalt. (g) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries subsequent to the Premcor Acquisition: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, Memphis and Lima Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec, Paulsboro and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (h) Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and Northeast regions for the year ended December 31, 2005 include 78,000, 106,000 and 63,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor commencing on September 1, 2005. Throughput volumes for those acquired refineries for the 122 days of their operations subsequent to the acquisition date of September 1, 2005 were 234,000, 317,000, and 187,000 barrels per day, respectively, for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and Northeast regions. (i) The information presented for the Mid-Continent region includes the operations of the Denver Refinery through May 31, 2005, the date of our sale of this facility to Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc.

Throughput volumes for the Mid-Continent region 27 Table of Contents include 15,000 and 37,000 barrels per day related to the Denver Refinery for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (j) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platt’s Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services-London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (k) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues increased 50% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of significantly higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations. Operating income and net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating income increased $2.5 billion, or 83%, from 2004 to 2005 due primarily to a $2.6 billion increase in the refining segment, partially offset by a $34 million decrease in the retail segment and a $107 million increase in general and administrative expenses (including corporate depreciation and amortization expense). Refining Operating income for our refining segment increased from $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, resulting mainly from an increase in refining throughput margin of $3.70 per barrel, or 50%, and a 15% increase in throughput volumes, partially offset by an increase in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense) of $989 million. Refining total throughput margin for 2005 increased primarily due to the following factors: • Distillate margins increased significantly in all of our refining regions during 2005 compared to 2004, with margins in the Gulf Coast region almost triple the margins in 2004 and margins in the Mid-Continent and Northeast regions more than double 2004 margins. The improvement in distillate margins was due to increased foreign and U.S. demand, resulting from improved U.S. and global economies and higher demand for on-road diesel and jet fuel. In addition, both gasoline and distillate margins increased significantly in September and October of 2005 due to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which reduced the supply of refined products as refineries along the Gulf Coast reduced or shut down their operations because of the hurricanes. • Discounts on our sour crude oil feedstocks improved during 2005 compared to 2004 due to ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. In addition, discounts on sour crude oil feedstocks benefited from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from several factors, including (i) the global movement to cleaner fuels, which has required most refineries to lower the sulfur content of the gasoline they produce, and (ii) a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which has resulted in higher utilization rates by refineries that require sweet crude oil as feedstock. • Throughput volumes increased 326,000 barrels per day in 2005 compared to 2004 due mainly to throughput of 247,000 barrels per day at the four refineries acquired from Premcor on September 1, 2005, incremental throughput of 40,000 barrels per day at the Aruba Refinery, which was acquired in March 2004, and lower volumes in 2004 due to turnarounds at the St. Charles, Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. The above increases in throughput margin for 2005 were partially offset by the effects of: • lower margins on other refined products such as petroleum coke, sulfur, No. 6 fuel oil, asphalt and propylene due to a significant increase in the price of crude oil from 2004 to 2005, and 28 Table of Contents • increased pre-tax losses of approximately $295 million on hedges related to forward sales of distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 37% higher for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 due mainly to $420 million of expenses related to the refineries acquired in the Premcor Acquisition, a full year of operations of the Aruba Refinery, and increases in energy costs, employee compensation expense and maintenance expense. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 39% from 2004 to 2005 due mainly to depreciation expense resulting from the Premcor Acquisition on September 1, 2005, implementation of new capital projects, increased turnaround and catalyst amortization, a $15 million gain in 2004 on the sale of certain property discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the write-off of costs in 2005 resulting from the decision to convert wholesale sites marketing under the Diamond Shamrock brand to the Valero brand. Retail Retail operating income was $141 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $175 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of 19% between the periods. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased selling expenses in the U.S. and Northeast as higher retail fuel prices resulted in higher credit card processing fees. In addition, Northeast selling expenses increased $15 million due to an increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $107 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits. These increases were mainly related to the recognition of increased variable compensation expense, resulting in large part from a significant increase in our common stock price during 2005, and expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel. These increases were partially offset by the successful resolution in the first quarter of 2005 of a California excise tax dispute. “Other income (expense), net” improved $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to the combined effect of a $55 million gain realized on the sale of our equity interests in Javelina Company and Javelina Pipeline Company in November 2005 and a 2004 impairment charge of $57 million to write off the carrying amount of our equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. This combined effect, as well as an increase in bank interest income due to higher cash balances, was partially offset by our 50% interest in certain debt refinancing costs incurred in 2005 by the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline joint venture and increased costs related to our accounts receivable sales program. Interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2004 to 2005 due to interest incurred in 2005 on the debt resulting from the Premcor Acquisition. However, the increased interest incurred was almost entirely offset by increased capitalized interest due to an increase in capital projects, including those at the four former Premcor refineries. Income tax expense increased $791 million from 2004 to 2005 mainly as a result of a 95% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005, however, decreased from the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of a change in permanent book-to-tax differences, 29 Table of Contents which included a deduction from income in 2005 for qualified domestic manufacturing activities, as allowed under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 2004 Compared to 2003 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2004 (a) 2003 (b) Change Operating revenues (c) $ 54,619 $ 37,969 $ 16,650 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales (c) 47,797 33,587 14,210 Refining operating expenses 2,141 1,656 485 Retail selling expenses 705 694 11 General and administrative expenses 379 299 80 Depreciation and amortization expense: Refining 518 417 101 Retail 58 40 18 Corporate 42 54 (12 ) Total costs and expenses 51,640 36,747 14,893 Operating income 2,979 1,222 1,757 Equity in earnings of Valero L.P.

For further explanation of this accounting treatment, see the discussion about EITF No. 04-13 in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) On March 18, 2003, our ownership interest in Valero L.P. decreased from 73.6% to 49.5%. As a result of this decrease in ownership of Valero L.P. combined with certain other partnership governance changes, we ceased consolidating Valero L.P. as of that date and began using the equity method to account for our investment in the partnership. (e) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (f) Total throughput volumes and throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast region for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are based on 366 days and 365 days, respectively, which results in 183,000 barrels per day and 99,000 barrels per day being included for the Aruba Refinery in 2004 and the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, respectively. Throughput volumes for the Aruba Refinery for the 302 days of its operations during 2004 averaged 221,000 barrels per day. Throughput volumes for the St. Charles Refinery for the 184 days of its operations during 2003 averaged 197,000 barrels per day. (g) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke and asphalt. (h) The Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles and Aruba Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore and Denver Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec and Paulsboro Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (i) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platt’s Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services-London Oil Reports. The CARBOB 87 gasoline differential for 2003 represents CARB 87 gasoline, which includes MTBE as a blending component, for the periods prior to October 31, 2003. Prices for products meeting these specifications ceased to be available after October 31, 2003. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented 33 Table of Contents to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (j) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues increased 44% from the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations. The increases in operating income from $1.2 billion for 2003 to $3.0 billion for 2004 and net income from $622 million for 2003 to $1.8 billion for 2004 were attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for our refining segment as discussed below. Refining Operating income for our refining segment was $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $1.9 billion from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in refining segment operating income resulted primarily from a 45% increase in refining throughput margin per barrel and an 18% increase in refining throughput volumes, partially offset by a $586 million increase in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense). Refining total throughput margin for 2004 increased due to the following factors: • Discounts on our sour crude oil feedstocks improved during 2004 compared to 2003 due to ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. In addition, discounts on sour crude oil feedstocks benefited from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from several factors, including (i) the global movement to cleaner fuels, which has required refineries to lower the sulfur content of the gasoline they produce, (ii) high gasoline margins, which increased the demand for sweet versus sour crude oil due to the higher gasoline content of sweet crude oil, and (iii) a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which has resulted in more gasoline production by less complex foreign refineries that require sweet crude oil as feedstock. • Gasoline margins increased in all of our refining regions during 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to strong demand. Gasoline demand was up in 2004 primarily due to strong U.S. and global economic activity. • Distillate margins also increased in all of our refining regions in 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to increased foreign and U.S. demand resulting from improved economies. • Petrochemical feedstock margins improved significantly in 2004 compared to 2003 due to increased demand for such feedstocks resulting from a stronger worldwide economy. • Our throughput volumes increased 327,000 barrels per day in 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to incremental throughput of 117,000 barrels per day at the St. Charles Refinery, which was acquired in July 2003, and 183,000 barrels per day of throughput at the Aruba Refinery during the partial period commencing on its acquisition date of March 5, 2004. The above increases in throughput margin for 2004 were partially offset by the effects of: • lower margins on products such as asphalt, No. 6 fuel oil, sulfur and petroleum coke due to an increase in the price of crude oil in 2004 compared to 2003, • an approximate $20 million reduction resulting from our ceasing consolidation of Valero L.P. commencing in March 2003, • a higher level of turnaround activity in 2004 compared to 2003, and • approximately $230 million of pre-tax losses in 2004 on hedges related to forward sales of distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil. 34 Table of Contents Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 29% higher for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 due primarily to the acquisitions of the St. Charles Refinery in July 2003 and the Aruba Refinery in March 2004, higher energy costs (primarily related to an increase in natural gas prices), increased maintenance expense, an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense including increased variable and incentive compensation, and increases in insurance expense, injected catalyst, professional fees and regulatory costs. Although total refining operating expenses increased 29% from 2003 to 2004, this increase was 9% on a per-barrel basis. The lower percentage increase on a per-barrel basis was due to the throughput increases that resulted from the St. Charles and Aruba Acquisitions. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24% from the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2004 due mainly to the implementation of new capital projects, the acquisitions of the St. Charles and Aruba Refineries and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $175 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $37 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. Retail fuel margins in the United States decreased due to a rise in crude oil prices during 2004 which could not be fully passed through to the consumer, and fuel sales declined in the United States due to fewer stores. Retail depreciation and amortization expense was higher in 2004 due mainly to gains recognized in 2003 on the disposition of certain home heating oil businesses and service stations. In the Northeast, operating income declined due mainly to an increase in selling expenses resulting primarily from a significant increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate from 2003 to 2004. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Employee compensation and benefits increased approximately $41 million from 2003 to 2004, including the recognition of increased variable and incentive compensation expense of approximately $21 million as a result of improved financial performance between the respective years. The remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to costs related to legal and regulatory matters and increased charitable contributions. Equity in earnings of Valero L.P. represents our equity interest in the earnings of Valero L.P. after March 18, 2003. On March 18, 2003, our ownership interest in Valero L.P. decreased from 73.6% to 49.5%. As a result of this decrease in ownership of Valero L.P. combined with certain other partnership governance changes, we ceased consolidating Valero L.P. as of that date and began using the equity method to account for our investment in Valero L.P. The minority interest in net income of Valero L.P. represented the minority unitholders’ share of the net income of Valero L.P. during the periods that we consolidated such operations. “Other income (expense), net” for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes an impairment charge of $57 million to write off the carrying amount of our equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P., as further described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the effect of this impairment charge, other income declined $6 million due primarily to the nonrecurrence of a $17 million gain recognized in 2003 related to the sale of certain notes received as partial consideration for the 2002 sale of the Golden Eagle Business (described further in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by a $10 million increase in equity income in 2004 from the Javelina joint venture due to higher natural gas liquids prices. 35 Table of Contents Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts ceased during 2003 due to the redemption of the 8.32% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (TOPrS) in June 2003 and the settlement of the Premium Equity Participating Security Units (PEPS Units) in August 2003. Income tax expense increased $541 million from 2003 to 2004 mainly as a result of a 175% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004, however, decreased from the year ended December 31, 2003 due mainly to income contributed by the Aruba Refinery in 2004, the operations of which are non-taxable in Aruba through December 31, 2010. OUTLOOK In January 2006, we saw a continuation of the positive refining industry fundamentals that we experienced in 2005. Refined product margins for January 2006 were well above historical five-year averages. For example, the Gulf Coast gasoline margin for January 2006 was $6.66 per barrel compared to the historical January average for the last five years of $5.18 per barrel, while the Gulf Coast distillate margin was $7.84 per barrel, $3.23 per barrel above the historical January average for the last five years of $4.61 per barrel. Despite a drop in refined product margins in February due primarily to an unusually warm winter and record imports of winter-grade gasolines, we expect these strong fundamentals to remain in place throughout 2006. Our outlook for gasoline margins is positive as we expect demand for gasoline during 2006 to remain strong due to continuing strong economic activity in the United States and abroad. We expect that the supply required to satisfy the high demand will be tight for several reasons. First, gasoline inventories in early 2006 on a days-of-supply basis have been low for this time of year. Second, a very high level of turnaround activity is projected for the first half of 2006 for the U.S. refining industry, which should reduce gasoline production. Third, the industry’s typical switch to summer-grade gasoline in early March will be complicated this year by the lower sulfur-content specifications that have taken effect. Fourth, the effective elimination by Congress of MTBE in the gasoline pool by early in the second quarter of 2006 is expected to result in a loss of gasoline production that will have to be made up through increased imports or the blending of higher-cost blendstocks, either of which will require higher margins to attract the necessary supply. And finally, a limited amount of new refining capacity in the U.S. is expected to come on-line in 2006. The outlook for low-sulfur distillate margins is also favorable. Inventories of on-road diesel on a days-of-supply basis are near historical five-year lows. We expect that supplies of on-road diesel will remain tight throughout 2006 as demand is expected to exceed production capacity, particularly in light of the EPA’s tightening diesel fuel specifications that take effect on June 1, 2006. Sour crude oil discounts are also expected to remain wide for the foreseeable future. The combination of high refined product margins and the new low-sulfur specifications for refined products has resulted in increased demand for sweet crude oil versus sour crude oil due to its higher yield of light products and lower sulfur content. Higher utilization rates globally by certain less complex refineries have also resulted in the production of more residual fuel oil. The increased supply of resid supports wider discounts for heavy sour crude oil since complex refiners can substitute resid for a portion of their heavy sour crude oil purchases if resid becomes more economic to process than crude oil. Overall, we believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the expected continuing positive industry fundamentals and our resulting favorable outlook for refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts during 2006. 36 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $5.8 billion compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $2.8 billion. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the significant increase in operating income discussed above under “Results of Operations” and an $879 million increase from favorable working capital changes between the years, as reflected in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2005, working capital was positively impacted by a $400 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program and a decrease in restricted cash of approximately $200 million due to the repayment of certain debt assumed in the Premcor Acquisition using funds restricted for that purpose. Both receivables and accounts payable increased significantly due to commodity price increases from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. The net cash generated from operating activities during 2005, combined with $1.5 billion of proceeds from debt borrowings, $428 million of available cash on hand, $227 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our benefit plans, $78 million of proceeds from the sale of our investment in the Javelina joint venture and $45 million of proceeds from the sale of the Denver Refinery, and a $38 million net return of investment from the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline joint venture resulting mainly from the refinancing of the joint venture’s debt in June 2005, were used mainly to: • fund $2.6 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • make debt repayments of $2.4 billion; • fund $2.3 billion of the Premcor Acquisition, net of cash acquired; • purchase 13 million shares of treasury stock at a cost of $571 million; • fund contingent payments of $85 million in connection with prior acquisitions; • fund certain minor acquisitions for $62 million; • make a general partner contribution to Valero L.P. of $29 million; and • pay common and preferred stock dividends of $106 million. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $3.0 billion compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $1.2 billion. The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to the significant increase in operating income in 2004 as described above under “Results of Operations,” partially offset by a $226 million decrease in the amount of favorable working capital changes between the years. As reflected in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the year ended December 31, 2004, working capital requirements decreased by $203 million compared to a $429 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease for 2004 was largely due to a significant increase in current income tax liabilities, while 2003 benefited primarily from a $350 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program. In addition to the $3.0 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, we generated cash from various other sources during 2004, including proceeds of $406 million from the sale of common stock, $135 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our benefit plans, $108 million of proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment, and $64 million of net borrowings (borrowings net of debt repayments). We used these proceeds to: • fund $1.6 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • exercise options under structured lease arrangements to purchase $567 million of leased property; • fund the Aruba Acquisition for $541 million, net of cash acquired; 37 Table of Contents • purchase 19 million shares of treasury stock at a cost of $318 million; • fund contingent payments in connection with prior acquisitions of $53 million; • invest $36 million in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project (described further in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); • pay common and preferred stock dividends of $79 million; and • increase our cash balance by $495 million. Capital Investments On September 1, 2005, we completed our merger with Premcor. We paid the $3.4 billion cash portion of the merger consideration from available cash and proceeds from a $1.5 billion five-year bank term loan due in August 2010 (see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the $1.5 billion term loan). In addition, we assumed Premcor’s existing debt, which had a fair value of $1.9 billion as of September 1, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we incurred $2.1 billion for capital expenditures and $441 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2005 included approximately $1.1 billion of costs related to environmental projects. In addition, $85 million of contingent earn-out payments were made, $62 million was expended for minor acquisitions, $29 million was contributed to Valero L.P. in conjunction with its acquisition of Kaneb Pipe Line Partners, L.P. (Kaneb Partners) and Kaneb Services LLC (together, the Kaneb Acquisition) to maintain our 2% general partner interest in Valero L.P., and $20 million was expended on the conversion of U.S. retail and wholesale sites from the Diamond Shamrock brand to the Valero brand (with approximately $45 million of additional spending anticipated during 2006 and early 2007 on this program). In connection with our acquisitions of Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997 and the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the sellers are entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years and seven years, respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified level (see the discussion in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In connection with the Premcor Acquisition, we assumed Premcor’s obligation under an earn-out contingency agreement related to Premcor’s acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery from Motiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva). Under this agreement, Motiva is entitled to receive two separate annual earn-out contingency payments depending on (a) the amount of crude oil processed at the refinery and the level of refining margins through May 2007, and (b) the achievement of certain performance criteria at the gasification facility through May 2006. Any payments due under all of these earn-out arrangements are limited based on annual and aggregate limits. During 2005, we made earn-out payments of $50 million related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and $35 million related to the Basis Petroleum Acquisition. In January 2006, we made an earn-out payment of $50 million related to the St. Charles Acquisition. Based on estimated margin levels through April 2006, earn-out payments of $26 million (maximum remaining payment based on the aggregate limitation under the agreement) related to the Basis Petroleum Acquisition and $25 million related to the acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery would be due in the second quarter of 2006. For 2006, we expect to incur approximately $3.4 billion for capital investments, including approximately $3.0 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $1.3 billion of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $400 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to the contingent earn-out agreements discussed above and strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Long-term debt $ 220 $ 287 $ 6 $ 209 $ 208 $ 4,392 $ 5,322 Capital lease obligations 6 7 6 7 6 39 71 Operating lease obligations 320 285 226 160 96 443 1,530 Purchase obligations 17,304 6,258 5,735 1,489 303 2,555 33,644 Total $ 17,850 $ 6,837 $ 5,973 $ 1,865 $ 613 $ 7,429 $ 40,567 Long-Term Debt Payments for long-term debt are at stated values. In conjunction with the Premcor Acquisition, we assumed debt with a fair value of $1.9 billion and $14 million of capital lease obligations. In August 2005, we entered into a $1.5 billion term bank loan to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the Premcor Acquisition, which was fully repaid by December 31, 2005. During January 2005, we repurchased $40 million of our 7.375% notes due in March 2006 and $42 million of our 6.125% notes due in April 2007 at a premium of $4 million. In addition, during 2005, we made scheduled debt repayments of $410 million related to various notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During September 2005, we repurchased $190 million of the 7.75% senior subordinated notes assumed in the Premcor Acquisition. We also repurchased the 12.5% senior notes assumed in the Premcor Acquisition for $182 million in October 2005 and the Ohio Water Development Authority Environmental Facilities Revenue Bonds for $10 million in November 2005. As of December 31, 2005, “current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations” included mainly $220 million of notes which become due in the first quarter of 2006. Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. Following the completion of the Premcor Acquisition, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services affirmed its rating of our senior unsecured debt of BBB minus and recently changed our outlook from negative to stable while Moody’s Investors Service affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of Baa3 with a stable outlook. In February 2006, Fitch Ratings upgraded its rating of our senior unsecured debt to BBB with a stable outlook. Operating Lease Obligations Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply 39 Table of Contents arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities, feedstock and storage to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short-term and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2005, our short-term and long-term purchase obligations increased by approximately $19.1 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2004. The increase is primarily attributable to purchase obligations arising from the Premcor Acquisition totaling approximately $13.0 billion and an increase in obligations under crude oil supply contracts resulting from significantly higher crude oil prices as of December 31, 2005 and new contracts in 2005. We have not made in the past, nor do we expect to make in the future, payments for feedstock or services that we have not received or will not receive, nor paid prices in excess of then prevailing market conditions. Other Long-term Liabilities Our “other long-term liabilities” are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For most of these liabilities, the timing of the payment of such liabilities is not fixed and therefore cannot be determined as of December 31, 2005. However, certain expected payments related to our anticipated pension contribution in 2006 and our other postretirement benefit obligations are discussed in Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2005, our committed lines of credit were as follows: Borrowing Capacity Expiration 5-year revolving credit facility $2.5 billion August 2010 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn. $115 million December 2010 As of December 31, 2005, we had $232 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities, Cdn. $8 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Canadian committed revolving credit facility and $254 million of letters of credit outstanding under our 5-year committed revolving credit facility. All of these letters of credit expire during 2006. Under our revolving bank credit facility’s definitions, our debt-to-capitalization ratio (net of cash) was 24.8% as of December 31, 2005 compared to 30.7% as of December 31, 2004. Equity On September 1, 2005, we issued 85 million shares of common stock as partial consideration for the Premcor Acquisition. The common stock issued was recorded at a price of $37.41 per share, representing the average price of our common stock from two days before to two days after the announcement of the Premcor Acquisition in April 2005, resulting in an aggregate recorded amount of $3.2 billion for the common stock issued. In addition, we issued stock options with a fair value of $595 million. We purchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions to meet our obligations under employee benefit plans. We also purchase shares of our common stock from our employees and non-employee directors in connection with the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock and other stock compensation transactions. During 2005, we expended $571 million for the purchase of 13 million shares of our common stock under these programs. Through February 24, 2006, we have purchased in the open market an additional 40 Table of Contents 3.7 million common shares at a cost of $199 million. No shares were purchased during 2005 or through February 24, 2006 under our $400 million stock repurchase program that was publicly announced on December 3, 2001. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2005, we contributed $61 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.5% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2005, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans were equal to approximately 76% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2005. However, the qualified pension plans were more than 90% funded based on their “current liability,” which is a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations. Although our expected minimum required contribution to our qualified pension plans during 2006 is less than $5 million under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, we expect to contribute approximately $65 million to our qualified pension plans during 2006, including the former Premcor qualified pension plans discussed below. During January 2006, we contributed $15 million to our qualified pension plans. In connection with the Premcor Acquisition, we became the plan sponsor for two additional qualified pension plans. Prior to September 1, 2005, Premcor had contributed $20 million to these plans during 2005; we made no further contributions to these plans in 2005. Environmental Matters We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. For additional information regarding our environmental matters, see Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other During the third quarter of 2005, certain of our refineries experienced business interruption losses associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As a result of these losses, we have submitted claims to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies. No amounts related to these potential business interruption insurance recoveries were accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005. Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from the public and private capital markets and bank markets, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings. Under an existing shelf registration statement that was declared effective by the SEC in August 2004, we have $3.5 billion of securities registered for potential future issuance. However, there can be no assurances 41 Table of Contents regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. As of June 30, 2005, we owned 45.5% of the outstanding units (including the 2% general partner interest) of Valero L.P., a limited partnership that owns and operates crude oil and refined product pipeline, terminalling and storage tank assets. On July 1, 2005, our ownership interest decreased to 23.4% as a result of the completion of the Kaneb Acquisition by Valero L.P. Historically, Valero L.P. has issued common units to the public which have resulted in increases in our proportionate share of Valero L.P.’s capital because the issuance price per unit exceeded our carrying amount per unit at the time of issuance. These increases in our investment in Valero L.P., however, have not been recognized in our consolidated financial statements through December 31, 2005 and we are not permitted to do so until Valero L.P.’s subordinated units that we own convert to common units, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2006. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the amounts that will be recognized, either in income or directly as a credit to equity, upon the conversion of the subordinated units to common units. Subsequent to the conversion of the subordinated units, any credits or charges generated upon the issuance of new units to the public by Valero L.P. will be recognized immediately by us, either in income or directly in equity, depending on the accounting policy we adopt. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Accounts Receivable Sales Facility As of December 31, 2005, we had an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables, which matures in August 2008. We use this program as a source of working capital funding. Under this program, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third-party financial institutions. We remain responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pay certain fees related to our sale of receivables under the program. As of December 31, 2005, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party financial institutions was $1 billion. Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional discussion of the activity related to this program. Termination of this program would require us to obtain alternate working capital funding, which would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on our consolidated balance sheet. However, as of December 31, 2005, the termination of this program would not have had a material effect on our liquidity and would not have affected our ability to comply with restrictive covenants in our credit facilities. We are not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, or is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 42 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long-lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method investments and deferred tax assets) are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, estimated remaining life of the asset, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans. However, providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. We recognized an impairment charge of $57 million in 2004 related to our equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. as discussed in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and an impairment charge of $26 million in 2003 related to our former headquarters buildings as discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own 43 Table of Contents internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes. The balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that we have adequately accrued for our environmental exposures. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations We have significant pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption is based on a review of long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2005 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2006 (in millions): Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Increase in benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease $ 54 $ 16 Compensation rate increase 21 — Health care cost trend rate increase — 9 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease 9 1 Expected return on plan assets decrease 1 — Compensation rate increase 5 — Health care cost trend rate increase — 1 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). The carrying amount of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories was $3.8 billion and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and the fair value of such inventories was $7.1 billion and $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We also from time to time use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). We use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. Finally, we use derivative commodity instruments that we mark to market for trading purposes based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions. See “Derivative Instruments” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures and options. Our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy which has been approved by our board of directors. The following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including: • fair value hedges held to hedge refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments, • cash flow hedges held to hedge forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases, • economic hedges held to: • manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, and • manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases, and • trading activities held or issued for trading purposes. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. For futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period-end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. The fair value for futures, swaps and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. The fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. 45 Table of Contents Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options represents their strike price.

We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, we utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged, and the recorded amount of the derivative instrument and long-term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. The following table provides information about our long-term debt and interest rate derivative instruments (dollars in millions), all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted-average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted-average floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.

Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. During May 2002, we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an investment in our Canadian operations that we intended to redeem in the future. Under these contracts, we sold $400 million of Canadian dollars and bought $253 million of U.S. dollars. In February 2004, we redeemed our remaining balance of this investment in our Canadian operations. As a result, we liquidated the outstanding amount of these foreign currency exchange contracts for a net cash payment by us of approximately $34 million, with an immaterial effect on income in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the liquidation of these contracts. As of December 31, 2005, we had commitments to purchase $303 million of U.S. dollars. Our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before January 27, 2006. 49 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:44:37.496018

Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 22 Table of Contents OVERVIEW In this overview, we discuss the major transactions of our business during the year ended December 31, 2007 and describe some of the primary factors that we believe affected our results of operations during the year. Although we reported strong earnings from continuing operations for 2007, they decreased from comparable earnings reported in 2006. We reported income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion, or $7.72 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $5.3 billion, or $8.36 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the “refined product margin.” Gasoline and distillate margins in 2007 improved compared to such margins in 2006 primarily due to supply limitations caused by industry-wide refinery downtime, both planned and unplanned, lower imports into the United States, and tighter product specifications. However, rapidly rising crude oil prices resulted in lower margins for certain of our secondary products, such as asphalt, fuel oils, petroleum coke, and sulfur, the prices of which did not increase nearly as much as the cost of the feedstocks used to produce them. In addition, our contribution to earnings resulting from processing sour crude oil rather than sweet crude oil at many of our refineries decreased compared to 2006. Since more than 60% of our total crude oil throughput represents sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that are purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil, our profitability is significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the “sour crude oil differential.” Sour crude oil differentials relative to WTI crude oil for 2007, although good, decreased compared to the strong differentials in 2006. The fourth quarter of 2007 demonstrated the advantages of our complex and geographically diverse refining system. While refined product margins were reduced due to a significant increase in feedstock costs relative to product prices, our complex refineries were able to mitigate this unfavorable effect by benefiting from wide sour crude oil differentials. In addition, while product margins in the West Coast region were low, we were able to compensate somewhat for the effect of the low West Coast margins with earnings in the other geographic regions in which we operate. On February 16, 2007, our McKee Refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit, which reduced operating income by approximately $325 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The refinery recommenced operations in April at a reduced throughput rate, with run rates increasing to near full capacity by the end of the third quarter of 2007. All repairs have now been completed and the refinery is running at normal capacity as of February 2008. Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our refinery in Lima, Ohio to Husky Refining Company (Husky), a wholly owned subsidiary of Husky Energy Inc. The sales price was approximately $2.4 billion, including approximately $550 million from the sale of working capital to Husky, primarily related to the sale of inventory by our marketing and supply subsidiary. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $827 million. During 2007, we also recognized a pre-tax gain of $91 million related to a foreign currency exchange rate gain resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary. In the second quarter of 2007, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program under which we purchased 42.1 million shares of our common stock, which was subsequently funded mainly with proceeds from our issuance of $2.25 billion of new debt during 2007. During 2007, we continued our ongoing effort to increase shareholder value by using a balanced approach to allocating our cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we generated $5.3 billion of net cash from operating activities, using portions of that cash to increase our 2007 common stock dividends from $0.08 per share to $0.12 per share and to purchase 42.2 million shares of our common stock in addition to the 42.1 million shares purchased under the accelerated share repurchase program discussed above. During 2007, we repurchased 14% of our shares that were outstanding at the beginning of 2007. We also invested $2.8 billion of capital into our refining system and other assets. 23 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2007 Compared to 2006 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2007 (a) 2006 (a) Change Operating revenues (b) $ 95,327 $ 87,640 $ 7,687 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales (b) 81,645 73,863 7,782 Refining operating expenses 4,016 3,622 394 Retail selling expenses (b) 750 719 31 General and administrative expenses 638 598 40 Depreciation and amortization expense: Refining 1,222 985 237 Retail 90 87 3 Corporate 48 44 4 Total costs and expenses 88,409 79,918 8,491 Operating income 6,918 7,722 (804 ) Equity in earnings of NuStar Energy L.P (c) -

(a) Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky. Therefore, the results of operations of the Lima Refinery are reported as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid-Continent region, exclude the Lima Refinery. (b) Certain amounts previously reported in 2006 for operating revenues, cost of sales, retail selling expenses, and margin on miscellaneous sales have been reclassified for comparability with amounts reported in 2007. (c) On December 22, 2006, we sold our remaining ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC (formerly Valero GP Holdings, LLC), which indirectly owned the general partner interest, the incentive distribution rights, and a 21.4% limited partner interest in NuStar Energy L.P. (formerly Valero L.P.) As a result, the financial highlights reflect no equity in earnings of NuStar Energy L.P. or minority interest in net income of NuStar GP Holdings, LLC subsequent to December 21, 2006. (d) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes.

Operating income decreased $804 million, or 10%, and income from continuing operations decreased $722 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to an $827 million decrease in refining segment operating income. The refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations exclude the operations of the Lima Refinery which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $8.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 resulting mainly from increased refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense) of $631 million. In addition, total throughput margin for the refining segment declined by $196 million due to a $0.14 per barrel decrease in refining throughput margin and lower throughput volumes. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased $0.40 per barrel, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating expenses increased mainly due to increases in maintenance expense, employee compensation and related benefits, outside services, and energy costs, as well as increased accruals for sales and use taxes. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24% from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects, increased turnaround and catalyst amortization, and the write-off of costs related to the McKee Refinery as a result of a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit in February 2007. Total refining throughput margins for 2007 compared to 2006 were impacted by the following factors: • Overall, gasoline and distillate margins relative to WTI increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a decline in refined product inventory levels resulting from unplanned refinery outages, lower imports, more stringent product specifications and regulations, and heavy industry turnaround activity, as well as moderately stronger demand. • Sour crude oil feedstock differentials to WTI crude oil during 2007 decreased from the strong differentials in 2006. However, other light, sweet crude oils priced at a premium to WTI in 2007; thus, sour crude oil feedstock differentials relative to those other light, sweet crude oils in 2007 were comparable to the wide differentials experienced in 2006. These wide differentials are attributable to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for gasoline and diesel and a global increase in refined product demand. • Margins on various secondary refined products such as asphalt, fuel oils, petroleum coke, and sulfur were lower in 2007 as prices for these products did not increase in proportion to the costs of the feedstocks used to produce them. • Throughput volumes decreased 13,000 barrels per day during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a reduction in throughput volumes at our McKee Refinery as a result of the fire discussed above. Retail Retail operating income was $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This 37% increase in operating income was primarily attributable to 28 Table of Contents increased in-store sales and improved retail fuel margins in our U.S. and Canadian retail operations, partially offset by higher selling expenses related mainly to retail reorganization expenses and an increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to 2007 executive retirement expenses, an increase in employee compensation and benefits, including incentive compensation, a $13 million termination fee paid in 2007 for the cancellation of our services agreement with NuStar Energy L.P., and increased charitable contributions, partially offset by 2006 expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel that were not incurred during 2007. “Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2007 included a $91 million pre-tax gain related to a foreign currency exchange rate gain resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary. “Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2006 included a pre-tax gain of $328 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding these effects, “other income, net” increased $54 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to increased interest income related to our significantly higher cash balance during 2007. Interest and debt expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $2.25 billion of notes in June 2007 to fund the accelerated share repurchase program (as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), increased interest on tax liabilities, and reduced capitalized interest due to a reduced balance of capital projects under construction. Income tax expense decreased $450 million from 2006 to 2007 mainly as a result of lower income from continuing operations before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to an increase in the percentage of pre-tax income contributed by the Aruba Refinery, the profits of which are non-taxable in Aruba through December 31, 2010, combined with favorable tax law changes. Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense, increased $493 million from the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2007 due primarily to a pre-tax gain of $827 million, or $426 million after tax, on the sale of the Lima Refinery in July 2007 combined with a $67 million increase in net income from the operations of the Lima Refinery between the two years. The increase in net income from the operations of the Lima Refinery was mainly attributable to a 94% increase in the refinery’s throughput margin per barrel, from $8.99 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $17.41 per barrel for the six months ended June 30, 2007, which more than offset the effect of a decline in throughput volumes resulting from only six months of operations in 2007 prior to its sale. 29 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2006 (a) 2005 (a) (b) Change Operating revenues (c) (d) $ 87,640 $ 80,616 $ 7,024 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales (b) (c) (d) 73,863 70,438 3,425 Refining operating expenses 3,622 2,816 806 Retail selling expenses (c) 719 700 19 General and administrative expenses 598 558 40 Depreciation and amortization expense: Refining 985 716 269 Retail 87 83 4 Corporate 44 37 7 Total costs and expenses 79,918 75,348 4,570 Operating income 7,722 5,268 2,454 Equity in earnings of NuStar Energy L.P. 45 41 4 Other income, net 350 53 297 Interest and debt expense: Incurred (377 ) (334 ) (43 ) Capitalized 165 66 99 Minority interest in net income of NuStar GP Holdings, LLC (7 ) -

(a) Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky. Therefore, the results of operations of the Lima Refinery are reported as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid-Continent region, exclude the Lima Refinery. (b) Includes the operations related to the Premcor Acquisition commencing on September 1, 2005. Cost of sales and refining operating income presented for the year ended December 31, 2005 include the effect of a $621 million LIFO charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying Valero’s LIFO accounting policy. This charge was excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented herein in order to make the information presented comparable between periods. (c) Certain amounts previously reported in 2006 and 2005 for operating revenues, cost of sales, retail selling expenses, and margin on miscellaneous sales have been reclassified for comparability with amounts reported in 2007. (d) Operating revenues and cost of sales both include approximately $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to certain crude oil buy/sell arrangements, which involve linked purchases and sales related to crude oil contracts entered into to address location, quality, or grade requirements. Commencing January 1, 2006, we adopted EITF Issue No. 04-13 which requires that such buy/sell arrangements be accounted for as one transaction, thereby resulting in no recognition of revenues and cost of sales for these transactions. (e) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (f) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (g) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (h) Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Northeast regions for the year ended December 31, 2006 include 287,000, 155,000, and 201,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor on September 1, 2005. Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Northeast regions for the year ended 33 Table of Contents December 31, 2005 include 78,000, 53,000, and 63,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor commencing on September 1, 2005. Throughput volumes for those acquired refineries for the 122 days of their operations subsequent to the acquisition date of September 1, 2005 were 234,000, 157,000, and 187,000 barrels per day, respectively, for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Northeast regions. (i) The information presented for the Mid-Continent region for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes the operations of the Denver Refinery, which was sold on May 31, 2005 to Suncor Energy (U.S.A.)

General Operating revenues increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from the former Premcor refinery operations. Operating income and income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating income increased $2.5 billion, or 47%, from 2005 to 2006 due to a $2.5 billion increase in the refining segment. The refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations exclude the operations of the Lima Refinery which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining Operating income for our refining segment increased from $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $8.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulting from a 15% increase in throughput volumes and an increase in refining throughput margin of $1.37 per barrel, or 12%, partially offset by increased refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense) of $1.1 billion. In addition, the increase in the 2006 results was partially attributable to the unfavorable impact in 2005 of a $621 million pre-tax LIFO charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying Valero’s LIFO accounting policy. The change in refining throughput margin for 2006 compared to 2005 was impacted by the following factors: • Throughput volumes increased 376,000 barrels per day during 2006 compared to 2005 due to 449,000 barrels per day of incremental throughput from the three former Premcor refineries, offset to some extent by the sale of the Denver Refinery in 2005 and significant planned and unplanned downtime at several of our refineries in 2006. • Overall, gasoline and distillate margins increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to significantly improved margins in the first half of 2006 attributable to increased foreign and U.S. demand, limited capacity additions, major industry turnaround activity, and continuing outages from the 2005 hurricanes. However, the 2006 increase in gasoline and distillate margins was somewhat diminished in the second half of 2006 due to excess refined product supply and the higher margins experienced in September and October of 2005 due to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. • Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks during 2006 were essentially unchanged from the strong differentials in 2005, and remained wide due to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for 34 Table of Contents gasoline and diesel and a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which resulted in higher utilization rates by refineries that require sweet crude oil as feedstock. • Throughput margin improved in 2006 due to the negative impact in 2005 of pre-tax losses of approximately $525 million on hedges related to forward sales of distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil. • Margins on secondary refined products such as petroleum coke and sulfur were lower in 2006 due to an increase in the price of crude oil from 2005 to 2006. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 29% higher for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to the Premcor Acquisition on September 1, 2005. Excluding the effect of the Premcor Acquisition, operating expenses increased 5% due mainly to increases in maintenance expense, employee compensation and related benefits, outside services, and catalyst and chemicals, partially offset by reduced energy costs. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 38% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the Premcor Acquisition, the implementation of new capital projects, and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $154 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This 18% increase in operating income was primarily attributable to improved retail fuel margins and increased in-store sales in the U.S. system. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, environmental expenses, and charitable contributions as well as the favorable resolution of a California excise tax dispute in 2005. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense and 2005 nonrecurring expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel. “Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2006 included a pre-tax gain of $328 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2005 to 2006 due to the effect of a full year of interest incurred in 2006 on the debt assumed in the Premcor Acquisition, partially offset by a reduction in other debt outstanding. Capitalized interest increased due to an increase in capital projects, including projects at the three former Premcor refineries. Income tax expense increased $990 million from 2005 to 2006 mainly as a result of a 55% increase in income from continuing operations before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased from the year ended December 31, 2005 as a lower percentage of our pre-tax income was contributed by the Aruba Refinery, the profits of which are non-taxable in Aruba through December 31, 2010. This increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the effects of new tax legislation in both Texas and Canada in 2006. 35 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Based on current forward market indicators, our outlook for refined product margins for the remainder of 2008 is positive. With respect to the gasoline market, winter-grade gasoline inventories increased in late 2007 and early 2008 in anticipation of the normal cycle of industry-wide plant maintenance that occurs in the first quarter. As spring maintenance activities occur, refined product supplies are expected to decline. In addition, the industry will soon be making the transition from winter-grade gasoline to summer-grade gasoline, which is more difficult and costly to produce due to more stringent specifications and thus generally contributes to a decline in inventories. Furthermore, we expect strong diesel margins to continue and provide an incentive to refiners to maximize diesel production, thereby further limiting gasoline supplies. These anticipated supply constraints, combined with a typical seasonal increase in demand, are expected to result in higher gasoline margins as the summer driving season approaches. Our outlook for on-road diesel margins is also favorable as on-road diesel demand continues to be good and on-road diesel inventory levels in 2008 are below 2007 levels on a days-of-supply basis. As a result, we expect on-road diesel margins to remain strong. In regard to feedstocks, sour crude oil differentials are expected to remain favorable during 2008. Residual fuel oil prices have not increased as much as crude oil prices, which should support wider differentials for sour crude oil since complex refiners can substitute residual fuel oil for a portion of their sour crude oil requirements if residual fuel oil becomes more economic to process than crude oil. In addition, new supplies of medium sour crude oil from the Gulf of Mexico in 2008 should contribute to continuing wide sour crude oil differentials. On January 25, 2008, our Aruba Refinery experienced a fire in its vacuum unit. We are in the process of making the necessary repairs and we resumed partial operation of the refinery in mid-February. We expect to resume full operations in the second quarter of 2008. Although we have not completed our assessment of the extent of damages, we do not believe that this incident will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for 2008. Regarding other operations for 2008, we began scheduled maintenance on our coker drums at our Port Arthur Refinery in the first quarter that will reduce throughput volumes in the Gulf Coast region for about three months beginning in early February. Otherwise, our turnaround schedule for 2008 is relatively light, which should benefit our results of operations during the year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $5.3 billion compared to $6.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under “Results of Operations” and a $900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales facility, as discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2007 due to a significant increase in gasoline, distillate, and crude oil prices at December 31, 2007 compared to such prices at the end of 2006. Cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Lima Refinery have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statement of cash flows for each period presented. Cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued operations was $260 million and 36 Table of Contents $215 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash used in investing activities related to the Lima Refinery was $14 million and $133 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2007, combined with $2.2 billion of proceeds from the issuance of long-term notes, $2.4 billion of proceeds from the sale of our Lima Refinery, a $311 million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized stock-based compensation cost, and $159 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans, were used mainly to: • fund $2.8 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • purchase 84.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $5.8 billion; • make an early long-term note redemption of $183 million and scheduled long-term note repayments of $280 million; • fund capital contributions, net of distributions, of $209 million to the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project mainly to enable the joint venture to redeem all of its outstanding debt; • fund contingent earn-out payments in connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and the Delaware City Refinery of $50 million and $25 million, respectively; • pay common stock dividends of $271 million; and • increase available cash on hand by $874 million. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $6.3 billion compared to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the significant increase in operating income discussed above under “Results of Operations,” partially offset by a $1.2 billion decrease from an unfavorable change in working capital between the years and a $1.0 billion increase in current income tax expense. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary difference in the working capital changes between the two years resulted from a favorable working capital change in 2005 attributable to a $400 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program and a decrease in restricted cash of approximately $200 million due to the repayment of certain debt assumed in the Premcor Acquisition using funds restricted for that purpose. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2006 due mainly to higher prices for gasoline and crude oil at December 31, 2006 compared to such prices at the end of 2005. Cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued operations was $215 million and $121 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash used in investing activities related to the Lima Refinery was $133 million and $42 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2006, combined with $880 million of proceeds from the sale of our ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, a $206 million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized stock-based compensation cost, and $122 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans, were used mainly to: • fund $3.8 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • purchase 34.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2.0 billion; • make long-term note repayments of $249 million; • fund $101 million of contingent earn-out payments in connection with the acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc., the St. Charles Refinery, and the Delaware City Refinery; • terminate our interest rate swap contracts for $54 million; 37 Table of Contents • pay common and preferred stock dividends of $184 million; and • increase available cash on hand by $1.2 billion. Capital Investments During the year ended December 31, 2007, we expended $2.3 billion for capital expenditures and $518 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $614 million of costs related to environmental projects. In addition, we expended $75 million for amounts due under contingent earn-out agreements. In connection with our acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the seller was entitled to receive payments in any of the seven years following this acquisition if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceeded a specified level (see the discussion in Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In connection with the Premcor Acquisition, we assumed Premcor’s obligation under a contingent earn-out agreement related to Premcor’s acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery from Motiva Enterprises LLC. Payments due under these earn-out arrangements were limited based on annual and aggregate limits. During 2007, we made earn-out payments of $50 million related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and $25 million related to the acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery (the maximum remaining payment based on the aggregate limitation under that agreement). In January 2008, we made a $25 million earn-out payment related to the St. Charles Refinery, which was the final payment based on the aggregate limitation under that agreement. For 2008, we expect to incur approximately $4.5 billion for capital investments, including approximately $4.1 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $575 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $400 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. In May and June of 2007, we made cash capital contributions of $190 million and $25 million, respectively, to the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project, representing our 50% portion of the amount required for the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline joint venture to redeem its fixed-rate notes and variable-rate debt, respectively. Our capital contributions, along with equal capital contributions from the other 50% joint venture partner, were used to redeem all of the joint venture’s outstanding debt. Lima Refinery Disposition Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $2.4 billion, including approximately $550 million from the sale of working capital to Husky, primarily related to the sale of inventory by our marketing and supply subsidiary. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $827 million, or $426 million after tax, which is presented in “income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense” in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with Husky under which we agreed to provide certain accounting and administrative services to Husky, with the services terminating by July 31, 2008. A significant portion of these services has been transitioned to Husky as of February 27, 2008. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Long-term debt and capital lease obligations $ 362 $ 215 $ 39 $ 424 $ 765 $ 5,114 $ 6,919 Operating lease obligations 384 282 188 110 54 190 1,208 Purchase obligations 27,378 7,056 858 707 540 2,113 38,652 Other long-term liabilities - 197 185 177 176 1,075 1,810 Total $ 28,124 $ 7,750 $ 1,270 $ 1,418 $ 1,535 $ 8,492 $ 48,589 Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations Payments for long-term debt and capital lease obligations in the table above reflect stated values and minimum rental payments, respectively. During February 2007, we redeemed our 9.25% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in 2010 for $183 million. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we made scheduled debt repayments of $280 million related to various notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2007, we borrowed $3 billion under a 364-day term credit agreement with a financial institution to fund the accelerated share repurchase program discussed in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2007, we repaid $500 million of the borrowings under the 364-day term credit agreement. The remaining balance of $2.5 billion was repaid in June 2007 using available cash and proceeds from the issuance of $2.25 billion of notes, as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2007, “current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations” as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet consisted primarily of our 9.5% senior notes with a stated value of $350 million and a maturity date of February 2013, which were redeemed in February 2008 as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of December 31, 2007, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: Rating Agency Rating Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook) Moody’s Investors Service Baa3 (positive outlook) Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook) Operating Lease Obligations Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. The operating lease obligations reflected in the table above have been reduced by related obligations that are included in “other long-term liabilities.” 39 Table of Contents Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short-term and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2007, our short-term and long-term purchase obligations increased by $7.0 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006. Other Long-term Liabilities Our “other long-term liabilities” are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2007. Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2007, our committed lines of credit were as follows: Borrowing Capacity Expiration Revolving credit facility $2.5 billion November 2012 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn. $115 million December 2012 As of December 31, 2007, we had $502 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities, $292 million of letters of credit outstanding under our committed revolving credit facility, and Cdn. $11 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Canadian committed revolving credit facility. These letters of credit expire during 2008 and 2009. Stock Purchase Programs During the first quarter of 2007, we had two stock purchase programs that had been previously approved by our board of directors. One program authorized our purchase of our common stock in open market transactions to satisfy employee benefit plan requirements and the other was a $2 billion common stock purchase program. Stock purchases under the programs are made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, subject to market conditions and other factors. The programs do not have a scheduled expiration date. On April 25, 2007, our board of directors approved an amendment to our $2 billion common stock purchase program to increase the authorized purchases under the program to $6 billion. In conjunction with the increase in our common stock purchase program, we entered into an agreement with a financial institution to purchase $3 billion of our shares under an accelerated share repurchase program, and in late April 2007, 42.1 million shares were purchased under this agreement. The purchase of these shares was funded with a short-term bridge loan, which we subsequently replaced with longer-term financing as described in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The cost of the shares purchased under the accelerated share repurchase program was to be adjusted, with the final purchase cost based on a discount to the average trading price of our 40 Table of Contents common stock, weighted by the daily volume of shares traded, during the program period. Any adjustment to the cost could be paid in cash or stock, at our option. The accelerated share repurchase program was completed on July 23, 2007, and we elected to pay in cash an additional $94 million for the shares purchased. This cash payment had a dilutive effect on our computation of earnings per common share from continuing operations assuming dilution for the year ended December 31, 2007 (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2007, we purchased 70.5 million shares of our common stock for $4.9 billion under our $6 billion common stock purchase program, including shares purchased under the accelerated share repurchase program discussed above, and 13.8 million shares for $915 million in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans. These purchases represented approximately 14% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2006. During 2008 (through February 22), we have purchased 4.9 million shares of our common stock for $317 million under our two stock purchase programs. On February 28, 2008, our board of directors approved a new $3 billion stock purchase program. This program is in addition to the $6 billion program discussed above. This new $3 billion program has no expiration date. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2007, we contributed $143 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 6.00% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2007, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 120% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2007. Although we have only $2 million of minimum required contributions to our qualified pension plans during 2008 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, we expect to use expected available cash to contribute approximately $100 million to our qualified plans during 2008. Environmental Matters As discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Tax Matters As discussed in Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive tax liabilities. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. Effective January 1, 2007, the Government of Aruba (GOA) enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods produced and services rendered in Aruba. The turnover tax, which is 3% for on-island sales and services and 1% on export sales, is being assessed by the GOA on sales by our Aruba Refinery. However, due to a previous tax holiday that was granted to our Aruba Refinery by the GOA through December 31, 2010 as well as other reasons, we believe that exports by our Aruba Refinery should not be subject to this turnover tax. No amounts have been accrued on exports with respect to this turnover tax. We have commenced arbitration 41 Table of Contents proceedings with the Netherlands Arbitration Institute pursuant to which we will seek to enforce our rights under the tax holiday. We have also filed protests of these assessments through proceedings in Aruba. Other During the first quarter of 2007, our McKee Refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit, resulting in business interruption losses for which we have submitted claims to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we received an immaterial initial payment from the insurance carriers on our claims, the proceeds from which were recorded as a reduction to “cost of sales.” No additional amount has been accrued related to these claims pending future settlements with the insurance carriers. In November 2007, we announced our plan to explore strategic alternatives related to our Aruba Refinery. In January 2008, we announced our plan to explore strategic alternatives related to our Memphis and Krotz Springs Refineries. Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from the public and private capital markets and bank markets, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Accounts Receivable Sales Facility As of December 31, 2007, we had an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables, which matures in August 2008. We use this program as a source of working capital funding. Under this program, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third-party financial institutions. We remain responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pay certain fees related to our sale of receivables under the program. During the third quarter of 2007, we reduced the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party financial institutions by $900 million. Therefore, as of December 31, 2007, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party financial institutions was $100 million. Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional discussion of the activity related to this program. Termination of this program would require us to obtain alternate working capital funding, which would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on our consolidated balance sheet. However, as of December 31, 2007, the termination of this program would not have had a material effect on our liquidity, particularly considering the reduction in the utilization of the program during 2007 as discussed above, and would not have affected our ability to comply with restrictive covenants in our credit facilities. We are not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity. 42 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long-lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method investments, and deferred tax assets) are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans. However, providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. Environmental Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, 43 Table of Contents additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes. The balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 is included in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that we have adequately accrued for our environmental exposures. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption is based on a review of long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2007 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2008 (in millions): Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Increase in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease $ 56 $ 15 Compensation rate increase 23 - Health care cost trend rate increase - 9 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease 7 1 Expected return on plan assets decrease 3 - Compensation rate increase 5 - Health care cost trend rate increase - 1 Tax Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad 44 Table of Contents valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. Legal Liabilities A variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. Although we have been successful in defending litigation in the past, we cannot be assured of similar success in future litigation due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the individual fact circumstances in each case. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). The carrying amount of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories was $3.9 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and the fair value of such inventories was $10.1 billion and $6.6 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. From time to time, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). We also use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. Finally, we enter into derivative commodity instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of 45 Table of Contents market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. See “Derivative Instruments” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures, and options. Our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy which has been approved by our board of directors. The following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including: • fair value hedges, which are used to hedge our recognized refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments (i.e., binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future); • cash flow hedges, which are used to hedge our forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; • economic hedges (hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges), which are used to: • manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, and • manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; and • derivative commodity instruments held or issued for trading purposes. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of “other comprehensive income” and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic hedges and for derivative instruments entered into by us for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. The following tables include only open positions at the end of the indicated reporting period, and therefore do not include amounts related to closed cash flow hedges for which the gain or loss remains in “accumulated other comprehensive income” pending consummation of the forecasted transactions. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. For futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period-end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. The pre-tax fair value for futures, swaps, and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. The pre-tax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the pre-tax fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options represents their strike price. 46 Table of Contents December 31, 2007 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Pre-tax Contract Pay Receive Contract Market Fair Volumes Price Price Value Value Value Fair Value Hedges: Futures - long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 68,873 $ 97.69 N/A $ 6,728 $ 6,961 $ 233 Futures - short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 79,188 N/A $ 96.89 7,673 8,005 (332 ) Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps - long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 18,175 81.44 98.50 N/A 310 310 Swaps - short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 18,175 102.55 86.25 N/A (296 ) (296 ) Futures - long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 80,960 103.50 N/A 8,379 8,596 217 Futures - short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 73,735 N/A 103.62 7,640 7,826 (186 ) Economic Hedges: Swaps - long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 12,012 33.16 39.48 N/A 76 76 Swaps - short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 7,397 63.91 54.25 N/A (71 ) (71 ) Futures - long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 77,902 96.20 N/A 7,494 7,802 308 Futures - short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 76,426 N/A 96.18 7,351 7,663 (312 ) Options - long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 89 47.72 N/A - 1 1 Trading Activities: Swaps - long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 14,677 11.77 12.98 N/A 18 18 Swaps - short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 15,952 12.47 11.56 N/A (15 ) (15 ) Futures - long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 28,801 98.01 N/A 2,823 2,923 100 Futures - short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 28,766 N/A 98.20 2,824 2,920 (96 ) Options - short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 66 N/A 49.00 1 1 - Total pre-tax fair value of open positions $ (45 ) 47 Table of Contents December 31, 2006 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Pre-tax Contract Pay Receive Contract Market Fair Volumes Price Price Value Value Value Fair Value Hedges: Futures - long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 15,261 $ 63.66 N/A $ 972 $ 949 $ (23 ) Futures - short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 22,091 N/A $ 64.56 1,426 1,379 47 Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps - long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 39,125 70.14 65.16 N/A (195 ) (195 ) Swaps - short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 39,125 69.66 76.30 N/A 260 260 Futures - long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 21,087 64.75 N/A 1,365 1,336 (29 ) Futures - short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 18,356 N/A 64.82 1,190 1,161 29 Economic Hedges: Swaps - long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 13,244 12.02 11.02 N/A (13 ) (13 ) 2007 (natural gas) 893 0.76 0.78 N/A - - Swaps - short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 7,605 26.47 27.66 N/A 9 9 2007 (natural gas) 833 0.85 0.89 N/A - - Futures - long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 50,442 64.28 N/A 3,242 3,171 (71 ) 2007 (natural gas) 400 7.33 N/A 3 3 - Futures - short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 51,623 N/A 64.15 3,312 3,252 60 2007 (natural gas) 400 N/A 8.21 3 3 - Options - long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 31 84.29 N/A - - - Options - short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 1,478 N/A 61.94 - (6 ) 6 Trading Activities: Futures - long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 801 77.29 N/A 62 59 (3 ) Futures - short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 801 N/A 84.87 68 58 10 Total pre-tax fair value of open positions $ 87 48 Table of Contents INTEREST RATE RISK In general, our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our long-term debt obligations. We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. In addition, we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged are recorded in interest expense. The recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and long-term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The following table provides information about our long-term debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented.

Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. As of December 31, 2007, we had commitments to purchase $507 million of U.S. dollars. Our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before January 29, 2008, resulting in a 2008 loss of $2 million. 49 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:44:45.168562

We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 25 Table of Contents OVERVIEW In this overview, we describe some of the primary factors that we believe affected our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2008. We reported a loss from continuing operations of $1.1 billion, or $2.16 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion, or $7.72 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The 2008 results included a charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 of $4.1 billion ($4.0 billion after tax) resulting from the impairment of goodwill. The goodwill impairment loss, which represented a write-off of the entire balance of our goodwill, was associated with a significant decline in our market capitalization in the fourth quarter of 2008 that resulted in large part from severe disruptions in the capital and commodities markets. In performing our goodwill impairment test under applicable accounting rules, we estimate fair value by discounting the estimated future cash flows from our refineries. The decline in our market capitalization during the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in the use of higher, risk-adjusted discount rates in determining the fair values of our reporting units, which reflected the significant risk premium implied by our stock price as of December 31, 2008. As a result of applying these higher discount rates to the cash flows of our reporting units, the fair values in each of our reporting units were below their net book values including goodwill, thus indicating potential impairment. Due to this conclusion of potential impairment, existing accounting rules required additional analysis for each of the reporting units to determine the amount of the loss, and this additional analysis indicated that all of the goodwill in each of our reporting units should be written off. Effective July 1, 2008, we sold our refinery in Krotz Springs, Louisiana to a subsidiary of Alon USA Energy, Inc. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $305 million, or $170 million after tax, as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net cash proceeds from the sale were $463 million, including approximately $135 million from the sale of working capital. In addition, we received contingent consideration in the form of a three-year earn-out agreement based on certain product margins. Our profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the “refined product margin.” The weakening of industry fundamentals for refined products that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 continued throughout 2008. Gasoline margins declined significantly in all of our refining regions in 2008 compared to 2007. The decline in margins was primarily due to a decrease in gasoline demand and an increase in ethanol production. Margins on certain secondary refined products, such as petroleum coke and petrochemical feedstocks, also declined during 2008 due to a significant increase in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks used to produce them. However, these decreases were partially offset by the effect of favorable diesel margins in 2008, which increased compared to 2007 primarily due to strong global demand. Because more than 65% of our total crude oil throughput consists of sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that historically have been purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil, our profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the “sour crude oil differential.” During 2008, sour crude oil differentials remained wide and improved somewhat in 2008 compared to 2007 levels. Regarding operations, on January 25, 2008, our Aruba Refinery was shut down due to a fire in its vacuum unit. We resumed partial operation of the refinery in mid-February, and during the second quarter of 2008 we completed the repairs and resumed full operations of the refinery. During the third quarter of 2008, certain of our refineries were shut down as a result of two hurricanes that impacted the Gulf Coast. 26 Table of Contents Although we avoided major damage from the hurricanes, repair costs and downtime attributable to the hurricanes and the Aruba downtime reduced our results of operations for 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.12 per share to $0.15 per share and purchased 23.0 million shares of our common stock under our board-authorized programs, which represented more than 4% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2008. We also redeemed $350 million of 9.5% callable debt that was due in 2013 and invested $3.2 billion in capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. 27 Table of Contents RESULTS OF

following notes relate to references on pages 28 through 31. (a) Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky Refining Company (Husky). Therefore, the results of operations of the Lima Refinery for the six months of 2007 prior to its sale, as well as the gain on the sale of the refinery, are reported as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid-Continent region, exclude the Lima Refinery. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $827 million ($426 million after tax), which is included in “Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense” for the year ended December 31, 2007. (b) Upon applying the goodwill impairment testing criteria under existing accounting rules during the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that the goodwill in all four of our reporting units was impaired, which resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of $4.1 billion ($4.0 billion after tax). This goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented for the year ended December 31, 2008 in order to make that information comparable between periods. (c) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (d) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (e) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs (for periods prior to its sale effective July 1, 2008), St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (f) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services – London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (g) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. 31 Table of Contents General Operating revenues increased 25% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices. Refined product prices were significantly higher in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the same period of 2007, but fourth quarter 2008 refined product prices declined to levels substantially below the fourth quarter of 2007. This resulted in a $10.1 billion decrease in fourth quarter 2008 revenues compared to 2007, which lowered the revenue increase for the year to $23.8 billion. Offsetting the higher revenues were substantially higher average feedstock costs. Operating income decreased $6.4 billion, or 92%, and income from continuing operations decreased $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to a $6.6 billion decrease in refining segment operating income. The decrease was primarily due to a goodwill impairment loss of $4.1 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 as discussed in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, see “Impairment of Assets” under “Critical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a detailed analysis of the methodology and assumptions used in the determination of this goodwill impairment loss. The goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and regional operating income amounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 for comparability purposes. The refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 exclude the operations of the Lima Refinery and the gain on its sale, which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery effective July 1, 2007 as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $797 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting mainly from the $4.1 billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above, a 12% decrease in throughput margin per barrel, a 12% increase in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense), and a 6% decline in throughput volumes. These decreases were partially offset by a $305 million gain on the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery effective July 1, 2008, which is discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Total refining throughput margins for 2008 compared to 2007 were impacted by the following factors: • Distillate margins in 2008 increased in all of our refining regions from the margins in 2007. The increase in distillate margins was primarily due to strong global demand. • Gasoline margins decreased significantly in all of our refining regions in 2008 compared to the margins in 2007. The decline in gasoline margins was primarily due to a decrease in gasoline demand and an increase in ethanol production. • Margins on various secondary refined products such as asphalt, fuel oils, propylene, and petroleum coke declined from 2007 to 2008 as prices for these products did not increase in proportion to the large increase in the costs of the feedstocks used to produce them. • Sour crude oil feedstock differentials to WTI crude oil in 2008 remained favorable and were wider than the differentials in 2007. These favorable differentials were attributable to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for gasoline and diesel. • Throughput volumes decreased 155,000 barrels per day during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a fire in the vacuum unit at our Aruba Refinery in January of 2008, downtime for 32 Table of Contents maintenance at our Port Arthur and Delaware City Refineries, unplanned downtime at our Port Arthur, Texas City, St. Charles, and Houston Refineries related to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery, and economic decisions to reduce throughputs in certain of our refineries as a result of unfavorable market fundamentals, partially offset by the 2007 shutdown of our McKee Refinery discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Throughput margin in 2008 included approximately $100 million related to the McKee Refinery business interruption settlement discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased $0.78 per barrel, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Per-barrel operating expenses increased mainly due to an increase in energy costs, as well as the effect of the throughput volume decline discussed above. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 9% from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This 48% increase in operating income was primarily attributable to a $0.055 per gallon increase in retail fuel margins and increased in-store sales in our U.S. retail operations. The significant improvement in fuel margins was largely the result of rapidly declining crude oil prices in the second half of 2008. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, decreased $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily due to lower variable incentive compensation expenses combined with the nonrecurrence of 2007 expenses related to executive retirement costs and a $13 million termination fee paid for the cancellation of our services agreement with NuStar Energy L.P. “Other income, net” decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to a $91 million foreign currency exchange rate gain in 2007 resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary, reduced interest income resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates, and a reduction in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets. These decreases were partially offset by income related to the Alon earn-out agreement discussed in Notes 2 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, lower costs incurred under our accounts receivable sales program, an increase in earnings from our equity investment in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company, and a $14 million gain in 2008 on the redemption of our 9.5% senior notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense decreased primarily due to reduced interest on tax liabilities, partially offset by higher average debt balances. Income tax expense decreased $694 million from 2007 to 2008 mainly as a result of lower operating income, excluding the effect on operating income of the $4.1 billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above that has an insignificant tax effect. Excluding this goodwill impairment loss, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was comparable to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007. 33 Table of Contents Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 represents a $426 million after-tax gain on the sale of the Lima Refinery effective July 1, 2007 and net income from its operations prior to the sale. 34 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2007 (a) 2006 (a) Change Operating revenues $ 95,327 $ 87,640 $ 7,687 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales 81,645 73,863 7,782 Refining operating expenses 4,016 3,622 394 Retail selling expenses 750 719 31 General and administrative expenses 638 598 40 Depreciation and amortization expense: Refining 1,222 985 237 Retail 90 87 3 Corporate 48 44 4 Total costs and expenses 88,409 79,918 8,491 Operating income 6,918 7,722 (804 ) Equity in earnings of NuStar Energy L.P.

(a) Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky. Therefore, the results of operations of the Lima Refinery are reported as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid-Continent region, exclude the Lima Refinery. (b) On December 22, 2006, we sold our remaining ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC (formerly Valero GP Holdings, LLC), which indirectly owned the general partner interest, the incentive distribution rights, and a 21.4% limited partner interest in NuStar Energy L.P. (formerly Valero L.P.). As a result, the financial highlights reflect no equity in earnings of NuStar Energy L.P. or minority interest in net income of NuStar GP Holdings, LLC subsequent to December 21, 2006. (c) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (d) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (e) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (f) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services – London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (g) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. (h) The market reference differential for ultra-low-sulfur diesel was not available prior to May 1, 2006, and therefore no market reference differential is presented for the year ended December 31, 2006. 38 Table of Contents General Operating revenues increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices. Operating income decreased $804 million, or 10%, and income from continuing operations decreased $722 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to an $827 million decrease in refining segment operating income. The refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations exclude the operations of the Lima Refinery, which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $8.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 resulting mainly from increased refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense) of $631 million. In addition, total throughput margin for the refining segment declined by $196 million due to a $0.14 per barrel decrease in refining throughput margin and lower throughput volumes. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased $0.40 per barrel, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating expenses increased mainly due to increases in maintenance expense, employee compensation and related benefits, outside services, and energy costs, as well as increased accruals for sales and use taxes. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24% from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects, increased turnaround and catalyst amortization, and the write-off of costs related to the McKee Refinery as a result of a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit in February 2007. Total refining throughput margins for 2007 compared to 2006 were impacted by the following factors: • Overall, gasoline and distillate margins relative to WTI increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a decline in refined product inventory levels resulting from unplanned refinery outages, lower imports, more stringent product specifications and regulations, and heavy industry turnaround activity, as well as moderately stronger demand. • Sour crude oil feedstock differentials to WTI crude oil during 2007 decreased from the strong differentials in 2006. However, other light, sweet crude oils priced at a premium to WTI in 2007; thus, sour crude oil feedstock differentials relative to those other light, sweet crude oils in 2007 were comparable to the wide differentials experienced in 2006. These wide differentials are attributable to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for gasoline and diesel and a global increase in refined product demand. • Margins on various secondary refined products such as asphalt, fuel oils, petroleum coke, and sulfur were lower in 2007 compared to 2006 as prices for these products did not increase in proportion to the costs of the feedstocks used to produce them. • Throughput volumes decreased 13,000 barrels per day during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a reduction in throughput volumes at our McKee Refinery as a result of the fire discussed above. 39 Table of Contents Retail Retail operating income was $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This 37% increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased in-store sales and improved retail fuel margins in our U.S. and Canadian retail operations, partially offset by higher selling expenses related mainly to retail reorganization expenses and an increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to 2007 executive retirement expenses, an increase in employee compensation and benefits, including incentive compensation, a $13 million termination fee paid in 2007 for the cancellation of our services agreement with NuStar Energy L.P., and increased charitable contributions, partially offset by 2006 expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel that were not incurred during 2007. “Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2007 included a $91 million pre-tax gain related to a foreign currency exchange rate gain resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary. “Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2006 included a pre-tax gain of $328 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding these effects, “other income, net” increased $54 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to increased interest income related to our significantly higher cash balance during 2007. Interest and debt expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $2.25 billion of notes in June 2007 to fund the accelerated share repurchase program (as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), increased interest on tax liabilities, and reduced capitalized interest due to a reduced balance of capital projects under construction. Income tax expense decreased $450 million from 2006 to 2007 mainly as a result of lower income from continuing operations before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to an increase in the percentage of pre-tax income contributed by the Aruba Refinery, the profits of which are non-taxable in Aruba through December 31, 2010, combined with favorable tax law changes. Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense, increased $493 million from the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2007 due primarily to a pre-tax gain of $827 million, or $426 million after tax, on the sale of the Lima Refinery in July 2007 combined with a $67 million increase in net income from the operations of the Lima Refinery between the two years. The increase in net income from the operations of the Lima Refinery was mainly attributable to a 94% increase in the refinery’s throughput margin per barrel, from $8.99 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $17.41 per barrel for the six months ended June 30, 2007, which more than offset the effect of a decline in throughput volumes resulting from only six months of operations in 2007 prior to its sale. 40 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Based on current forward market indicators, we expect both refined product margins and sour crude oil differentials for 2009 to be lower than the corresponding amounts reported in 2008. We expect the current economic slowdown to unfavorably impact demand for refined products. Although gasoline margins in the first quarter of 2009 have recovered somewhat from the negative margins experienced in late 2008, gasoline margins are expected to remain under pressure until demand begins to recover. Distillate margins are also expected to be unfavorably affected by reduced demand attributable to the current economic recession. We believe that distillate margins will continue to depend primarily on the pace of global economic activity and the rate at which new refining capacity is brought online. In regard to feedstocks, thus far in 2009, sour crude oil differentials have decreased from fourth quarter 2008 levels and are expected to remain lower for the first half of 2009. Reduced overall crude oil production by OPEC has caused a reduction in the supply of sour crude oil and a resulting increase in the price of such crude oils relative to sweet crude oils. In light of the current and expanding weakness in the U.S. and global economies, we expect 2009 will be a challenging year for the refining industry and our company. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.0 billion compared to $5.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under “Results of Operations,” after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss included in the 2008 operating income that had no effect on cash. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable decreased in 2008 due to a significant decrease in crude oil and refined product prices at December 31, 2008 compared to such prices at the end of 2007. Receivables for 2008 also decreased due to the termination in the first quarter of 2008 of certain agreements related to the sale of the Lima Refinery to Husky and the timing of receivable collections at year-end 2007. The change in working capital for 2007 includes a $900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales facility as discussed below in the discussion of 2007 versus 2006 cash flows. See the 2007 cash flow discussion below for information related to the cash flows of the discontinued operations of the Lima Refinery. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2008, combined with $1.5 billion of available cash on hand and $463 million of proceeds from the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery, were used mainly to: • fund $3.2 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • make an early redemption of our 9.5% senior notes for $367 million and scheduled debt repayments of $7 million; • purchase 23.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $955 million; • fund a $25 million contingent earn-out payment in connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery, an $87 million acquisition of retail fuel sites, and a $57 million acquisition primarily of an interest in a refined product pipeline; and • pay common stock dividends of $299 million. 41 Table of Contents Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $5.3 billion compared to $6.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under “Results of Operations” and a $900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales facility, as discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2007 due to a significant increase in gasoline, distillate, and crude oil prices at December 31, 2007 compared to such prices at the end of 2006. Cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Lima Refinery have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statement of cash flows for each period presented. Cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued operations was $260 million and $215 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash used in investing activities related to the Lima Refinery was $14 million and $133 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2007, combined with $2.2 billion of proceeds from the issuance of long-term notes, $2.4 billion of proceeds from the sale of our Lima Refinery, a $311 million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized stock-based compensation cost, and $159 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans, were used mainly to: • fund $2.8 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • purchase 84.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $5.8 billion; • make an early debt redemption of $183 million and scheduled debt repayments of $280 million; • fund capital contributions, net of distributions, of $209 million to the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company mainly to enable the joint venture to redeem all of its outstanding debt; • fund contingent earn-out payments in connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and the Delaware City Refinery of $50 million and $25 million, respectively; • pay common stock dividends of $271 million; and • increase available cash on hand by $874 million. Capital Investments During the year ended December 31, 2008, we expended $2.8 billion for capital expenditures and $408 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $479 million of costs related to environmental projects. In connection with our acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the seller was entitled to receive payments in any of the seven years following this acquisition if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceeded a specified level (see the discussion in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Payments due under this earn-out arrangement were limited based on annual and aggregate limits. In January 2008, we made a $25 million earn-out payment related to the St. Charles Refinery, which was the final payment based on the aggregate limitation under that agreement. Subsequent to this payment, we have no further commitments with respect to contingent earn-out agreements. For 2009, we expect to incur approximately $2.7 billion for capital investments, including approximately $2.2 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $635 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $490 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure 42 Table of Contents estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. Krotz Springs Refinery Disposition Effective July 1, 2008, we consummated the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery to Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc. (Alon), a subsidiary of Alon USA Energy, Inc. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $305 million, or $170 million after tax. Cash proceeds, net of certain costs related to the sale, were $463 million, including approximately $135 million from the sale of working capital to Alon primarily related to the sale of inventory by our marketing and supply subsidiary. In addition to the cash consideration received, we also received contingent consideration in the form of a three-year earn-out agreement based on certain product margins, which had a fair value of $171 million as of July 1, 2008. We have hedged the risk of a decline in the referenced product margins by entering into certain commodity derivative contracts. In addition, we entered into various agreements with Alon as further described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Debt and capital lease obligations $ 315 $ 39 $ 424 $ 765 $ 495 $ 4,619 $ 6,657 Operating lease obligations 397 272 174 84 51 257 1,235 Purchase obligations 12,812 2,507 1,589 1,208 623 1,752 20,491 Other long-term liabilities – 163 150 150 149 1,549 2,161 Total $ 13,524 $ 2,981 $ 2,337 $ 2,207 $ 1,318 $ 8,177 $ 30,544 Debt and Capital Lease Obligations Payments for debt and capital lease obligations in the table above reflect stated values and minimum rental payments, respectively. On February 1, 2008, we redeemed our 9.50% senior notes for $367 million, or 104.75% of stated value. In addition, in March 2008, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $7 million related to certain of our other debt. As of December 31, 2008, “current portion of debt and capital lease obligations” as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet consisted primarily of $200 million related to our 3.5% notes that matures in April 2009, $100 million of debt secured by certain of our accounts receivable that matures in June 2009 (discussed below), and the remaining $9 million of our 5.125% Series 1997D industrial revenue bonds that matures in April 2009. We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables. In June 2008, we amended the agreement to extend the maturity date from August 2008 to June 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party entities and financial institutions was $100 million; the proceeds from the sale are reflected as debt in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. The amount outstanding as of December 31, 2008 was repaid in February 2009. Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional discussion of this program. Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment 43 Table of Contents grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of December 31, 2008, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: Rating Agency Rating Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook) Moody’s Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook) Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook) We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings. Operating Lease Obligations Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. The operating lease obligations reflected in the table above have been reduced by related obligations that are included in “other long-term liabilities.” Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short-term and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2008, our short-term and long-term purchase obligations decreased by $18.2 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2007. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower crude oil and other feedstock prices at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007. Other Long-term Liabilities Our “other long-term liabilities” are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2008. 44 Table of Contents Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2008, our committed lines of credit were as follows: Borrowing Capacity Expiration Letter of credit facility $300 million June 2009 Letter of credit facility $275 million July 2009 Revolving credit facility $2.5 billion November 2012 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn. $115 million December 2012 In June 2008, we entered into a one-year committed revolving letter of credit facility under which we may obtain letters of credit of up to $300 million. In July 2008, we entered into another one-year committed revolving letter of credit facility under which we may obtain letters of credit of up to $275 million. Both of these credit facilities support certain of our crude oil purchases. We are being charged letter of credit issuance fees in connection with these letter of credit facilities. As of December 31, 2008, we had $201 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities, $431 million of letters of credit outstanding under our three U.S. committed revolving credit facilities, and Cdn. $19 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Canadian committed revolving credit facility. These letters of credit expire during 2009 and 2010. Stock Purchase Programs On February 28, 2008, our board of directors approved a new $3 billion common stock purchase program. This program is in addition to the remaining amount under the $6 billion program previously authorized. This new $3 billion program has no expiration date. As of December 31, 2008, we had made no purchases of our common stock under the new $3 billion program. As of December 31, 2008, we have approvals under these stock purchase programs to purchase approximately $3.5 billion of our common stock. During 2008, we purchased 18.0 million shares of our common stock for $667 million under our $6 billion common stock purchase program and 5.0 million shares for $288 million in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans. These purchases represented approximately 4% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2008. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2008, we contributed $110 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.40% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2008, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 76% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2008. The fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was in excess of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of December 31, 2007. However, due primarily to a significant decline in the fair value of the plan assets during 2008 resulting from unfavorable economic and market conditions, the qualified pension plans were underfunded as of December 31, 2008. Although we have only $8 million of minimum required contributions to our Qualified Plans during 2009 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, we plan to contribute approximately $130 million to our Qualified Plans during 2009. In January 2009, $50 million of this total expected contribution was contributed to our main Qualified Plan. Environmental Matters As discussed in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas 45 Table of Contents emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Tax Matters As discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive tax liabilities. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. Effective January 1, 2007, the Government of Aruba (GOA) enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods produced and services rendered in Aruba. The turnover tax, which is 3% for on-island sales and services and 1% on export sales, is being assessed by the GOA on sales by our Aruba Refinery. However, due to a previous tax holiday that was granted to our Aruba Refinery by the GOA through December 31, 2010 as well as other reasons, we believe that exports by our Aruba Refinery should not be subject to this turnover tax. Accordingly, no expense or liability has been recognized in our consolidated financial statements with respect to this turnover tax on exports. We commenced arbitration proceedings with the Netherlands Arbitration Institute pursuant to which we are seeking to enforce our rights under the tax holiday and other agreements related to the refinery. The arbitration hearing was held on February 3-4, 2009. We anticipate a decision sometime later this year. We have also filed protests of these assessments through proceedings in Aruba. In April 2008, we entered into an escrow agreement with the GOA and Caribbean Mercantile Bank NV (CMB), pursuant to which we agreed to deposit an amount equal to the disputed turnover tax on exports into an escrow account with CMB, pending resolution of the tax protest proceedings in Aruba. Under this escrow agreement, we are required to continue to deposit an amount equal to the disputed tax on a monthly basis until the tax dispute is resolved through the Aruba proceedings. Amounts deposited under this escrow agreement, which totaled $102 million as of December 31, 2008, are reflected as “restricted cash” in our consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the turnover tax described above, the GOA has also asserted other tax amounts aggregating approximately $25 million related to dividends and other tax items. The GOA, through the arbitration, is also now questioning the validity of the tax holiday generally, although the GOA has never issued any formal assessment for profit tax at any time during the tax holiday period. We believe that the provisions of our tax holiday agreement exempt us from all of these taxes and, accordingly, no expense or liability has been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. We are also challenging approximately $30 million in foreign exchange payments made to the Central Bank of Aruba as payments exempted under our tax holiday, as well as other reasons. These taxes and assessments are also being addressed in the arbitration proceedings discussed above. Other In July 2008, we entered into an agreement to participate as a prospective shipper on the 500,000 barrel-per-day expansion of the Keystone crude oil pipeline system, which is expected to be completed by 2012. Once completed, the pipeline will enable crude oil to be transported from Western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast at Port Arthur, Texas. In addition to our commitment to ship crude oil through the pipeline, we have an option to acquire an equity interest in the Keystone partnerships. We have also secured commitments from several Canadian oil producers to sell to us heavy sour crude oil for shipment through the pipeline. During the first quarter of 2007, our McKee Refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit, resulting in business interruption losses for which we submitted claims to our insurance 46 Table of Contents carriers under our insurance policies. We reached a settlement with the insurance carriers on our claims, resulting in pre-tax income of approximately $100 million in the first quarter of 2008 that was recorded as a reduction to “cost of sales.” On January 25, 2008, our Aruba Refinery was shut down due to a fire in its vacuum unit. During the second quarter, we completed the repairs and resumed full operations of the refinery. This incident reduced our operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008. In November 2007, we announced plans to explore strategic alternatives related to our Aruba Refinery. We are continuing to pursue potential transactions for this refinery, which may include the sale of the refinery. Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long-lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method investments, and deferred tax assets) are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. 47 Table of Contents Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings. Due to adverse changes in market conditions during the fourth quarter of 2008, as discussed further below in our discussion of goodwill, we evaluated our significant operating assets for potential impairment as of December 31, 2008, and we determined that the carrying amount of each of these assets was recoverable. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that management deems to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. In regard to goodwill, we have historically performed our goodwill impairment test as of October 1 of each year. However, during the fourth quarter of 2008, there were severe disruptions in the capital and commodities markets that contributed to a significant decline in our common stock price, thus causing our market capitalization to decline to a level substantially below our net book value. Because a low market capitalization relative to net book value represents a key indicator that goodwill may be impaired, we determined that goodwill needed to be evaluated for impairment as of December 31, 2008 in addition to our normal annual testing date. As of the date of this goodwill impairment evaluation, all of our goodwill was allocated among four reporting units, namely each of the four geographic regions of our refining segment (the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, Northeast, and West Coast regions). No goodwill was reported in our retail segment. Goodwill impairment testing is comprised of two steps. The first step (step 1) is to compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value, including any goodwill assigned to that reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required. If, however, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its recorded net book value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test (step 2) is required to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the estimated fair value derived for the reporting unit in step 1 is deemed to represent the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of that reporting unit. The fair values of each of the reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities are determined as they would be in a purchase business combination, and the excess of the deemed purchase price over the net fair value of all of the identifiable assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of the goodwill of that reporting unit. If the carrying amount of that reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds this implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to the implied fair value determined in this hypothetical purchase price allocation. 48 Table of Contents Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, the impairment testing rules required management to exercise its judgment to determine the estimated fair values of our four reporting units for purposes of performing step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Management considered the cyclicality of the refining business in deriving the set of prices that were applied to the anticipated charge and production volumes in each reporting unit. In determining the present values of each reporting unit’s cash flow streams, management utilized discount rates that were commensurate with the risks involved in the assets. To this applicable discount rate, management added a reasonable risk premium in order to consider the impact of volatility within the refining industry and current tightness in the capital markets on an investor’s required rate of return. An important requirement related to this fair value determination process is to reconcile the sum of the fair values determined for the various reporting units to our market capitalization. In order to perform this reconciliation, we first determined a fair value for our retail segment using an appropriate discount rate. Then we compared the sum of the fair values of the retail segment and the four refining reporting units to our total enterprise value, with our market capitalization determined based on our common stock price as of December 31, 2008. For this purpose, we also added a control premium to our market capitalization, in recognition of the fact that an acquiring entity generally is willing to pay more for equity ownership that gives it a controlling interest than an individual investor would pay for shares that constitute less than a controlling interest. The control premium that we added to our market capitalization represented a reasonable premium for acquisitions in our industry. Because the enterprise value, including the control premium, was comparable to the sum of the fair values determined above, we concluded that the assumptions utilized to determine the fair values of our reporting units were reasonable. The computed fair value of each of the reporting units was less than its net book value including goodwill, and therefore the goodwill in each of the reporting units was potentially impaired. We then applied step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to each of the reporting units, with the fair value for each reporting unit derived in step 1 constituting the assumed purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of each of those reporting units. In allocating value to the property, plant and equipment of each of the reporting units, we used current replacement costs for the refineries that comprised each reporting unit and applied a depreciation factor based on historical depreciation. We adjusted deferred income taxes based on the fair value assigned to property, plant and equipment and reflected the fair value of inventory and other working capital included in each reporting unit. Our calculations indicated that the net fair value of each reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities was significantly in excess of the deemed purchase price, and therefore no implied fair value of goodwill existed in any of the four reporting units. As a result, we concluded that an impairment of the entire amount of recorded goodwill was required, which resulted in a $4.1 billion pre-tax goodwill impairment loss, or $4.0 billion after tax, in the fourth quarter of 2008. Environmental Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental 49 Table of Contents laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes. The balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 is included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that each receive one of the two highest ratings given by the recognized rating agencies as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2008 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2009 (in millions): Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Increase in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease $ 66 $ 15 Compensation rate increase 28 – Health care cost trend rate increase – 9 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease 10 1 Expected return on plan assets decrease 4 – Compensation rate increase 6 – Health care cost trend rate increase – 1 Tax Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and 50 Table of Contents different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. Legal Liabilities A variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. Although we have been successful in defending litigation in the past, we cannot be assured of similar success in future litigation due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the individual fact circumstances in each case. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). From time to time, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). We also use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in income. Finally, we enter into derivative commodity instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. See “Derivative Instruments” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures, and options. Our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. 51 Table of Contents The following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including: Fair Value Hedges – Fair value hedges are used to hedge certain recognized refining inventories (which had a carrying amount of $4.4 billion and $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and a fair value of $5.1 billion and $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively) and our unrecognized firm commitments (i.e., binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future). The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period. Cash Flow Hedges – Cash flow hedges are used to hedge certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of “other comprehensive income” and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. Economic Hedges – Economic hedges are hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges that are used to: – manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, – manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; and – manage price volatility in the referenced product margins associated with the Alon earn-out agreement as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The derivative instruments related to economic hedges are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. Trading Activities – These represent derivative commodity instruments held or issued for trading purposes. The derivative instruments entered into by us for trading activities are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. The following tables include only open positions at the end of the reporting period. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. For futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period-end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. The pre-tax fair value for futures, swaps, and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. The pre-tax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the pre-tax fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions.

We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. In addition, we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged are recorded in interest expense. The recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and debt balances are adjusted accordingly. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. The following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented.

Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. As of December 31, 2008, we had commitments to purchase $280 million of U.S. dollars. Our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before January 30, 2009, resulting in a 2009 gain of $2 million. 56 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:44:48.820540

These results were primarily due to our refining segment operations, which generated operating income of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to operating income of $247 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in refining operating income was primarily due to improved margins for the distillate products we produce and wider sour crude oil differentials. The sour crude oil differential is the difference between the price of sweet crude oil and the price of sour crude oil. We believe that the improved distillate margins are due to an increase in the demand for refined products resulting from the improving U.S. and worldwide economies. Although improving, refined product demand has not returned to levels experienced prior to the economic slowdown that began in 2008. Excess worldwide refinery capacity and high levels of refined product inventories continue to constrain refined product margins. In response to the worldwide economic slowdown, and as a result of our assessment of the operating performance and profitability of our refineries, we temporarily shut down our Aruba Refinery in July 2009 and permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery in November 2009. In June 2010, we sold our shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets for $220 million of cash proceeds, and in December 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery and associated inventory for $547 million of cash proceeds and a $160 million one-year note. Our Aruba Refinery remained idle throughout 2010, but in the third quarter of 2010, we began refinery-wide maintenance to prepare the refinery’s production units for restart due to improved sour crude oil differentials and a general improvement in refining economics. The Aruba Refinery resumed operations in January 2011. Our retail segment generated operating income of $346 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to operating income of $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The 2010 results benefited from the blending of ethanol into gasoline sold by our retail segment. For most of 2010, ethanol was a lower cost product than gasoline and this lower cost results in an increase in retail fuel margins. During the latter part of 2010, the difference between the cost of gasoline and the cost of ethanol began to narrow and the benefit that our retail segment experienced through most of 2010 from the blending of ethanol into gasoline narrowed. Should this trend continue in 2011, our retail fuel margins may be negatively impacted as compared to 2010. In the second quarter of 2009, we entered the ethanol business through the acquisition of seven ethanol facilities, and we acquired three additional facilities in the first quarter of 2010. We believe that ethanol is a natural fit for us because we manufacture transportation fuels. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our ethanol segment generated operating income of $209 million, compared to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The ethanol business is dependent on margins between ethanol and corn feedstocks and can be impacted by U.S. government subsidies and biofuels (including ethanol) mandates. To support our financial strength and liquidity, we issued $1.25 billion in debt during the first quarter of 2010 at interest rates favorable to those on our existing debt. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem $484 million of debt with a higher interest rate, and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. In December 2010, we received proceeds of $300 million under a financing agreement associated with the issuance of $300 million of Gulf Opportunity Zone Revenue Bonds (GO Zone Bonds). In February 2011, we paid $300 million to acquire the GO Zone Bonds, which we expect to hold and reissue in future years to help fund the construction costs of a capital project at our St. Charles Refinery. 25Table of ContentsWe expect the U.S. and worldwide economies to continue to recover slowly, and we expect refined product demand to increase. The increase in anticipated refined product demand is expected to result in an increase in crude oil production, which we believe will result in the production of more sour crude oils and continued improvement in sour crude oil differentials. The expected increases in refined product demand and sour crude oil production should favorably impact our refined product margins. However, we expect that the current excess global refining capacity will put pressure on refining margins and could result in ongoing production constraints or refinery shutdowns in the refining industry. We will continue to optimize our refining assets based on market conditions. 26Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market prices that directly impact our operations.

The results of operations of the refinery, including the loss on the sale, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and Northeast Region operating highlights exclude the Paulsboro Refinery for both years presented.(b) During the fourth quarter of 2009, we permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery and wrote down the book value of the refinery assets to net realizable value, resulting in a pre-tax loss on the shutdown of $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after taxes). On June 1, 2010, we sold the shutdown refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets to wholly owned subsidiaries of PBF Energy Partners LP (PBF) for $220 million of cash proceeds, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of the refinery assets of $92 million ($58 million after taxes) and an insignificant gain on the sale of the terminal and pipeline assets. The results of operations of the shutdown refinery, including the gain on the sale in 2010 and the loss on the shutdown in 2009, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and Northeast Region operating highlights exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years presented. The terminal and pipeline assets associated with the refinery were not shut down in 2009 and continued to be operated until they were sold; the results of these operations are reflected in continuing operations for both years presented.(c) We acquired three ethanol plants in the first quarter of 2010 and seven ethanol plants in the second quarter of 2009. The information presented includes the results of operations of those plants commencing on their respective acquisition or closing dates. Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during each year divided by actual calendar days per year.(d) Credit card transactions processing fees incurred by our retail segment of $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 have been reclassified from retail operating expenses to cost of sales. The Retail–U.S. and Retail–Canada operating highlights 31Table of Contentshave been restated to reflect this reclassification.(e) The asset impairment loss relates primarily to the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects classified as “construction in progress” as a result of the unfavorable impact of the economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel.(f) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes.(g) Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.(h) The refining regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City Refinery; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.(i) A loss contingency accrual of $140 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute with the Government of Aruba (GOA) regarding a turnover tax on export sales as well as other tax matters. The portion of the loss contingency accrual that relates to the turnover tax was recorded in cost of sales during the year ended December 31, 2009, and therefore is included in refining operating income (loss) but has been excluded in determining throughput margin per barrel. GeneralOperating revenues increased 27 percent (or $17.6 billion) for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices between the two years. Operating income increased $1.8 billion and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to a $1.7 billion increase in refining segment operating income discussed below. RefiningOperating income for our refining segment increased from $247 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to an overall improvement in operating results of $1.3 billion (discussed below), reduced asset impairment losses of $218 million, and the nonrecurrence of a $114 million loss contingency accrual in 2009. The asset impairment loss recorded in 2009 related to our decision to permanently cancel certain construction projects in response to the economic slowdown that began in 2008. We continue to evaluate our ongoing construction projects, but the number and significance of projects cancelled has substantially declined in 2010. The loss contingency accrual recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in Aruba. The $1.3 billion improvement in operating results was primarily due to a 30 percent increase in throughput margin per barrel (an overall $1.80 per barrel increase between the comparable years). The increase in throughput margin per barrel was caused by a significant improvement in distillate margins and petrochemical (primarily propylene) margins, but those improvements were somewhat offset by a decline in gasoline margins in two of our refining regions. Throughput margin per barrel also benefited from wider sour crude oil differentials. The impact of these factors on our throughput margin per barrel is described below. Changes in the margin that we receive for our products have a material impact on our results of operations. For example, the benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel, which is a type of distillate, was $11.14 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $8.02 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a favorable increase of $3.12 per barrel. Similar increases in distillate margins were experienced in other regions. We estimate that the increase in margin for distillates had an $820 million positive impact to our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced 712,000 barrels per day of distillates during the year ended December 31, 2010. Similarly, the benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast propylene was $7.92 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to a negative margin of $1.31 for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a favorable increase of $9.23 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in margin for petrochemicals (primarily propylene) had a $199 million positive impact on our refining margin, year over year. Distillate and propylene margins 32Table of Contentswere higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to an increase in the industrial demand for these products resulting from the ongoing recovery of the U.S. and worldwide economies and exports. The benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast Conventional 87 gasoline (Gulf Coast 87 gasoline) was $7.51 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $7.61 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing an unfavorable decrease of $0.10 per barrel. CARBOB 87 gasoline benchmark reference margins decreased year over year to an even greater extent in the West Coast region (a $1.87 per barrel unfavorable decrease). We estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins had a $119 million negative impact to our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced 1.05 million barrels per day of gasoline during the year ended December 31, 2010. Gasoline margins were lower in 2010 as compared to 2009 despite an increase in gasoline prices during 2010. We believe that the margins for gasoline were constrained due to continued weak consumer demand and high levels of inventory. In addition, our downstream customers increased the use of ethanol as a component in transportation fuels because its price was lower than the price of gasoline. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the differential applicable to the price of sour crude oil as compared to the price of sweet crude oil was wider than the differential for the year ended December 31, 2009. For example, Maya crude oil, which is a type of sour crude oil, sold at a discount of $9.13 per barrel to WTI crude oil, a type of sweet crude oil, during the year ended December 31, 2010. This compares to a discount of $5.19 per barrel during the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a favorable increase of $3.94 per barrel. The benefit of this wider differential, however, was offset by a reduction of 30,000 barrels per day of sour crude oil that we processed during 2010 as compared to 2009. We estimate that the wider differentials for all types of sour crude oil that we process, offset by reduced throughput volumes, had a $196 million positive impact to our overall refining margin for 2010 as we processed 844,000 barrels per day of sour crude oils. RetailRetail operating income was $346 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This 18 percent (or $53 million) increase was primarily due to increases in retail fuel margins of $57 million and merchandise margins of $27 million, partially offset by a $28 million increase in operating expenses. Retail fuel margins are affected by the blending of ethanol with the gasoline sold by our retail segment. For most of 2010, ethanol was a lower cost product than gasoline and this lower cost resulted in an increase in retail fuel margins. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) price for a gallon of ethanol was $0.23 less than a gallon of Gulf Coast 87 gasoline for the year ended December 31, 2010, but there was little difference between the prices of these products for the year ended December 31, 2009. We estimate that the lower cost of ethanol had a $32 million positive impact to our U.S. retail fuel margins for 2010 as approximately 80 percent of the gasoline we sold during the year ended December 31, 2010 contained 10 percent ethanol. Retail fuel margins in our Canadian retail operations increased by $27 million due to the favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. On average, Cdn$1 was equal to $0.96 during 2010 compared to $0.88 in 2009, representing an increase in value of nine percent. Retail merchandise margins increased due to increased product pricing combined with improved product mix, and a favorable impact from the stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009, as described above. 33Table of ContentsThe increase in operating expenses was also due to the stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. The stronger Canadian dollar had a $21 million unfavorable impact on the 2010 operating expenses of our Canadian retail operations compared to 2009. EthanolEthanol operating income was $209 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase of $44 million was primarily due to a full year of operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the second quarter of 2009 and the addition of three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to a favorable settlement with an insurance company for $40 million recorded in 2010, which offset an increase in litigation costs of $40 million recorded in 2009. After adjusting for these items, the $40 million increase in general and administrative expenses year over year resulted from an increase of $21 million for incentive compensation expenses and an increase of $18 million for environmental remediation expenses. “Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $89 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 due to a pre-tax gain of $55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (CHOPS) in November 2010 and the effect of a $42 million loss in 2009 on changes in the fair values of an earn-out agreement and associated derivative instruments that were entered into in connection with the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery in 2008. Interest and debt expense increased $68 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase is composed of a $53 million increase in interest incurred on $1.25 billion of debt issued in February 2010 and $1.0 billion of debt issued in March 2009 (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and a $15 million decrease in capitalized interest due to a reduction in capital expenditures between the years and the temporary suspension of activity on certain construction projects. We do not capitalize interest with respect to suspended construction projects until significant construction activities resume. We anticipate that significant construction activities will resume on certain construction projects in 2011. Income tax expense increased $618 million from a $43 million benefit in 2009 to $575 million of expense in 2010 mainly as a result of higher operating income in 2010. “Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” decreased $1.1 billion from the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to the after-tax loss of $1.2 billion related to the permanent shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009. The results of operations for the Paulsboro and Delaware City Refineries, including the loss and gain, respectively, on their sales, are reflected in “Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” as discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 34Table of Contents2009 Compared to 2008 Financial Highlights (a) (b) (c)(millions of dollars, except per share amounts)

17, 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery and associated inventory to PBF Holding. The results of operations of the refinery have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and Northeast Region operating highlights exclude the Paulsboro Refinery for both years presented.(b) During the fourth quarter of 2009, we permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery and wrote down the book value of the refinery assets to net realizable value, resulting in a pre-tax loss on the shutdown of $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after taxes). The results of operations of the shutdown refinery, including the loss on the shutdown in 2009, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and Northeast Region operating highlights exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years presented. (c) We acquired seven ethanol plants in the second quarter of 2009. The information presented for 2009 includes the results of operations of these plants commencing on their respective closing dates. Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during 2009 divided by actual calender days in 2009.(d) Credit card transactions processing fees incurred by our retail segment of $76 million and $92 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, have been reclassified from retail operating expenses to cost of sales. The Retail–U.S. and Retail–Canada operating highlights have been restated to reflect this reclassification.(e) The asset impairment loss relates primarily to the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects classified as “construction in progress” as a result of the unfavorable impact of the economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel.(f) On July 1, 2008, we sold our Krotz Springs Refinery to Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc. (Alon). The nature and significance of our post-closing participation in an offtake agreement with Alon represents a continuation of activities with the Krotz Springs Refinery for accounting purposes, and as such the results of operations related to the Krotz Springs Refinery have not been presented as discontinued operations. In addition, all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Gulf Coast 39Table of Contentsregion, include the Krotz Springs Refinery for the year ended December 31, 2008. The pre-tax gain of $305 million on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery is included in the Gulf Coast operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 but is excluded from the per-barrel operating highlights.(g) During the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that the goodwill in all four of our refining segment reporting units was impaired, which resulted in a pre-tax and after-tax goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion related to continuing operations. This goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts for the year ended December 31, 2008.(h) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes.(i) Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.(j) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs (for periods prior to its sale on July 1, 2008), St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City Refinery and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.(k) A loss contingency accrual of $140 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute with the GOA regarding a turnover tax on export sales as well as other tax matters. The portion of the loss contingency accrual that relates to the turnover tax was recorded in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, and therefore is included in refining operating income (loss) but has been excluded in determining throughput margin per barrel. GeneralOperating revenues decreased 39 percent (or $42.1 billion) for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating income decreased by $448 million and income from continuing operations before taxes decreased by $600 million over the same period. These decreases were primarily the result of the negative impact of the U.S. and worldwide economic slowdown on the demand and prices for our refined products. The economic slowdown began in late 2008 and persisted throughout 2009. The decreases in operating income and income from continuing operations before taxes, however, were significantly affected by the $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss and the $305 million gain on the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery that we recorded in 2008. Excluding these two items, operating income and income from continuing operations before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, from the prior year. These decreases were primarily related to our refining segment, which experienced a $518 million decrease in operating income in 2009 compared to 2008 (a $4.3 billion decrease after excluding the effect of the goodwill write-off and other items) as discussed below. RefiningOperating income for our refining segment decreased from $765 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 to $247 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, due to a decrease in operating results of $4.3 billion (discussed below), a reduced goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion, an increased asset impairment loss of $134 million, and an increased loss contingency accrual of $114 million. The goodwill impairment loss related to our determination in 2008 that our goodwill was impaired, which was based on the significant decline in our equity market capitalization. That decline was caused by severe disruptions in the U.S. and worldwide capital and commodities markets in 2008 and the resulting economic slowdown. The asset impairment loss of $220 million and $86 million reported in 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to our decision to permanently cancel certain construction projects in response to the economic slowdown that began in 2008. The loss contingency accrual recorded in 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in Aruba. The $4.3 billion decrease in operating results was primarily due to a 46 percent decrease in throughput margin per barrel (a $5.16 per barrel decrease between the comparable years) and an 8 percent decrease in throughput volumes (an 186,000 barrel per day decrease between the comparable years). The decreases were primarily the result of the negative impact of the economic slowdown on the demand for and prices of refined products. The decrease in throughput margin per barrel was caused by a significant decrease in distillate margins, but 40Table of Contentsthe decrease in distillate margins was somewhat offset by an increase in gasoline margins in all of our refining regions. Throughput margin per barrel was also negatively impacted by narrow sour crude oil differentials. The impact of these factors on our throughput margin per barrel is described below. Changes in the margin we receive for our products have a material impact on our results of operations. For example, the benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel was $8.02 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $22.96 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing an unfavorable decrease of $14.94 per barrel. We experienced similar decreases in distillate margins in other regions. We estimate that the decrease in distillate margins negatively impacted our overall refining margin by $4.4 billion, as we produced 692,000 barrels per day of distillates during the year ended December 31, 2009. The benchmark reference margin for Gulf Coast 87 gasoline was $7.61 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $4.85 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing a favorable increase of $2.76 per barrel. CARBOB 87 gasoline benchmark reference margins increased year over year to an even greater extent in the West Coast region (a $5.82 per barrel favorable increase). We estimate that the increase in gasoline margins had a $1.0 billion favorable impact to our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced 1.04 billion barrels per day of gasoline during the year ended December 31, 2009. Gasoline margins were higher in 2009 as compared to 2008 despite a decrease in gasoline prices during 2009. We believe that the margins for gasoline improved due to a greater percentage decrease in the cost of crude oil as compared to the percentage decrease in the price of gasoline.In addition, the margins we received for other products, such as petroleum coke and sulfur, for the year ended December 31, 2009 improved by $2.1 billion as compared to 2008. We believe that the margins were higher in 2009 due to the decrease in the cost of crude oil in 2009 as compared to 2008. For example, the benchmark reference price of WTI crude oil was $61.69 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $99.56 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing a decrease of $37.87 per barrel. Because the prices for these other products are not significantly influenced by the cost of crude oil, changes in the cost of crude oil have a significant effect of the margins we receive for these products.For the year ended December 31, 2009, the differential applicable to the price of sour crude oil as compared to the price of sweet crude oil was lower than the differential for the year ended December 31, 2008. For example, Maya crude oil, which is a type of sour crude oil, sold at a discount of $5.19 per barrel to WTI crude oil, a type of sweet crude oil, during the year ended December 31, 2009. This compared to a discount of $15.71 per barrel during the year ended December 31, 2008, representing an unfavorable decrease of $10.52 per barrel. However, this narrower differential in 2009 was offset by a reduction of 174,000 barrels per day of sour crude oil that we processed during 2009 as compared to 2008, which resulted primarily from the temporary shutdown of our Aruba Refinery commencing in July 2009. We estimate that the narrower differentials for all types of sour crude oil that we process, offset by reduced throughput volumes, negatively impacted our overall refining margin for 2009 by $2.6 billion as we processed 874,000 barrels per day of sour crude oils. Refining operating expenses were 23 percent lower (or $851 million) for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a decrease of $490 million in energy costs, a decrease of $171 million in maintenance expenses, a decrease of $48 million in sales and use taxes, and a decrease of $43 million resulting from no longer operating the Krotz Springs Refinery, which was sold in 2008. 41Table of ContentsRetailRetail operating income was $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This 21 percent decrease (or $76 million) was primarily due to decreased retail fuel margins of $124 million, offset by a $50 million decrease in operating expenses. The decrease in retail fuel margins was due to the effect of significantly higher margins in 2008. The higher margins in 2008 were caused by a decrease in the supply of fuel in connection with the temporary shutdown of refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Ike during the third quarter of 2008. Many of those refineries became operational by the fourth quarter of December 2008, and fuel supply and margins returned to normal levels. There were no similar events that occurred in 2009.The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a $24 million decrease in bad debt expense and a decrease in operating expenses due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2009 compared to 2008. On average, Cdn.$1 was equal to $0.88 during 2009 compared to $0.95 during 2008, representing a decrease in value of seven percent. The weaker Canadian dollar had an $18 million favorable impact on the 2009 operating expenses of our Canadian retail operations compared to 2008. EthanolEthanol operating income was $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which represents the operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the second quarter of 2009, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not own or operate any ethanol plants prior to this acquisition. Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses increased $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 mainly due to an increase of $39 million in litigation costs, an increase of $10 million in severance expenses, and acquisition costs of $10 million related to the acquisition of seven ethanol plants. These increases were partially offset by reductions of $29 million in environmental remediation expenses and $16 million in professional fees. “Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $96 million from the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a $128 million unfavorable change in fair value adjustments related to the Alon earn-out agreement and associated derivative instruments as discussed in Notes 20 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, reduced interest income of $37 million resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates, and a $14 million gain recognized in 2008 on the redemption of our 9.5% senior notes as discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These decreases were partially offset by a $55 million increase in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets and $27 million of income resulting from the reversal of an accrual for potential payments related to a prior acquisition in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations. Interest and debt expense increased $56 million mainly due to interest incurred on $1.0 billion of notes issued in March 2009. Income tax expense decreased $1.5 billion from $1.4 billion of expense in 2008 to a $43 million benefit in 2009 mainly as a result of lower operating income in 2009 and the nondeductibility of a significant portion of the $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss in 2008. “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $1.7 billion from the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the $1.2 billion after tax loss on the permanent shut down of our Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009. 42Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2010Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3.0 billion compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the receipt of a $923 million tax refund in 2010. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2010 due to significant increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of 2010 compared to such prices at the end of 2009. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2010, combined with $1.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 4.50% notes due in February 2015, $850 million of 6.125% notes due in February 2020, and $300 million of GO Zone Bonds as discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $547 million of proceeds from the Paulsboro Refinery sale, $220 million of proceeds from the sale of the shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets, and $330 million of proceeds from the sale of our 50 percent interest in CHOPS as discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, were used mainly to:• fund $2.3 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • redeem our 7.5% senior notes for $294 million and our 6.75% senior notes for $190 million;• make scheduled long-term note repayments of $33 million;• make net repayments under our accounts receivable sales facility of $100 million;• pay common stock dividends of $114 million; • purchase additional ethanol facilities for $260 million; and• increase available cash on hand by $2.5 billion. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2009Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.8 billion compared to $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the $4.2 billion decrease in operating income discussed above under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,” after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss and gain on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery, both of which had no effect on cash flows from operating activities. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.6 billion favorable change in the amount of income tax payments and refunds in 2008 and 2009 and a net $1.4 billion favorable effect from changes in receivables, inventories, and accounts payable between the two years. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2009 due to significant increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of 2009 compared to such prices at the end of 2008. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2009, combined with $998 million of proceeds from the issuance of $1.0 billion of notes in March 2009 as discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $799 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 46 million shares of common stock in June 2009 as discussed in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $100 million of additional proceeds from the sale of receivables, and $115 million of available cash on hand were used mainly to:• fund $2.7 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;• fund the acquisition of seven ethanol plants for $556 million;• make scheduled long-term note repayments of $285 million; and• pay common stock dividends of $324 million. 43Table of ContentsCash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Paulsboro and Delaware City Refineries have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statements of cash flows for all years presented and are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008Cash provided by (used in) operating activities: Paulsboro Refinery$88 $10 $246 Delaware City Refinery(26) (126) 81 Cash used in investing activities: Paulsboro Refinery(41) (121) (212)Delaware City Refinery— (153) (268) Capital InvestmentsDuring the year ended December 31, 2010, we expended $1.7 billion for capital expenditures and $535 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $740 million of costs related to environmental projects. For 2011, we expect to incur approximately $2.9 billion for capital investments, including approximately $2.4 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $260 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $510 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to future strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. In January 2010, we acquired two ethanol plants and inventories for a total purchase price of $202 million. The plants are located in Linden, Indiana and Bloomingburg, Ohio. In February 2010, we acquired an additional ethanol plant located near Jefferson, Wisconsin plus certain receivables and inventories for a total consideration of $79 million. Of the $281 million of total consideration paid for these acquisitions, $21 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2009. On June 1, 2010, we sold the shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets to PBF for $220 million of cash proceeds, and on December 17, 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery to PBF Holding for $547 million of cash proceeds and a $160 million one-year note secured by the Paulsboro Refinery. 44Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 are summarized below (in millions).

On February 1, 2011, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $210 million related to our 6.75% senior notes. On February 2, 2011, we paid $300 million to acquire the GO Zone Bonds, which were subject to mandatory tender on that date. We expect to hold the GO Zone Bonds for our own account until conditions permit the remarketing of these bonds at an interest rate acceptable to us. We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1.0 billion of eligible trade receivables, which matures in June 2011. As of December 31, 2010, the amount of eligible receivables sold was $100 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we reduced the net eligible receivables sold under this program by $100 million. Proceeds from the sale of receivables under this facility are reflected as debt. 45Table of ContentsOur agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of December 31, 2010, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: Rating AgencyRatingStandard & Poor’s Ratings ServicesBBB (negative outlook)Moody’s Investors ServiceBaa2 (negative outlook)Fitch RatingsBBB (negative outlook) We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings. Operating Lease ObligationsOur operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined product and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short-term and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2010, our short-term and long-term purchase obligations increased by $6.4 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. Other Long-term LiabilitiesOur other long-term liabilities are described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2010. 46Table of ContentsOther Commercial CommitmentsAs of December 31, 2010, our committed lines of credit were as follows: BorrowingCapacityExpirationOutstandingLetters of CreditLetter of credit facility$200 millionJune 2011$ -Letter of credit facility$300 millionJune 2011$100 millionRevolving credit facility$2.4 billionNovember 2012$399 millionCanadian revolving credit facilityCdn. $115 millionDecember 2012Cdn. $20 million As of December 31, 2010, we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities. The letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2010 expire during 2011 and 2012. Stock Purchase ProgramsAs of December 31, 2010, we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately $3.5 billion of our common stock. Pension Plan Funded StatusDuring 2010, we contributed $50 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.40 percent discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2010, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 95 percent of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2010. We have no minimum required contributions to our pension plans during 2011 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; however, we plan to contribute approximately $100 million to our pension plans during 2011. Environmental Matters We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. While debate continues in the U.S. Congress regarding greenhouse gas legislation, the regulation of greenhouse gases at the federal level has now shifted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which began regulating greenhouse gases on January 2, 2011 under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act). According to statements by the EPA, any new construction or material expansions will require that, among other things, a greenhouse gas permit be issued at the state or federal level in accordance with the Clean Air Act and regulations, and we will be required to undertake a technology review to determine appropriate controls to be implemented with the project in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The determination will be on a case by case basis, and the EPA has provided only general guidance on which controls will be required. Any such controls, however, could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 47Table of ContentsIn addition, certain states have pursued independent regulation of greenhouse gases at the state level. For example, the California Global Warming Solutions Act, also known as AB 32, directs the CARB to develop and issue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California to 1990 levels by 2020. CARB has issued a variety of regulations aimed at reaching this goal, including a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) as well as a state-wide cap-and-trade program. The LCFS is effective in 2011, with small reductions in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold in California. The mandated reductions in carbon intensity are scheduled to increase through 2020, after which another step-change in reductions is anticipated. The LCFS is designed to encourage substitution of traditional petroleum fuels, and, over time, it is anticipated that the LCFS will lead to a greater use of electric cars and alternative fuels, such as E85, as companies seek to generate more credits to offset petroleum fuels. The state-wide cap-and-trade program will begin in 2012. Initially, the program will apply only to stationary sources of greenhouse gases (e.g., refinery and power plant greenhouse gas emissions). Greenhouse gas emissions from fuels that we sell in California will be covered by the program beginning in 2015. We anticipate that free allocations of credits will be available in the early years of the program, but we expect that compliance costs will be significant, particularly beginning in 2015, when fuels are included in the program. Complying with AB 32, including the LCFS and the cap-and-trade program, could result in material increased compliance costs for us, increased capital expenditures, increased operating costs, and additional operating restrictions for our business, resulting in an increase in the cost of, and decreases in the demand for, the products we produce. To the degree we are unable to recover these increased costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. On June 30, 2010, the EPA formally disapproved the flexible permits program submitted by the TCEQ in 1994 for inclusion in its clean-air implementation plan. The EPA determined that Texas’ flexible permit program did not meet several requirements under the federal Clean Air Act. Our Port Arthur, Texas City, Three Rivers, McKee and Corpus Christi East and West Refineries formerly operated under flexible permits administered by the TCEQ. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we completed the conversion of our flexible permits into federally enforceable conventional state NSR permits (“de-flexed permits”). We are now in the process of incorporating these de-flexed permits into our Title V permits. Continued discussions with EPA regarding this matter are likely. Meanwhile, EPA has formally disapproved other TCEQ permitting programs that historically have streamlined the environmental permitting process in Texas. For example, EPA has disapproved the TCEQ pollution control standard permit, thus requiring conventional permitting for future pollution control equipment. Litigation is pending from industry groups and others against EPA for each of these actions. EPA has also objected to numerous Title V permits in Texas and other states, including permits at our Port Arthur, Corpus Christi East, and McKee Refineries. Environmental activist groups have filed a notice of intent to sue EPA, seeking to require EPA to assume control of these permits from the TCEQ. All of these developments have created substantial uncertainty regarding existing and future permitting. Because of this uncertainty, we are unable to determine the costs or effects of EPA’s actions on our permitting activity. But EPA’s disruption of the Texas permitting system could result in material increased compliance costs for us, increased capital expenditures, increased operating costs, and additional operating restrictions for our business, resulting in an increase in the cost of, and decreases in the demand for, the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Tax MattersAs discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive tax liabilities. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to 48Table of Contentsour tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. Effective June 1, 2010, the GOA enacted a new tax regime applicable to refinery and terminal operations in Aruba. Under the new tax regime, we are subject to a profit tax rate of 7 percent and a dividend withholding tax rate of 0 percent. In addition, all imports and exports are exempt from turnover tax and throughput fees. Beginning June 1, 2012, we will also make a minimum annual tax payment of $10 million (payable in equal quarterly installments) with the ability to carry forward any excess tax prepayments to future tax years. The new tax regime was the result of a settlement agreement that we entered into on February 24, 2010 with the GOA that established the terms for settlement of a lengthy and complicated tax dispute between the parties. On May 30, 2010, the Aruban Parliament adopted several laws that implemented the provisions of the settlement agreement, which became effective June 1, 2010. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, we relinquished the provisions of the previous tax holiday regime. On June 4, 2010, we made a payment to the GOA of $118 million (primarily from restricted cash held in escrow) in consideration of a full release of all tax claims prior to June 1, 2010. Financial Regulatory ReformOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform Act). The Wall Street Reform Act, among many things, creates new regulations for companies that extend credit to consumers and requires most derivative instruments to be traded on exchanges and routed through clearinghouses. Rules to implement the Wall Street Reform Act are being finalized and therefore, the impact to our operations is not yet known. However, implementation could result in higher margin requirements, higher clearing costs, and more reporting requirements with respect to our derivative activities. OtherOur refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 49Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Impairment of AssetsLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and refinery turnaround and catalyst costs, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. In order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment evaluations and certain losses resulting from those evaluations. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES – Environmental Matters,” could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws 50Table of Contentsand regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes. The amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 is included in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit ObligationsWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that each receive one of the two highest ratings given by the recognized rating agencies as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2011 (in millions): Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefitsIncrease in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease$70 $12 Compensation rate increase29 — Health care cost trend rate increase— 5 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease9 1 Expected return on plan assets decrease4 — Compensation rate increase6 — Health care cost trend rate increase— 1 See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. 51Table of ContentsTax MattersOur operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities. Legal MattersA variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our litigation matters. 52Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our refining operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we enter into commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to hedge:• inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year LIFO inventory levels differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels and • forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to commodities that we perceive as opportunities to benefit our results of operations and cash flows, but for which there are no related physical transactions. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): Derivative Instruments Held For Non-Trading Purposes TradingPurposesDecember 31, 2010 Gain (loss) in fair value due to: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices$(199) $— 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices189 (1) December 31, 2009 Gain (loss) in fair value due to: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices(6) (8)10% decrease in underlying commodity prices6 — See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2010. 53Table of ContentsINTEREST RATE RISK The following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.

We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following:•acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined products or receive feedstocks;•political and economic conditions in nations that produce crude oil or consume refined products;•demand for, and supplies of, refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil, petrochemicals, and ethanol;•demand for, and supplies of, crude oil and other feedstocks;24Table of Contents•the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls;•the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations;•refinery overcapacity or undercapacity;•our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations;•the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and adjustments to refining capacity in response to market conditions;•the levels of competitors’ imports into markets that we supply;•accidents, unscheduled shutdowns, or other catastrophes affecting our refineries, machinery, pipelines, equipment, and information systems, or those of our suppliers or customers;•changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined products;•the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles;•the levels of government subsidies for ethanol and other alternative fuels;•delay of, cancellation of, or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects;•earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil, grain and other feedstocks, and refined products and ethanol;•rulings, judgments, or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs, in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage;•legislative or regulatory action, including the introduction or enactment of legislation or rulemakings by governmental authorities, including tax and environmental regulations, such as those to be implemented under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (also known as AB 32) and the EPA’s regulation of greenhouse gases, which may adversely affect our business or operations;•changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and trade credit;•changes in currency exchange rates, including the value of the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling, and the euro relative to the U.S. dollar; •overall economic conditions, including the stability and liquidity of financial markets; and•other factors generally described in the “Risk Factors” section included in Items 1, 1A, and 2, “Business, Risk Factors, and Properties” in this report.Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so.All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.25Table of ContentsOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOKWe reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of $2.1 billion, or $3.69 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $923 million, or $1.62 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2010. The improvement in net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to an increase in operating income of $1.8 billion attributable to the business segments outlined in the following table (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 ChangeOperating income (loss) by business segment: Refining $3,516 $1,903 $1,613Retail 381 346 35Ethanol 396 209 187Corporate (613) (582) (31)Total $3,680 $1,876 $1,804The increase of $1.6 billion in refining operating income was primarily due to the favorable difference between the price of sweet crude oils sourced from the inland U.S., such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), versus the price of benchmark sweet crude oils, such as LLS and Brent. Historically, the price of WTI-type crude oil has closely approximated LLS and Brent crude oils. Due to the significant development of crude oil reserves within the U.S. Mid-Continent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. Mid-Continent region, the increased supply of WTI-type crude oil resulted in WTI-type crude oil being priced at a significant discount to LLS and Brent crude oils for most of 2011 as compared to 2010. Our McKee and Ardmore Refineries in the U.S. Mid-Continent region process WTI-type crude oils and significantly benefited from this favorable price difference.The increase of $35 million in retail operating income was primarily due to higher fuel margins and volumes in our Canadian operations, including a favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.The increase of $187 million in ethanol operating income was primarily due to improved operating margins combined with an increase in production volumes to an average of 3.4 million gallons per day. The ethanol business is dependent on margins between ethanol and corn feedstocks and is impacted by U.S. government subsidies and biofuels (including ethanol) mandates.On August 1, 2011, we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Chevron Limited from a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation and we subsequently changed the name of Chevron Limited to Valero Energy Ltd. Valero Energy Ltd owns and operates the Pembroke Refinery. Valero Energy Ltd also owns, directly and through various subsidiaries, an extensive network of marketing and logistics assets throughout the U.K. and Ireland. On the acquisition date, we initially paid $1.8 billion from available cash, of which $1.1 billion was for working capital. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we recorded an adjustment to working capital (primarily inventory), resulting in an adjusted purchase price of $1.7 billion. This acquisition is referred to as the Pembroke Acquisition.26Table of ContentsOn October 1, 2011, we acquired the Meraux Refinery and related logistics assets from Murphy Oil Corporation for an initial payment of $586 million, which was funded from available cash. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded an adjustment related to inventories acquired that reduced the purchase price to $547 million. The benefit we experienced in our refining business for most of 2011 from processing discounted WTI-type crude oils declined significantly during the fourth quarter of 2011 as the premium of LLS and Brent crude oils versus WTI-type crude oil narrowed considerably. In addition, our fourth quarter 2011 results reflected a significant decline in margins for most of the products we produce. Product margins have since improved in early 2012, but we expect the energy markets and margins to be volatile. The U.S. and worldwide refining business continues to experience capacity rationalization, particularly in Europe, the U.S. East Coast, and the Caribbean, where declining product margins have negatively impacted refineries in those regions. In particular, our Aruba Refinery has been negatively impacted. We restarted the Aruba Refinery in January 2011 after shutting it down temporarily in July 2009, but the refinery has not yet generated positive cash flows on a sustained basis. We are exploring strategic alternatives for the refinery, including alternative feedstocks, configuration changes, and a temporary or permanent shutdown of the refinery facilities. We expect to conclude our evaluation of these strategic alternatives in the first quarter of 2012. A decision to temporarily or permanently shut down the refinery or a revision to the future operating plans for the refinery that results in a decrease in future expected cash flows could result in the refinery being impaired. The Aruba Refinery had a net book value of $958 million as of December 31, 2011; therefore, an impairment loss would be material to our results of operations.As of the date of the filing of this report, the financial markets continue to experience significant volatility and the overall impact on our business is uncertain at this time.27Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market prices that directly impact our operations.

ContentsThe following notes relate to references on pages 28 through 32.(a)The financial highlights and operating highlights for the refining segment and U.S. Gulf Coast region include the results of operations of our Meraux Refinery, including related logistics assets, from the date of its acquisition on October 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. (b)The financial highlights and operating highlights for the refining segment and North Atlantic region include the results of operations of our Pembroke Refinery, including the related market and logistics business from the date of its acquisition on August 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. (c)In 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery and our shutdown Delaware City refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets. The results of operations of these refineries have been presented as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, the operating highlights for the refining segment and North Atlantic region exclude these refineries for the year ended December 31, 2010.(d)We acquired three ethanol plants in the first quarter of 2010. The information presented includes the results of operations of these plants commencing on their respective acquisition dates. Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during each year divided by actual calendar days per year.(e)Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.(f)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.(g)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, St. Charles, Aruba, Port Arthur, and Meraux Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic (formerly known as Northeast) region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.(h)Average market reference prices for LLS crude oil, along with price differentials between the price of LLS crude oil and other types of crude oil, have been included in the table of Average Market Reference Prices and Differentials. The table also includes price differentials by region between the prices of certain products and the benchmark crude oil that provides the best indicator of product margins for each region. Prior to the first quarter of 2011, feedstock and product differentials were based on the price of WTI crude oil. However, the price of WTI crude oil no longer provides a reasonable benchmark price of crude oil for all regions. Beginning in late 2010, WTI crude oil began to price at a discount to benchmark sweet crude oils, such as LLS and Brent, because of increased WTI supplies resulting from greater U.S. production and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. Mid-Continent region. Therefore, the use of the price of WTI crude oil as a benchmark price for regions that do not process WTI crude oil is no longer reasonable.GeneralOperating revenues increased 53 percent (or $43.8 billion) for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices and higher throughput volumes between the two years related to our refining segment operations. The higher throughput volumes resulted primarily from the incremental throughput of 33,000 BPD1 ($1.3 billion of revenue) from the Meraux Refinery, which was acquired on October 1, 2011, incremental throughput of 109,000 BPD1 ($7.5 billion of revenue) from the Pembroke Refinery, which was acquired on August 1, 2011, and incremental throughput of 145,000 BPD ($4.9 billion of revenue) from the Aruba Refinery, which restarted operations in January 2011. Operating income increased $1.8 billion and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to a $1.6 billion increase in refining segment operating income discussed below._______________1Calculated based on throughput volumes of the Meraux Refinery and the Pembroke Refinery from the date of their respective acquisitions (October 1, 2011 and August 1, 2011), divided by the number of days during the year ended December 31, 2011.33Table of ContentsRefiningRefining segment operating income nearly doubled from $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The $1.6 billion improvement in operating income was due to a $2.2 billion increase in refining margin, partially offset by a $462 million increase in operating expenses.The $2.2 billion increase in refining margin was primarily due to a 19 percent increase in throughput margin per barrel (a $1.50 per barrel increase between the years). This increase in refining margin was largely driven by an improvement in the U.S. Mid-Continent region, which experienced an increase in its throughput margin per barrel of $7.77. The U.S. Mid-Continent throughput margin per barrel of $15.10 for the year ended December 31, 2011 was more than double the throughput margin per barrel of $7.33 for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase was due to the substantial discount in the price of WTI-type crude oil, the primary type of crude oil processed by our U.S. Mid-Continent refineries, versus the price of LLS and Brent crude oils. Historically, the price of WTI-type crude oil has closely approximated LLS and Brent crude oils, but due to the significant development of crude oil reserves within the U.S. Mid-Continent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. Mid-Continent region, the increased supply of WTI-type crude oil resulted in WTI-type crude oil being priced at a significant discount to LLS and Brent crude oils during 2011. For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent conventional 87 gasoline was $22.37 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $8.20 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing a favorable increase of $14.17 per barrel. In addition, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low sulfur diesel (a type of distillate) was $31.06 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $11.91 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing a favorable increase of $19.15 per barrel. We estimate that these increases in gasoline and distillate margins per barrel had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, year over year. The increase of $462 million in operating expenses discussed above was partially due to $42 million in operating expenses of the Meraux Refinery, which was acquired on October 1, 2011, and $141 million in operating expenses of the Pembroke Refinery, which was acquired on August 1, 2011. The remaining increase of $279 million was due to a $107 million increase in chemicals and catalyst costs, an $86 million increase in employee-related expenses, and a $75 million increase in reliability expenses.RetailRetail operating income was $381 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $346 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This 10 percent (or $35 million) increase was primarily due to increases in fuel margins of $43 million primarily from our Canadian operations, including a favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, and an increase in merchandise margins of $15 million, offset by increased operating expenses of $24 million.EthanolEthanol segment operating income was $396 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $209 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase of $187 million was primarily due to a $226 million increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $36 million increase in operating expenses.Gross margin increased from the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2011 due to an increase in ethanol production (a 331,000 gallon per day increase between the years) primarily resulting from the full operation of three additional plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010 and higher utilization rates and increased yields during 2011 combined with a $0.13 per gallon increase in the ethanol gross margin.34Table of ContentsThe increase in operating expenses was primarily due to $27 million of additional expenses related to the three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010. We operated these plants for all of 2011 compared to part of 2010.Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses increased $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to a $25 million increase in variable compensation expense, $27 million in costs incurred in connection with the Pembroke Acquisition, and a favorable settlement with an insurance company for $40 million recorded in 2010, which reduced general and administrative expenses in 2010. These increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by favorable legal settlements of $47 million in 2011.“Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $63 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 due to a pre-tax gain of $55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (CHOPS) recognized in November 2010 and the $16 million effect of earnings on our interest in CHOPS recognized in 2010.“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $83 million from the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease is primarily due to an increase of $62 million in capitalized interest related to an increase in capital expenditures between the years and the resumption of construction activity on previously suspended projects combined with a $19 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings.Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $651 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 mainly as a result of higher operating income in 2011 and a one-time $20 million income tax benefit recognized in 2010 related to a tax settlement with the Government of Aruba (GOA).The loss from discontinued operations of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily due to adjustments to the working capital settlement related to the sale of our Paulsboro Refinery in December 2010. The loss from discontinued operations of $599 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 represents a $47 million after-tax loss from the discontinued operations of the Delaware City and Paulsboro Refineries and a $610 million after-tax loss on the sale of the Paulsboro Refinery, partially offset by a $58 million after-tax gain on the sale of the shutdown refinery assets at Delaware City.35Table of Contents2010 Compared to 2009Financial Highlights (a) (b) (c)(millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 ChangeOperating revenues$82,233 $64,599

ContentsThe following notes relate to references on pages 36 through 40.(a)In December 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery to PBF Holding Company LLC for $547 million of cash proceeds and a $160 million one-year note, resulting in a pre-tax loss on the sale of $980 million ($610 million after taxes). The results of operations of the refinery, including the loss on the sale, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and North Atlantic Region operating highlights exclude the Paulsboro Refinery for both years presented.(b)During the fourth quarter of 2009, we permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery and wrote down the book value of the refinery assets to net realizable value, resulting in a pre-tax loss on the shutdown of $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after taxes). In June 2010, we sold the shutdown refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets to wholly owned subsidiaries of PBF Energy Partners LP for $220 million of cash proceeds, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of the refinery assets of $92 million ($58 million after taxes) and an insignificant gain on the sale of the terminal and pipeline assets. The results of operations of the shutdown refinery, including the gain on the sale in 2010 and the loss on the shutdown in 2009, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and North Atlantic Region operating highlights exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years presented. The terminal and pipeline assets associated with the refinery were not shut down in 2009 and continued to be operated until they were sold; the results of these operations are reflected in continuing operations for both years presented.(c)We acquired three ethanol plants in the first quarter of 2010 and seven ethanol plants in the second quarter of 2009. The information presented includes the results of operations of these plants commencing on their respective acquisition dates. Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during each year divided by actual calendar days per year. (d)The asset impairment loss relates primarily to the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects classified as “construction in progress” as a result of the unfavorable impact of the economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel.(e)Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.(f)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.(g)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Quebec City Refinery; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.(h)A loss contingency accrual of $140 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute with the GOA regarding a turnover tax on export sales as well as other tax matters. The portion of the loss contingency accrual that relates to the turnover tax was recorded in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, and therefore is included in refining operating income (loss) but has been excluded in determining throughput margin per barrel.GeneralOperating revenues increased 27 percent (or $17.6 billion) for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices between the two years. Operating income increased $1.8 billion and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to a $1.7 billion increase in refining segment operating income discussed below.RefiningOperating income for our refining segment increased from $247 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to an overall improvement in operating results of $1.3 billion (discussed below), reduced asset impairment loss of $218 million, and the nonrecurrence of a $114 million loss contingency accrual in 2009. The asset impairment loss recorded in 2009 related to our decision to permanently cancel certain construction projects in response to the economic slowdown that began in 2008. We continued to evaluate our ongoing construction projects during 2009 and 2010, but the number and significance of projects cancelled substantially declined in 2010. The loss contingency accrual recorded in 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in Aruba.41Table of ContentsThe $1.3 billion improvement in operating results was primarily due to a 30 percent increase in throughput margin per barrel (an overall $1.80 per barrel increase between the comparable years). The increase in throughput margin per barrel was caused by a significant improvement in distillate margins and petrochemical (primarily propylene) margins, but these improvements were somewhat offset by a decline in gasoline margins in two of our refining regions. Throughput margin per barrel also benefited from wider sour crude oil differentials. The impact of these factors on our throughput margin per barrel is described below.•Changes in the margin we receive for our products have a material impact on our results of operations. For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel was $11.14 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $8.02 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a favorable increase of $3.12 per barrel. Similar increases in distillate margins were experienced in other regions. We estimate that the increase in margin for distillates had an $820 million positive impact on our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced 712,000 BPD of distillates during the year ended December 31, 2010. Similarly, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast propylene was $7.92 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a negative margin of $1.31 for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a favorable increase of $9.23 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in margin for petrochemicals (primarily propylene) had a $199 million positive impact on our refining margin, year over year. Distillate and propylene margins were higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to an increase in the industrial demand for these products resulting from the ongoing recovery of the U.S. and worldwide economies and exports. •The WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast conventional 87 gasoline was $7.51 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $7.61 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing an unfavorable decrease of $0.10 per barrel. The WTI-based CARBOB 87 gasoline benchmark reference margins decreased year over year to an even greater extent in the U.S. West Coast region (a $1.87 per barrel unfavorable decrease). We estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins had a $119 million negative impact to our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced 1.05 million BPD of gasoline during the year ended December 31, 2010. Gasoline margins were lower in 2010 as compared to 2009 despite an increase in gasoline prices during 2010. We believe that the margins for gasoline were constrained due to continued weak consumer demand and high levels of inventory. In addition, our downstream customers increased the use of ethanol as a component in transportation fuels because its price was lower than the price of gasoline.•For the year ended December 31, 2010, the differential applicable to the price of sour crude oil as compared to the price of sweet crude oil was wider than the differential for the year ended December 31, 2009. For example, Maya crude oil, which is a type of sour crude oil, sold at a discount of $9.13 per barrel to WTI crude oil, a type of sweet crude oil, during the year ended December 31, 2010. This compared to a discount of $5.19 per barrel during the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a favorable increase of $3.94 per barrel. The benefit of this wider differential, however, was offset by a reduction of 30,000 BPD of sour crude oil that we processed during 2010 as compared to 2009. We estimate that the wider differentials for all types of sour crude oil that we process, offset by reduced throughput volumes, had a $196 million positive impact to our overall refining margin for 2010 as we processed 844,000 BPD of sour crude oils.42Table of ContentsRetailRetail operating income was $346 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This 18 percent (or $53 million) increase was primarily due to increases in retail fuel margins of $57 million and merchandise margin of $27 million, partially offset by a $28 million increase in operating expenses.Retail fuel margins are affected by the blending of ethanol with the gasoline sold by our retail segment. For most of 2010, ethanol was a lower cost product than gasoline and this lower cost resulted in an increase in retail fuel margins. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) price for a gallon of ethanol was $0.23 less than a gallon of U.S. Gulf Coast conventional 87 gasoline for the year ended December 31, 2010, but there was little difference between the prices of these products for the year ended December 31, 2009. We estimate that the lower cost of ethanol had a $32 million positive impact to our U.S. retail fuel margins for 2010 as approximately 80 percent of the gasoline we sold during the year ended December 31, 2010 contained 10 percent ethanol. Retail fuel margins in our Canadian retail operations increased by $27 million due to the favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. On average, Cdn$1 was equal to $0.96 during 2010 compared to $0.88 in 2009, representing an increase in value of nine percent.Retail merchandise margins increased due to increased product pricing combined with improved product mix, and a favorable impact from the stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009, as described above.The increase in operating expenses was also due to the stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. The stronger Canadian dollar had a $21 million unfavorable impact on the 2010 operating expenses of our Canadian retail operations compared to 2009. EthanolEthanol operating income was $209 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase of $44 million was primarily due to a full year of operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the second quarter of 2009 and the addition of three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to a favorable settlement with an insurance company for $40 million recorded in 2010, which offset an increase in litigation costs of $40 million recorded in 2009. After adjusting for these items, the $40 million increase in general and administrative expenses year over year resulted from an increase of $21 million for incentive compensation expenses and an increase of $18 million for environmental remediation expenses. “Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $89 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 due to a pre-tax gain of $55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in CHOPS in November 2010 and the effect of a $42 million loss in 2009 on changes in the fair values of an earn-out agreement and associated derivative instruments that were entered into in connection with the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery in 2008.“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” increased $68 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase is composed of a $53 million increase 43Table of Contentsin interest incurred on $1.25 billion of debt issued in February 2010 and $1.0 billion of debt issued in March 2009 (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and a $15 million decrease in capitalized interest due to a reduction in capital expenditures between the years and the temporary suspension of activity on certain construction projects. We do not capitalize interest with respect to suspended construction projects until significant construction activities resume. Income tax expense increased $618 million from a $43 million benefit in 2009 to $575 million of expense in 2010 mainly as a result of higher operating income in 2010.“Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” decreased $1.1 billion from the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to the after-tax loss of $1.2 billion related to the permanent shut down of our Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009. The results of operations for the Paulsboro and Delaware City Refineries, including the loss and gain, respectively, on their sales, are reflected in “Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” as discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2011Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $4.0 billion compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the $1.8 billion increase in operating income discussed above under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.” Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2011 due to significant increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of 2011 compared to such prices at the end of 2010.The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2011 combined with $150 million of proceeds from the sale of receivables and $2.3 billion from available cash on hand was used mainly to:•fund $3.0 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; •purchase the Pembroke Refinery and the related marketing and logistics business for $1.7 billion;•purchase the Meraux Refinery for $547 million;•redeem our Series 1997B 5.4% and Series 1997C 5.4% industrial revenue bonds for $56 million;•make scheduled long-term note repayments of $418 million;•acquire the Gulf Opportunity Zone Revenue Bonds Series 2010 (GO Zone Bonds) for $300 million;•purchase our common stock for $349 million; and•pay common stock dividends of $169 million.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2010Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3.0 billion compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the receipt of a $923 million tax refund in 2010. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2010 due to significant increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of 2010 compared to such prices at the end of 2009.44Table of ContentsThe net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2010, combined with $1.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 4.5% notes due in February 2015, $850 million of 6.125% notes due in February 2020, and $300 million of GO Zone Bonds as discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $547 million of proceeds from the sale of the Paulsboro Refinery, $220 million of proceeds from the sale of the shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets, and $330 million of proceeds from the sale of our 50 percent interest in CHOPS as discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, were used mainly to:•fund $2.3 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; •redeem our 7.5% senior notes for $294 million and our 6.75% senior notes for $190 million;•make scheduled long-term note repayments of $33 million;•make net repayments under our accounts receivable sales facility of $100 million;•pay common stock dividends of $114 million;•purchase additional ethanol facilities for $260 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $2.5 billion.Cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Paulsboro and Delaware City Refineries have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009Cash provided by (used in)operating activities: Paulsboro Refinery$— $88 $10Delaware City Refinery— (26) (126)Cash used in investing activities: Paulsboro Refinery— (41) (121)Delaware City Refinery— — (153)Capital InvestmentsOur operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are continuously improved. Improvements consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, and the cost of these improvements is significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process higher volumes of sour crude oil, which lowers our feedstock costs, and enables us to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity 45Table of Contentssignificantly.During the year ended December 31, 2011, we expended $2.4 billion for capital expenditures and $629 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $241 million of costs related to environmental projects.For 2012, we expect to incur approximately $3.4 billion for capital investments, including approximately $2.8 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $140 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $560 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to future strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 are summarized below (in millions).

We amended our agreement in June 2011 to extend the maturity date to June 2012. As of December 31, 2011, the amount of eligible receivables sold was $250 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold $150 million of eligible receivables under this program and made no repayments. All amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt.46Table of ContentsOur agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of December 31, 2011, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows:Rating Agency RatingStandard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook)Moody’s Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook)Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook)We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.Operating Lease ObligationsOur operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks, refined products, and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2011, our short- and long-term purchase obligations increased by approximately $6 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010.Other Long-term LiabilitiesOur other long-term liabilities are described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2011.47Table of ContentsOther Commercial CommitmentsAs of December 31, 2011, our committed lines of credit were as follows (in millions): BorrowingCapacity Expiration OutstandingLetters of CreditLetter of credit facilities $500 June 2012 $300U.S. revolving credit facility $3,000 December 2016 $119Canadian revolving credit facility C$115 December 2012 C$20As of December 31, 2011, we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities. The letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2011 expire during 2012 and 2013.Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Purchase ProgramsAs of December 31, 2011, we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately $3.5 billion of our common stock.Pension Plan Funded StatusDuring 2011, we contributed $204 million to our pension plans that have minimum funding requirements. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of the assets of these plans was approximately 88 percent of the projected benefit obligations under these plans.We have minimum required contributions of $2 million to these pension plans during 2012; however, we plan to contribute approximately $100 million to our pension plans during 2012.Environmental Matters Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters. Tax MattersWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, transactional taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. See Notes 12 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax matters. 48Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal tax returns from 2002 through 2009, as discussed in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have received Revenue Agent Reports on our tax years for 2002 through 2007 and we are vigorously contesting many of the tax positions and assertions from the IRS. Although we believe our tax liabilities are fairly stated and properly reflected in our financial statements, should the IRS eventually prevail, it could result in a material amount of our deferred tax liabilities being reclassified to current liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.Cash Held by Our International SubsidiariesWe operate in countries outside the U.S. through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries, and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the U.S. in the form of cash dividends. Should we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated. In addition, such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations, as further discussed in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe, however, that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the U.S. without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings. As of December 31, 2011, $822 million of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries.Financial Regulatory ReformIn July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform Act). The Wall Street Reform Act, among many things, creates new regulations for companies that extend credit to consumers and requires most derivative instruments to be traded on exchanges and routed through clearinghouses. Rules to implement the Wall Street Reform Act are being finalized and therefore, the impact to our operations is not yet known. However, implementation could result in higher margin requirements, higher clearing costs, and more reporting requirements with respect to our derivative activities.Concentration of CustomersOur refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.Sources of LiquidityWe believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.49Table of ContentsNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAs discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our financial statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable.Property, Plant and EquipmentThe cost of property, plant and equipment (property assets) purchased or constructed, including betterments of property assets, are capitalized. The cost of repairs to and normal maintenance of property assets, however, is expensed as incurred. Betterments of property assets are those which either extend the useful life, increase the capacity or improve the operating efficiency of the asset, or improve the safety of our operations. The cost of property assets constructed includes interest and certain overhead costs allocable to the construction activities.Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are continuously improved. Improvements consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.Depreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation. We maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries. We estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group, and such evaluations consist of, but are not limited to, the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition, consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained, assessment of the need to replace assets, and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group. The estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years.Under the composite method of depreciation, the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life. We design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications, design standards and practices accepted in our industry, and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives. Therefore, we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group. It should be noted, however, that factors such as competition, regulation, or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting depreciation expense in the future.50Table of ContentsAlso under the composite method of depreciation, the historical cost of a minor property asset (net of salvage value) that is retired or replaced is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in income. However, a gain or loss is recognized in income for a major property asset that is retired, replaced or sold and for an abnormal disposition of a property asset (primarily involuntary conversions). Gains and losses are reflected in depreciation and amortization expense, unless such amounts are reported separately due to materiality.Impairment of AssetsLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and refinery turnaround and catalyst costs, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. In order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from those analyses.We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes.51Table of ContentsThe amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 is included in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit ObligationsWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements. For example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2012 (in millions): Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefitsIncrease in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease$85 $13Compensation rate increase33 —Health care cost trend rate increase— 5 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease14 1Expected return on plan assets decrease4 —Compensation rate increase8 —Health care cost trend rate increase— 1See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.Tax MattersWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, transactional taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts.We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our 52Table of Contentsestimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. See Notes 12 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities.Legal MattersA variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.53Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to hedge:•inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels and •forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of these forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows.Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): Derivative Instruments Held For Non-Trading Purposes TradingPurposesDecember 31, 2011 Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices$(156) $110% decrease in underlying commodity prices156 2 December 31, 2010 Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices(199) —10% decrease in underlying commodity prices189 (1)See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2011.54Table of ContentsCOMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of financial instruments associated withvarious governmental and regulatory compliance programs that we must purchase in the open market to comply with these programs. To reduce the impact of this risk on our results of operations and cash flows, we may enter into derivative instruments, such as futures. As of December 31, 2011, there was no significant gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the futures contracts. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs and notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2011. INTEREST RATE RISKThe following table provides information about our debt instruments, excluding capital lease obligations (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.

Included in our 2012 results, however, were noncash asset impairment losses totaling $983 million after taxes, or $1.77 per share (assuming dilution), primarily related to the impairment of the refining assets of our Aruba Refinery in connection with our decision in September 2012 to reorganize the refinery into a crude oil and refined products terminal. This matter is more fully discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operating income increased $330 million from 2011 to 2012 as outlined by business segment in the following table (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 ChangeOperating income (loss) by business segment: Refining $4,450 $3,516 $934Retail 348 381 (33)Ethanol (47) 396 (443)Corporate (741) (613) (128)Total $4,010 $3,680 $330Operating income for 2012 was also negatively impacted by the noncash asset impairment losses discussed above, as well as severance expense of $41 million related to the operations at our Aruba Refinery, and operating income for 2011 was impacted by a $542 million loss on commodity derivative contracts related to forward sales of refined product. Excluding these significant items, total operating income for 2012 and 2011 would have been $5.1 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, reflecting a $900 million favorable increase between the years, and refining segment operating income for 2012 and 2011 would have been $5.5 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, reflecting a favorable increase of $1.4 billion between the years.The $1.4 billion increase in refining segment operating income was primarily the result of improvements in the margin generated by our U.S. Mid-Continent and North Atlantic refining operations, which experienced increases in throughput margin of $2.58 per barrel and $3.81 per barrel, respectively, in 2012 compared to 2011. Our U.S. Mid-Continent region continued to benefit from the favorable difference between the price of Brent crude oil and WTI-type crude oil, which is the type of crude oil primarily processed by our refineries in this region. Because the market for refined products generally tracks the price of Brent crude oil, we benefit when the price of WTI-type crude oil is lower than the price of Brent crude oil. The favorable difference between the price of WTI and Brent crude oil improved by $1.67 per barrel in 2012 compared to 2011, which contributed significantly to the increase in the throughput margin generated by our operations in this region. The results of our North Atlantic region were favorably impacted by increases in refined product prices due largely to a reduction in the supply of refined products in this region as compared to the prior year. This reduction in supply resulted from the continued shutdown of refineries in the U.S. East Coast, Caribbean, and Western Europe during 2012, which was due to poor refining economics in these areas, and supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Sandy, which struck the U.S. East Coast in October 2012.The favorable results of our refining segment were partially offset by the $443 million decrease in our ethanol segment’s operating income in 2012 compared to 2011. This decrease was due to significantly lower gross 28Table of Contentsmargins in 2012 caused by a combination of high corn prices and an oversupply of ethanol in the market. The increase in corn prices in 2012 was largely due to the severe drought experienced in grain producing regions of the U.S. in 2012, and the oversupply of ethanol inventories was largely attributable to lower exports of ethanol to Europe and increased imports of ethanol from Brazil.OutlookThroughout 2011 and 2012, our refining business benefited from processing sweet crude oils sourced from the inland U.S., such as WTI crude oil, due to the favorable difference between the price of this type of crude oil and the price of a benchmark sweet crude oil, such as Brent crude oil. Historically, the price of WTI-type crude oil has closely approximated Brent crude oil, but due to the significant development of crude oil reserves within the U.S. Mid-Continent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. Mid-Continent region, the increased supply of WTI crude oil has resulted in WTI crude oil being priced at a significant discount to Brent crude oil. This benefit, however, may decline as various crude oil pipeline and logistics projects are completed. These projects will allow cost-advantaged crude oils from the inland U.S. and Canada to be transported to the U.S. Gulf Coast region, which is expected to result in a narrowing of the price differential of WTI-priced crude oils relative to Brent-priced crude oils. As a result, the margins for refined products for refiners that process WTI-priced crude oils may decline.Continued refinery closures in the U.S. East Coast, Caribbean, and Western Europe and additional closures expected to occur in the industry combined with poor reliability and low utilization in Latin American refineries create opportunities for competitive refineries to export quality products at higher margins. However, some marginally profitable refineries may continue to be operated, which could negatively impact refined product margins.Thus far in the first quarter of 2013, ethanol margins have improved, but the improvement is not significant and the margins remain far below those experienced in 2011. We expect a continued modest improvement in ethanol margins throughout 2013 relative to those in 2012.Energy markets and margins are volatile, and we expect them to continue to be volatile in the near to mid-term.We continue to make progress in the separation of our retail business under a new company named CST Brands, Inc. The separation is planned by way of a pro rata distribution of 80 percent of the outstanding shares of CST common stock to Valero stockholders. The distribution is expected to take place in the second quarter of 2013, assuming a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS and clearance of all comments from the SEC relating to CST’s registration statement on Form 10. When the distribution occurs, we expect to receive approximately $1.1 billion of cash and incur a tax liability of approximately $230 million. We also expect to liquidate the remaining 20 percent of CST outstanding shares within 18 months of the distribution. Details of the separation and distribution are provided in filings with the SEC by CST.29Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market prices that directly impact our operations.

segment and U.S. Gulf Coast region reflect the results of operations of our Meraux Refinery, including related logistics assets, from the date of its acquisition on October 1, 2011.(b)The financial highlights and operating highlights for the refining segment and North Atlantic region reflect the results of operations of our Pembroke Refinery, including the related market and logistics business, from the date of its acquisition on August 1, 2011.(c)Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes a loss of $542 million ($352 million after taxes) on commodity derivative contracts related to the forward sales of refined product. These contracts were closed and realized during the first quarter of 2011. This loss is reflected in refining segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, but throughput margin per barrel for the refining segment has been restated from the amount previously presented to exclude this $542 million loss ($0.61 per barrel). In addition, operating income and throughput margin per barrel for the U.S. Gulf Coast, the U.S. Mid-Continent, and the U.S. West Coast regions for the year ended December 31, 2011 have been restated from the amounts previously presented to exclude the portion of this loss that had been allocated to them of $372 million ($0.70 per barrel), $122 million ($0.81 per barrel), and $48 million ($0.51 per barrel), respectively.(d)In September 2012, we decided to reorganize our Aruba Refinery into a crude oil and refined products terminal. These terminal operations require a considerably smaller workforce; therefore, the reorganization resulted in the termination of the majority of our employees in Aruba. We recognized severance expense of $41 million in September 2012. This expense is reflected in refining segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, but it is excluded from operating costs per barrel for the refining segment and the U.S. Gulf Coast region. No income tax benefits were recognized related to this severance expense.(e)During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized the following asset impairment losses (in millions):Refining segment: Aruba Refinery $928Cancelled capital projects 65Asset impairment losses - refining segment 993Retail segment: U.S. stores 12Canada stores 9Asset impairment losses - retail segment 21Total asset impairment losses $1,014The asset impairment loss related to the Aruba Refinery resulted from our decision in March 2012 to suspend refining operations at the refinery and our subsequent decision in September 2012 to reorganize the refinery into a crude oil and refined products terminal, as discussed in note (d). We recognized an asset impairment loss of $595 million in March 2012 and an additional asset impairment loss of $308 million in September 2012, resulting in no remaining book value being associated with the refinery’s idled processing units and related infrastructure (refining assets). In addition, we recorded a loss of $25 million related to supplies inventories that supported the refining operations. The refining operations will remain suspended indefinitely; however, we continue to maintain the refining assets to allow them to be restarted and do not consider them to be abandoned. No income tax benefits were recorded related to this asset impairment loss.We also recognized asset impairment losses related to permanently cancelled capital projects at certain of our refineries and related to our determination that the net book values of certain of our retail stores were not recoverable through the future operation and disposition of those stores. The after-tax amount of these asset impairment losses was $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.The asset impairment losses reflected in the table above are included in the operating income of the respective segment for the year ended December 31, 2012. However, the asset impairment losses related to the refining segment are excluded from the segment’s operating costs per barrel and from the operating income and operating costs per barrel by region.(f)Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.(g)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.(h)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, St. Charles, Aruba, Port Arthur, and Meraux Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.35Table of ContentsGeneralOperating revenues increased 11 percent (or $13.3 billion) for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices for most of the products we produce and higher throughput volumes between the two years related to our refining segment operations. Refined product prices are most significantly influenced by the price of crude oil, which is a worldwide commodity whose price is influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to, worldwide supply and demand characteristics, worldwide political conditions, and worldwide economic conditions. However, regional factors also impact the price of refined product prices in those geographic regions. Regional factors can be similar to those that affect the worldwide price of crude oil, but they can also be significantly influenced by weather conditions that disrupt the supply of and demand for refined products in the region. For example, in October 2012, Hurricane Sandy struck the U.S. East Coast and disrupted the supply of refined products in that region for some time, which contributed to the increase of $5.99 per barrel in the North Atlantic benchmark reference price of conventional 87 gasoline in 2012 compared to 2011. The higher throughput volumes in 2012 resulted primarily from the incremental throughput of 75,000 BPD from the Meraux Refinery, which was acquired on October 1, 2011, and incremental throughput of 95,000 BPD from the Pembroke Refinery, which was acquired on August 1, 2011.Operating income increased $330 million and income from continuing operations before income tax expense increased $384 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2011 due to a $934 million increase in refining segment operating income, a $33 million decrease in retail segment operating income, a $443 million decrease in ethanol segment operating income, and a $128 million increase in corporate expenses. The reasons for these changes are described below.RefiningRefining segment operating income increased from $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 to $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was impacted by asset impairment losses of $928 million related to the Aruba Refinery and $65 million related to cancelled capital projects in 2012, $41 million of severance expense related to the Aruba Refinery, and a $542 million loss on derivative contracts in 2011. (See Notes 4 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of the asset impairment losses and the severance expense, respectively). Excluding these amounts, our refining segment operating income increased $1.4 billion from $4.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 to $5.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. This $1.4 billion improvement in operating income was primarily due to a $1.7 billion increase in refining margin, partially offset by a $262 million increase in operating expenses.The $1.7 billion increase in refining margin (a $1.05 per barrel, or 11 percent, increase between 2012 and 2011) was primarily the result of improvements in the margin generated in our U.S. Mid-Continent and North Atlantic regions, which experienced increases in refining margin of $526 million (a $2.58 per barrel increase), and $821 million (a $3.81 per barrel increase), respectively.The $526 million increase in refining margin in the U.S. Mid-Continent region was largely due to improved gasoline and distillate margins in that region in 2012 compared to 2011. For example, the U.S. Mid-Continent benchmark reference margins for conventional 87 gasoline and ultra-low-sulfur diesel, a type of distillate, increased year over year by $3.03 per barrel and $3.90 per barrel, respectively, and these increases were primarily the result of a $1.67 per barrel increase in the discount between the price of WTI crude oil versus Brent crude oil. Brent crude oil is the type of crude oil used by the market to set the price of refined products, but our refineries in the U.S. Mid-Continent region primarily process WTI-type crude oil; therefore, the increase in the price discount between WTI crude oil versus Brent crude oil had a positive impact to our refining margin in this region of approximately $300 million. WTI crude oil priced at a significant discount 36Table of Contentsto Brent crude oil during 2012 because of increases in crude oil reserves within the U.S. Mid-Continent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into that region, coupled with the inability to transport significant quantities of that crude oil to refineries in other regions of the country. As discussed in “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK.” we believe these conditions to remain in the near term; however, we believe the discount will begin to narrow as crude oil pipeline and logistics projects are completed and other forms of transportation are obtained, such as rail cars, to enable significant quantities of WTI-type crude oil to be transported to other regions.The $821 million increase in refining margin in the North Atlantic region was also due to improved gasoline and distillate margins in that region in 2012 compared to 2011. For example, the North Atlantic benchmark reference margins for conventional 87 gasoline and ultra-low-sulfur diesel increased year over year by $5.22 per barrel and $3.42 per barrel, respectively, and these increases were due largely to a reduction in the supply of refined products, which resulted from the continued shutdown of refineries in the U.S. East Coast, Caribbean, and Western Europe during 2012, and supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Sandy, which struck the U.S. East Coast in October 2012.The increase of $262 million in operating expenses discussed above was primarily due to an increase of $123 million in operating expenses of the Meraux Refinery, an increase of $214 million in operating expenses incurred by the Pembroke Refinery, and a decrease of $123 million in operating expenses incurred by the Aruba Refinery. We acquired the Pembroke Refinery on August 1, 2011 and the Meraux Refinery on October 1, 2011; therefore, operating expenses for 2011 only reflected five months of operating expenses of the Pembroke Refinery and three months of operating expenses of the Meraux Refinery. In addition, in March 2012, we suspended the operations of the Aruba Refinery, which resulted in a significant decrease in operating expenses related to that refinery in 2012. The remaining increase in operating expenses of $48 million was primarily due to an increase of $31 million in employee-related expenses due to higher compensation expense related to merit increases and promotions and higher expenses for employee benefit costs, an increase of $9 million in catalyst and chemical costs due to higher prices of rare earth metals used in our fluid catalytic cracking units, an increase of $61 million in ad valorem taxes and insurance expense due to increased insurance reserves in 2012 combined with a nonrecurring favorable ad valorem tax adjustment in 2011, and a decrease of $63 million in energy costs due to lower natural gas prices. Even though operating expenses increased year over year, operating expenses per barrel in 2012 were comparable to 2011 due to the incremental throughput of 179,000 BPD, which primarily resulted from the incremental throughput of the Pembroke and Meraux Refineries discussed above.RetailRetail operating income was $348 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $381 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This 9 percent (or $33 million) decrease was primarily due to a $21 million noncash asset impairment loss related to certain convenience stores (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), a $56 million decrease in fuel margin from our Canadian retail operations, and a $41 million increase in fuel margin in our U.S. retail operations. The Canadian retail fuel margin for 2012 was impacted by a decline in fuel volumes sold as a result of fewer retail sites combined with a decline in the fuel margin per gallon, which was due to pricing pressure from our competitors and changes in wholesale motor fuel prices during the year. Our U.S. retail fuel margin improved during 2012 due to increased fuel volumes sold as a result of more retail sites combined with improved fuel margin per gallon as wholesale motor fuel prices peaked in March 2012 and declined throughout the remainder of the year.37Table of ContentsEthanolEthanol segment operating loss was $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to operating income of $396 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease of $443 million was primarily due to a $507 million decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a $67 million decrease in operating expenses.The decrease in gross margin was due to a 56 percent decrease in the gross margin per gallon of ethanol production (a $0.38 per gallon decrease between the comparable periods) primarily due to lower ethanol prices in 2012 versus 2011. Ethanol prices during 2012 were pressured by a surplus of ethanol supply due to reduced demand for ethanol associated with the decline in gasoline demand in the U.S., lower exports of ethanol to Europe, and increased imports of ethanol from Brazil. In addition, ethanol production decreased 385,000 gallons per day between the comparable periods due to lower utilization rates at our ethanol plants during 2012. The reduction in operating expenses was due primarily to a $57 million decrease in energy costs resulting from decreased consumption because of the lower utilization rates previously discussed, combined with lower natural gas prices versus the comparable period of 2011.Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses increased $127 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 due to $58 million in administrative costs related to our European operations, which we acquired on August 1, 2011, a $23 million increase in employee benefits expense (primarily related to increased costs for medical and retirement benefits), and favorable legal settlements of $47 million in 2011, which did not recur in 2012.“Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $34 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 due to an increase of $15 million of foreign currency transaction losses, an $11 million reduction in interest income due to the collection of a note receivable from PBF Holdings LLC in February 2012, and a $7 million reduction in bank interest income due to lower levels of temporary cash investments during 2012 as compared to the prior year.“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $88 million from the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease is primarily due to an increase of $69 million in capitalized interest related to an increase in capital expenditures between the years and a $33 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings, partially offset by a $12 million write-off of unamortized debt discounts related to the early redemption of certain industrial revenue bonds in the first quarter of 2012.Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased $400 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 partially as a result of higher operating income in 2012. The variation in the customary relationship between income tax expense and income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily due to not recognizing the tax benefits associated with the asset impairment loss of $928 million and the severance expense of $41 million related to the Aruba Refinery as we do not expect to realize a tax benefit from these losses.38Table of Contents2011 Compared to 2010Financial Highlights (a) (b) (d) (e)(millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 ChangeOperating

of $542 million ($352 million after taxes) on commodity derivative contracts related to the forward sales of refined product. These contracts were closed and realized during the first quarter of 2011. This loss is reflected in refining segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, but throughput margin per barrel for the refining segment has been restated from the amount previously presented to exclude this $542 million loss ($0.61 per barrel). In addition, operating income and throughput margin per barrel for the U.S. Gulf Coast, the U.S. Mid-Continent, and the U.S. West Coast regions for the year ended December 31, 2011 have been restated from the amounts previously presented to exclude the portion of this loss that had been allocated to them of $372 million ($0.70 per barrel), $122 million ($0.81 per barrel), and $48 million ($0.51 per barrel), respectively.(d)In 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery and our shutdown Delaware City refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets. The results of operations of these refineries have been presented as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, the operating highlights for the refining segment and North Atlantic region exclude these refineries for the year ended December 31, 2010.(e)We acquired three ethanol plants in the first quarter of 2010. The information presented reflects the results of operations of these plants commencing on their respective acquisition dates. Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during each year divided by actual calendar days per year.(f)Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.(g)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.(h)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, St. Charles, Aruba, Port Arthur, and Meraux Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.(i)Average market reference prices for LLS crude oil, along with price differentials between the price of LLS crude oil and other types of crude oil, have been included in the table of Average Market Reference Prices and Differentials. The table also includes price differentials by region between the prices of certain products and the benchmark crude oil that provides the best indicator of product margins for each region. Prior to the first quarter of 2011, feedstock and product differentials were based on the price of WTI crude oil. However, the price of WTI crude oil no longer provides a reasonable benchmark price of crude oil for all regions. Beginning in late 2010, WTI crude oil began to price at a discount to benchmark sweet crude oils, such as LLS and Brent, because of increased WTI supplies resulting from greater U.S. production and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. Mid-Continent region. Therefore, the use of the price of WTI crude oil as a benchmark price for regions that do not process WTI crude oil is no longer reasonable.GeneralOperating revenues increased 53 percent (or $43.8 billion) for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices and higher throughput volumes between the two years related to our refining segment operations. The higher throughput volumes resulted primarily from the incremental throughput of 33,000 BPD1 ($1.3 billion of revenue) from the Meraux Refinery, which was acquired on October 1, 2011, incremental throughput of 109,000 BPD1 ($7.5 billion of revenue) from the Pembroke Refinery, which was acquired on August 1, 2011, and incremental throughput of 145,000 BPD ($4.9 billion of revenue) from the Aruba Refinery, which restarted operations in January 2011. Operating income increased $1.8 billion and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to a $1.6 billion increase in refining segment operating income discussed below._______________1Calculated based on throughput volumes of the Meraux Refinery and the Pembroke Refinery from the date of their respective acquisitions (October 1, 2011 and August 1, 2011), divided by the number of days during the year ended December 31, 2011.44Table of ContentsRefiningRefining segment operating income nearly doubled from $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The $1.6 billion improvement in operating income was due to a $2.2 billion increase in refining margin, partially offset by a $462 million increase in operating expenses.The $2.2 billion increase in refining margin was primarily due to a 27 percent increase in throughput margin per barrel (a $2.11 per barrel increase between the years). This increase in refining margin was largely driven by an improvement in the U.S. Mid-Continent region, which experienced an increase in its throughput margin per barrel of $8.58. The U.S. Mid-Continent throughput margin per barrel of $15.91 for the year ended December 31, 2011 was more than double the throughput margin per barrel of $7.33 for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase was due to the substantial discount in the price of WTI-type crude oil, the primary type of crude oil processed by our U.S. Mid-Continent refineries, versus the price of LLS and Brent crude oils. Historically, the price of WTI-type crude oil has closely approximated LLS and Brent crude oils, but due to the significant development of crude oil reserves within the U.S. Mid-Continent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. Mid-Continent region, the increased supply of WTI-type crude oil resulted in WTI-type crude oil being priced at a significant discount to LLS and Brent crude oils during 2011. For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent conventional 87 gasoline was $22.37 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $8.20 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing a favorable increase of $14.17 per barrel. In addition, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low sulfur diesel (a type of distillate) was $31.06 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $11.91 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing a favorable increase of $19.15 per barrel. We estimate that these increases in gasoline and distillate margins per barrel had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, year over year. The increase of $462 million in operating expenses discussed above was partially due to $42 million in operating expenses of the Meraux Refinery, which was acquired on October 1, 2011, and $141 million in operating expenses of the Pembroke Refinery, which was acquired on August 1, 2011. The remaining increase of $279 million was due to a $107 million increase in chemicals and catalyst costs due to higher prices of rare earth metals used in our fluid catalytic cracking units, an $86 million increase in employee-related expenses due to higher incentive compensation, and a $75 million increase in reliability expenses due to the re-start of the Aruba Refinery and higher routine maintenance during refinery downtime.RetailRetail operating income was $381 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $346 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This 10 percent (or $35 million) increase was primarily due to increases in fuel margins of $43 million primarily from our Canadian operations, including a favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, and an increase in merchandise margins of $15 million, offset by increased operating expenses of $24 million. The increase in operating expenses was primarily from our Canadian operations which were impacted by the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On average, Cdn$1 was equal to $1.01 during 2011 compared to $0.96 during 2010, representing an increase in value of five percent.EthanolEthanol segment operating income was $396 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $209 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase of $187 million was primarily due to a $226 million increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $36 million increase in operating expenses.45Table of ContentsGross margin increased from the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2011 due to an increase in ethanol production (a 331,000 gallon per day increase between the years) primarily resulting from the full operation of three additional plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010 and higher utilization rates and increased yields during 2011 combined with a $0.13 per gallon increase in the ethanol gross margin.The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to $27 million of additional expenses related to the three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010. We operated these plants for all of 2011 compared to part of 2010.Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses increased $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to a $25 million increase in variable compensation expense, $27 million in costs incurred in connection with the Pembroke Acquisition, and a favorable settlement with an insurance company for $40 million recorded in 2010, which reduced general and administrative expenses in 2010. These increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by favorable legal settlements of $47 million in 2011.“Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $63 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 due to a pre-tax gain of $55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (CHOPS) recognized in November 2010 and the $16 million effect of earnings on our interest in CHOPS recognized in 2010.“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $83 million from the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease is primarily due to an increase of $62 million in capitalized interest related to an increase in capital expenditures between the years and the resumption of construction activity on previously suspended projects combined with a $19 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings.Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $651 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 mainly as a result of higher operating income in 2011 and a one-time $20 million income tax benefit recognized in 2010 related to a tax settlement with the Government of Aruba (GOA).The loss from discontinued operations of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily due to adjustments to the working capital settlement related to the sale of our Paulsboro Refinery in December 2010. The loss from discontinued operations of $599 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 represents a $47 million after-tax loss from the discontinued operations of the Delaware City and Paulsboro Refineries and a $610 million after-tax loss on the sale of the Paulsboro Refinery, partially offset by a $58 million after-tax gain on the sale of the shutdown refinery assets at Delaware City.46Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2012Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $5.3 billion compared to $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the increase in operating income discussed above under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,” after excluding the effect of the asset impairment loss included in the 2012 operating income that had no effect on cash. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2012 combined with $300 million of proceeds from the remarketing of the 4.0% Gulf Opportunity Zone Revenue Bonds Series 2010 (GO Zone Bonds), $1.1 billion of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and $1.5 billion of proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable sales facility were used mainly to: •fund $3.4 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;•redeem our Series 1997 5.6%, Series 1998 5.6%, Series 1999 5.7%, Series 2001 6.65%, and Series 1997A 5.45% industrial revenue bonds for $108 million;•make scheduled long-term note repayments of $754 million;•repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $1.1 billion;•make repayments under our accounts receivable sales facility of $1.7 billion;•purchase common stock for treasury of $281 million;•pay common stock dividends of $360 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $699 million.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2011Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $4.0 billion compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the $1.8 billion increase in operating income discussed above under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.” Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2011 due to significant increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of 2011 compared to such prices at the end of 2010.The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2011 combined with $150 million of proceeds from the sale of receivables and $2.3 billion from available cash on hand was used mainly to: •fund $3.0 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;•purchase the Pembroke Refinery and the related marketing and logistics business for $1.7 billion;•purchase the Meraux Refinery for $547 million;•redeem our Series 1997B 5.4% and Series 1997C 5.4% industrial revenue bonds for $56 million;•make scheduled long-term note repayments of $418 million;•acquire the GO Zone Revenue Bonds Series 2010 for $300 million;•purchase our common stock for $349 million; and•pay common stock dividends of $169 million.Capital InvestmentsOur operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units 47Table of Contentsare improved continuously. The cost of improvements, which consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, can be significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process higher volumes of sour crude oil, which lowers our feedstock costs, and enables us to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly.During the year ended December 31, 2012, we expended $2.9 billion for capital expenditures and $479 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2012 included $135 million of costs related to environmental projects.For 2013, we expect to incur approximately $1.9 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $100 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $600 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to future strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 are summarized below (in millions).

In July 2012, we amended our agreement to increase the facility from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion and extended the maturity date to July 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we sold $1.5 billion of interests in eligible receivables to the third-party entities and financial institutions under this facility, and we repaid $1.7 billion under this facility. As of December 31, 2012, the amount of eligible receivables sold was $100 million. All amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt.Our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of December 31, 2012, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows:Rating Agency RatingStandard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (negative outlook)Moody’s Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook)Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook)We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.Operating Lease ObligationsOur operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks, refined product, and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed 49Table of Contentsor minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2012, our short- and long-term purchase obligations decreased by approximately $3 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2011. The decrease is primarily attributable to contracts expiring in 2013.Other Long-term LiabilitiesOur other long-term liabilities are described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2012.Other Commercial CommitmentsAs of December 31, 2012, our committed lines of credit were as follows (in millions): BorrowingCapacity Expiration OutstandingLetters of CreditLetter of credit facilities $550 June 2013 $418U.S. revolving credit facility $3,000 December 2016 $59Canadian revolving credit facility C$50 November 2013 C$10As of December 31, 2012, we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities. The letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2012 expire during 2013 and 2014.Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Purchase ProgramsAs of December 31, 2012, we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately $3.3 billion of our common stock.Pension Plan FundingWe have $30 million of minimum required contributions to one of our international pension plans during 2013. In addition, we plan to contribute approximately $115 million to our other pension plans and $21 million to our other postretirement plans during 2013.On February 15, 2013, we announced changes to certain of our pension plans that will reduce our benefit costs and obligations for 2013 and future years, as further discussed in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These changes, however, will not impact our planned contributions during 2013, but we expect future contributions to decline.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters.50Table of ContentsTax MattersWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. See Notes 12 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax matters.As of December 31, 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal tax returns from 2002 through 2009, as discussed in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have received Revenue Agent Reports on our tax years for 2002 through 2007 and we are vigorously contesting many of the tax positions and assertions from the IRS. Although we believe our tax liabilities are fairly stated and properly reflected in our financial statements, should the IRS eventually prevail, it could result in a material amount of our deferred tax liabilities being reclassified to current liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.Cash Held by Our International SubsidiariesWe operate in countries outside the U.S. through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries, and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the U.S. in the form of cash dividends. Should we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated. In addition, such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations, as further discussed in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe, however, that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the U.S. without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings. As of December 31, 2012, $1.1 billion of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries.Financial Regulatory ReformIn July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform Act). Key provisions of the Wall Street Reform Act create new statutory requirements that require most derivative instruments to be traded on exchanges and routed through clearinghouses, as well as impose new recordkeeping and reporting responsibilities on market participants. While certain final rules implementing the Wall Street Reform Act became effective in the fourth quarter of 2012, others will not become effective until 2013; therefore, the ultimate impact to our operations is yet unknown. However, the implementation could result in higher clearing costs and more reporting requirements with respect to our derivative activities.Concentration of CustomersOur refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.51Table of ContentsSources of LiquidityWe believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAs discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our financial statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable.Property, Plant and EquipmentThe cost of property, plant and equipment (property assets) purchased or constructed, including betterments of property assets, are capitalized. However, the cost of repairs to and normal maintenance of property assets is expensed as incurred. Betterments of property assets are those which either extend the useful life, increase the capacity or improve the operating efficiency of the asset, or improve the safety of our operations. The cost of property assets constructed includes interest and certain overhead costs allocable to the construction activities.Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are improved continuously. Improvements consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.Depreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation. We maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries. We estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group, and such evaluations consist of, but are not limited to, the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition, consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained, assessment of the need to replace assets, and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group. The estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years.52Table of ContentsUnder the composite method of depreciation, the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life. We design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications, design standards and practices accepted in our industry, and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives. Therefore, we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group. It should be noted, however, that factors such as competition, regulation, or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting depreciation expense in the future.Also under the composite method of depreciation, the historical cost of a minor property asset (net of salvage value) that is retired or replaced is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in income. However, a gain or loss is recognized in income for a major property asset that is retired, replaced or sold and for an abnormal disposition of a property asset (primarily involuntary conversions). Gains and losses are reflected in depreciation and amortization expense, unless such amounts are reported separately due to materiality.Impairment of AssetsLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and refinery turnaround and catalyst costs, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. In order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from those analyses.We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our 53Table of Contentsown internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes.The amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 is included in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit ObligationsWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements. For example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2012 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2013 (in millions): Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefitsIncrease in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease$109 $12Compensation rate increase36 n/aHealth care cost trend rate increasen/a 4 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease17 —Expected return on plan assets decrease4 n/aCompensation rate increase9 n/aHealth care cost trend rate increasen/a —See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. As discussed in Note 14, we announced changes to certain of our pension plans on February 15, 2013 that will reduce our benefit costs and obligations for 2013 and future years.54Table of ContentsTax MattersWe record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to an indirect tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. See Notes 12 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities.Legal MattersA variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.55Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to hedge:•inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels and •forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of these forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows.Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): Derivative Instruments Held For Non-Trading Purposes TradingPurposesDecember 31, 2012: Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices$(131) $(9)10% decrease in underlying commodity prices135 (1) December 31, 2011: Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices(156) 110% decrease in underlying commodity prices156 2See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2012.56Table of ContentsCOMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of financial instruments associated withvarious governmental and regulatory compliance programs that we must purchase in the open market to comply with these programs. To reduce the impact of this risk on our results of operations and cash flows, we may enter into derivative instruments, such as futures. As of December 31, 2012, there was no gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the futures contracts. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs and notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2012.INTEREST RATE RISKThe following table provides information about our debt instruments, excluding capital lease obligations (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.

In addition, during 2013, we recorded a $325 million nontaxable gain related to the disposition of our retained interest in CST Brands, Inc. (CST), which is more fully described in Notes 3 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding these significant items, net income attributable to Valero stockholders for 2013 declined by $702 million due primarily to lower refining segment operating income as discussed below.Our operating income decreased $47 million from 2012 to 2013 as outlined by business segment in the following table (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 ChangeOperating income (loss) by business segment: Refining $4,217 $4,450 $(233)Retail 81 348 (267)Ethanol 491 (47) 538Corporate (826) (741) (85)Total $3,963 $4,010 $(47)Operating income for 2012 was negatively impacted by asset impairment losses of $1.0 billion, of which $928 million related to our Aruba refinery (as further discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and severance expense of $41 million, which was also related to our Aruba Refinery (as further discussed in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding these significant items, total operating income and refining segment operating income for 2012 would have been $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, resulting in a $1.1 billion decrease in total operating income and a $1.3 billion decrease in refining segment operating income from 2012 to 2013. The $1.3 billion decrease in refining segment operating income for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to lower refining margins in each of our regions. The decrease in refining margins was the result of lower gasoline margins, lower discounts on light sweet crude oils, and higher costs of biofuel credits (primarily Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) needed to comply with the U.S. federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)), which were partially offset by higher distillate margins and higher discounts on sour crude oils between the years.On May 1, 2013, we completed the separation of our retail business by spinning off 80 percent of CST as an independent public company. As a result, we no longer operate a retail business and had no retail segment operating results after April 30, 2013, resulting in the $267 million decrease in retail segment operating income for 2013 compared to 2012. The separation of our retail business is more fully discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 25Table of ContentsOur ethanol segment operating income in 2013 increased $538 million compared to 2012 due to higher gross margin per gallon of ethanol and higher production volumes. Lower corn prices and higher ethanol prices contributed to the improved gross margin. We increased our production of ethanol following the first quarter of 2013 to capture the improved economics of higher gross margins per gallon during 2013.On December 16, 2013, Valero Energy Partners LP (VLP) completed its initial public offering of 17,250,000 common units at a price of $23.00 per unit, which included a 2,250,000 common unit over-allotment option that was fully exercised by the underwriters. VLP received $369 million in net proceeds from the sale of the units, after deducting underwriting fees, structuring fees and other offering costs. VLP’s initial assets include crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline and terminal systems in the U.S. Gulf Coast and U.S. Mid-Continent regions that are integral to the operations of our Port Arthur, McKee, and Memphis Refineries. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.OutlookOur refining segment benefits from processing sour crude oils (such as Maya crude oil) in our U.S. Gulf Coast region and light sweet crude oils (such as WTI crude oil) in our U.S. Mid-Continent region due to the favorable discounts between the prices of these types of crude oil and the price of Brent crude oil. Because the market for refined products generally tracks the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. The discounts in the prices of light sweet and sour crude oils compared to the price of Brent crude oil widened significantly during the fourth quarter of 2013. For the first quarter of 2014, discounts on light sweet and sour crude oils narrowed slightly compared to the fourth quarter and we expect these discounts to remain volatile for the remainder of the first quarter. In addition, gasoline margins across all regions were seasonally weak during the fourth quarter of 2013 and remain seasonally weak thus far in the first quarter of 2014. Distillate margins across all regions, thus far in 2014, have remained consistent with those realized during the fourth quarter of 2013. We are exposed to the volatility in the market prices of crude oil and refined products, and we expect such prices to continue to be volatile in the near to mid-term.We are also exposed to the volatility in the market price of biofuel credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.), which we purchase in the open market to meet our obligation to blend biofuels into the products we produce. To date during the first quarter of 2014, the market price of RINs has increased compared to year end levels, but the price remains lower than prices experienced during 2013. Therefore, we estimate that the cost of meeting our obligation for the full year of 2014 will be between $250 million and $350 million. Because the market price of RINs is volatile and is significantly impacted by biofuel blending rates that are established by the EPA, it is difficult for us to predict reliably the market price of RINs. 26Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market prices that directly impact our operations.

following notes relate to references on pages 27 through 31.(a)On May 1, 2013, we completed the separation of our retail business by spinning off 80 percent of CST. This transaction is more fully discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result and effective May 1, 2013, our results of operations no longer include those of CST, except for our share of CST’s results of operations associated with the equity interest in CST retained by us through November 14, 2013, which is reflected in “other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2013. The nature and significance of our post-separation participation in the supply of motor fuel to CST represents a continuation of activities with CST for accounting purposes. As such, the historical results of operations related to CST have not been reported as discontinued operations in the statements of income. In October 2013, we borrowed $525 million under a short-term debt agreement with a third-party financial institution in anticipation of liquidating our retained interest in CST. This liquidation was completed on November 14, 2013 by transferring all remaining shares of CST common stock owned by us to the financial institution in exchange for $467 million of our short-term debt, and we paid the remaining $58 million of short-term debt in cash. After paying $19 million of fees, we recognized a $325 million nontaxable gain.(b)In September 2012, we decided to reorganize our Aruba Refinery into a crude oil and refined products terminal. The reorganization resulted in the termination of the majority of our employees in Aruba, and we recognized severance expense of $41 million in September 2012. This expense is reflected in refining segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, but it is excluded from operating costs per barrel for the refining segment and the U.S. Gulf Coast region. No income tax benefits were recognized related to this severance expense.(c)Asset impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2012 include a $928 million loss on the write-down of the Aruba Refinery. In addition, we recorded asset impairment losses of $65 million ($42 million after taxes) related to equipment associated with permanently cancelled capital projects at several of our refineries and $21 million ($13 million after taxes) related to certain retail stores in 2012 that we owned prior to the separation of our retail business. The total asset impairment losses of $1.0 billion are reflected in the operating income of the respective segments for the year ended December 31, 2012, but the asset impairment losses associated with the Aruba Refinery and the cancelled capital projects are excluded from the operating costs per barrel and operating income per barrel for the refining segment and the U.S. Gulf Coast region. (d)U.S. Mid-Continent product specifications for gasoline changed on September 16, 2013 from Conventional 87 gasoline to CBOB gasoline. Therefore, average market reference prices for comparable products meeting the new specifications required in this region are now being provided for all periods presented.(e)Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.(f)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.(g)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Aruba, Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. 32Table of ContentsGeneralOperating revenues decreased $1.2 billion (or 1 percent) for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of lower average refined product prices between the two years related to our refining segment operations. In addition, operating income decreased $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to a $233 million decrease in refining segment operating income, a $267 million decrease in retail segment operating income, and a $60 million increase in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $538 million increase in ethanol segment operating income. The reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments and general and administrative expenses, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed below.RefiningRefining segment operating income decreased $233 million from $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 to $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013. Excluding asset impairment losses and severance expenses of $993 million and $41 million in 2012 primarily related to our Aruba Refinery, which are more fully described in Notes 4 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively, refining segment operating income decreased $1.3 billion from 2012 to 2013. The decrease in refining segment operating income was primarily due to a $994 million decrease in refining margin, a $196 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, and a $36 million increase in operating expenses.Refining margin decreased $994 million (a $1.27 per barrel decrease) in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the following:•Decrease in gasoline margins - We experienced a decline in gasoline margins throughout all of our regions during 2013 compared to 2012. For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent CBOB gasoline was $16.77 per barrel during 2013 compared to $25.40 per barrel during 2012, representing an unfavorable decrease of $8.63 per barrel. We estimate that the decline in gasoline margins per barrel during 2013 compared to 2012 had a negative impact to our refining margin of approximately $790 million for all refining regions.•Lower discounts on WTI-type crude oils in the U.S. Mid-Continent region - Because the market for refined products generally tracks the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. In 2013, the discount in the price of WTI compared to the price of Brent crude oil narrowed compared to 2012. WTI crude oil sold at a discount of $10.80 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2013 compared to a discount of $17.55 per barrel in 2012, representing an unfavorable decrease of $6.75 per barrel. Therefore, the lower discount on WTI-type crude oils that we processed negatively impacted our refining margin. We estimate that the decrease in the discounts for WTI-type crude oils that we processed during 2013 reduced our refining margin by approximately $640 million.•Higher costs of biofuel credits - As more fully described in Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we must purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending obligation under various government and regulatory compliance programs, and the cost of these credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) increased by $267 million from $250 million in 2012 to $517 million in 2013. This increase was due to an increase in the market price of RINs caused by an expectation in the market of a shortage in available RINs.•Increase in distillate margins - Despite lower distillate prices throughout all of our regions during 2013 compared to 2012, we experienced an increase in distillate margins during 2013 compared to 2012 as a 33Table of Contentsresult of increased production volumes of distillate between the years. This production volume increase of 66,000 barrels per day was primarily due to the start up of our new hydrocracker units at our Port Arthur and St. Charles Refineries, resulting in a $370 million increase in our refining margin in 2013.•Higher discounts on medium sour crude oils - In 2013, the discount in the price of medium sour crude oils compared to the price of Brent crude oil widened. For example, Mars crude oil, which is a medium sour crude oil, sold at a discount of $5.52 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2013 compared to a discount of $3.97 per barrel during 2012, representing a favorable increase of $1.55 per barrel.Therefore, the higher discounts on the medium sour crude oils we processed favorably impacted our refining margin. We estimate that the increase in the discounts for medium sour crude oils that we processed during 2013 had a favorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $260 million.The increase of $36 million in operating expenses was primarily due to a $185 million increase in energy costs related to higher natural gas costs and higher use of natural gas associated with our new hydrocracker units at our Port Arthur and St. Charles Refineries. This increase was partially offset by a $124 million decrease in operating expenses incurred by the Aruba Refinery, whose operations were suspended in March 2012.The increase of $196 million in depreciation and amortization expense was due to additional depreciation expense primarily associated with our new hydrocracker units at our Port Arthur and St. Charles Refineries that began operating in late 2012 and the third quarter of 2013, respectively, and an increase in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization.RetailRetail segment operating income was $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $348 million for the year December 31, 2012. The $267 million decrease was primarily due to the separation of our retail business on May 1, 2013, which is more fully described in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of the separation, retail segment operating income for 2013 reflects the operations of our former retail business for only the first four months of 2013.EthanolEthanol segment operating income was $491 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to an operating loss of $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The $538 million increase in operating income was primarily due to a $596 million increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $55 million increase in operating expenses.Ethanol gross margin per gallon increased $0.47 per gallon from $0.30 per gallon in 2012 to $0.77 per gallon in 2013 due to the following:•Lower corn prices - Corn prices decreased year over year as many of the corn-producing regions of the U.S. Mid-Continent recovered from a drought that began in the second quarter of 2012. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade corn price was $5.80 per bushel in 2013 compared to $6.94 per bushel in 2012. The decrease in the price of corn that we processed during 2013 favorably impacted our ethanol margin by approximately $290 million.•Higher ethanol prices - Ethanol prices increased year over year due to a decrease in the supply of ethanol in the market. The decrease in supply resulted from reduced production in 2012 and early 2013 as the industry responded to a narrowing of ethanol gross margin per gallon, which were due to higher corn prices primarily caused by the drought in the corn-producing regions of the U.S. Mid- 34Table of ContentsContinent described above. By mid-2013, ethanol inventory levels in the U.S. had declined to their lowest level in over three years and as a result, prices increased significantly beginning late in the first quarter of 2013. For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $2.53 per gallon in 2013 compared to $2.37 per gallon in 2012. The increase in the price of ethanol per gallon during 2013 had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $160 million.•Increased production volumes - Ethanol margin also improved due to increased production volumes between the years of 327,000 gallons per day in 2013 compared to 2012 in response to the improved ethanol gross margin per gallon. The increase in production volumes during 2013 had a favorable impact to our ethanol gross margin of approximately $85 million.The $55 million increase in operating expenses during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a $40 million increase in energy costs compared to 2012 resulting from higher natural gas prices during 2013 and a $12 million year over year increase in chemical costs due to higher production.Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses increased $60 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to $52 million of environmental and legal reserve adjustments that were recorded during 2013 and $30 million for transaction costs related to the separation of our retail business on May 1, 2013. These increases were partially offset by an $11 million reduction in insurance reserves during 2013. The increase in corporate depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to $20 million of losses incurred on the sale of certain corporate property.During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a nontaxable gain of $325 million, or $0.60 per share, related to the disposition of our retained interest in CST, which is more fully described in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” for year ended December 31, 2013 increased $52 million from the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to a $103 million decrease in capitalized interest due to completion of several large capital projects, including the new hydrocrackers at our Port Arthur and St. Charles Refineries, offset by a $44 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings and a $12 million write-off of unamortized debt discounts related to the early redemption of certain industrial revenue bonds in the first quarter of 2012.Income tax expense decreased $372 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2013. The variation in the customary relationship between income tax expense and income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to the nontaxable gain on the disposition of our retained interest in CST. The variation in the customary relationship between income tax expense and income before income tax expense for 2012 was primarily due to not recognizing the tax benefits associated with the asset impairment loss of $928 million and the severance expense of $41 million related to the Aruba Refinery as we did not expect to realize a tax benefit from these losses. 35Table of Contents2012 Compared

contracts related to the forward sales of refined product. These contracts were closed and realized during the first quarter of 2011. This loss is reflected in refining segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, but throughput margin per barrel for the refining segment excludes this $542 million loss ($0.61 per barrel). In addition, operating income and throughput margin per barrel for the U.S. Gulf Coast, the U.S. Mid-Continent, and the U.S. West Coast regions for the year ended December 31, 2011 exclude the portion of this loss that had been allocated to them of $372 million ($0.70 per barrel), $122 million ($0.81 per barrel), and $48 million ($0.51 per barrel), respectively.(d)In September 2012, we decided to reorganize our Aruba Refinery into a crude oil and refined products terminal. The reorganization resulted in the termination of the majority of our employees in Aruba, and we recognized severance expense of $41 million in September 2012. This expense is reflected in refining segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, but it is excluded from operating costs per barrel for the refining segment and the U.S. Gulf Coast region. No income tax benefits were recognized related to this severance expense.(e)Asset impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2012 include a $928 million loss on the write-down of the Aruba Refinery. In addition, we recorded asset impairment losses of $65 million ($42 million after taxes) related to equipment associated with a permanently cancelled capital project at another refinery and $21 million ($13 million after taxes) related to certain retail stores in 2012. The total asset impairment losses of $1.0 billion are reflected in the operating income of the respective segments for the year ended December 31, 2012, but the asset impairment losses associated with the Aruba Refinery and the cancelled capital projects are excluded from the operating costs per barrel and operating income per barrel for the refining segment and the U.S. Gulf Coast region.(f)Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.(g)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.(h)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes Aruba, Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S.West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.(i)U.S. Mid-Continent product specifications for gasoline changed on September 16, 2013 to CBOB gasoline. Therefore, average market reference prices for comparable products meeting the new specifications required in this region are now being provided for all periods presented.GeneralOperating revenues increased 11 percent (or $13.3 billion) for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices for most of the products we produce and higher throughput volumes between the two years related to our refining segment operations. Refined product prices are most significantly influenced by the price of crude oil, which is a worldwide commodity whose price is influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to, worldwide supply and demand characteristics, worldwide political conditions, and worldwide economic conditions. However, regional factors also impact the price of refined product prices in those geographic regions. Regional factors can be similar to those that affect the worldwide price of crude oil, but they can also be significantly influenced by weather conditions that disrupt the supply of and demand for refined products in the region. For example, in October 2012, Hurricane Sandy struck the U.S. East Coast and disrupted the supply of 41Table of Contentsrefined products in that region for some time, which contributed to the increase of $5.99 per barrel in the North Atlantic benchmark reference price of CBOB gasoline in 2012 compared to 2011. The higher throughput volumes in 2012 resulted primarily from the incremental throughput of 75,000 BPD from the Meraux Refinery, which was acquired on October 1, 2011, and incremental throughput of 95,000 BPD from the Pembroke Refinery, which was acquired on August 1, 2011.Operating income increased $330 million and income from continuing operations before income tax expense increased $384 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2011 due to a $934 million increase in refining segment operating income, a $33 million decrease in retail segment operating income, a $443 million decrease in ethanol segment operating income, and a $128 million increase in corporate expenses. The reasons for these changes are described below.RefiningRefining segment operating income increased from $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 to $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was impacted by asset impairment losses of $928 million related to the Aruba Refinery and $65 million related to cancelled capital projects in 2012, $41 million of severance expense related to the Aruba Refinery, and a $542 million loss on derivative contracts in 2011. (See Notes 4 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of the asset impairment losses and the severance expense, respectively). Excluding these amounts, our refining segment operating income increased $1.4 billion from $4.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 to $5.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. This $1.4 billion improvement in operating income was primarily due to a $1.7 billion increase in refining margin, partially offset by a $262 million increase in operating expenses.The $1.7 billion increase in refining margin (a $1.05 per barrel, or 11 percent, increase between 2012 and 2011) was primarily the result of improvements in the margin generated in our U.S. Mid-Continent and North Atlantic regions, which experienced increases in refining margin of $526 million (a $2.58 per barrel increase), and $821 million (a $3.81 per barrel increase), respectively.The $526 million increase in refining margin in the U.S. Mid-Continent region was largely due to improved gasoline and distillate margins in that region in 2012 compared to 2011. For example, the U.S. Mid-Continent benchmark reference margins for CBOB gasoline (conventional 87 gasoline prior to September 16, 2013) and ultra-low-sulfur diesel, a type of distillate, increased year over year by $3.03 per barrel and $3.90 per barrel, respectively, and these increases were primarily the result of a $1.67 per barrel increase in the discount between the price of WTI crude oil versus Brent crude oil. Brent crude oil is the type of crude oil used by the market to set the price of refined products, but our refineries in the U.S. Mid-Continent region primarily process WTI-type crude oil; therefore, the increase in the price discount between WTI crude oil versus Brent crude oil had a positive impact to our refining margin in this region of approximately $300 million. WTI crude oil priced at a significant discount to Brent crude oil during 2012 because of increases in crude oil reserves within the U.S. Mid-Continent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into that region, coupled with the inability to transport significant quantities of that crude oil to refineries in other regions of the country.The $821 million increase in refining margin in the North Atlantic region was also due to improved gasoline and distillate margins in that region in 2012 compared to 2011. For example, the North Atlantic benchmark reference margins for CBOB gasoline and ultra-low-sulfur diesel increased year over year by $4.71 per barrel and $3.42 per barrel, respectively, and these increases were due largely to a reduction in the supply of refined products, which resulted from the continued shutdown of refineries in the U.S. East Coast, Caribbean, and 42Table of ContentsWestern Europe during 2012, and supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Sandy, which struck the U.S. East Coast in October 2012.The increase of $262 million in operating expenses discussed above was primarily due to an increase of $123 million in operating expenses of the Meraux Refinery, an increase of $214 million in operating expenses incurred by the Pembroke Refinery, and a decrease of $123 million in operating expenses incurred by the Aruba Refinery. We acquired the Pembroke Refinery on August 1, 2011 and the Meraux Refinery on October 1, 2011; therefore, operating expenses for 2011 only reflected five months of operating expenses of the Pembroke Refinery and three months of operating expenses of the Meraux Refinery. In addition, in March 2012, we suspended the operations of the Aruba Refinery, which resulted in a significant decrease in operating expenses related to that refinery in 2012. The remaining increase in operating expenses of $48 million was primarily due to an increase of $31 million in employee-related expenses due to higher compensation expense related to merit increases and promotions and higher expenses for employee benefit costs, an increase of $9 million in catalyst and chemical costs due to higher prices of rare earth metals used in our fluid catalytic cracking units, an increase of $61 million in ad valorem taxes and insurance expense due to increased insurance reserves in 2012 combined with a nonrecurring favorable ad valorem tax adjustment in 2011, and a decrease of $63 million in energy costs due to lower natural gas prices. Even though operating expenses increased year over year, operating expenses per barrel in 2012 were comparable to 2011 due to the incremental throughput of 179,000 BPD, which primarily resulted from the incremental throughput of the Pembroke and Meraux Refineries discussed above.RetailRetail operating income was $348 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $381 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This 9 percent (or $33 million) decrease was primarily due to a $21 million noncash asset impairment loss related to certain convenience stores (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), a $56 million decrease in fuel margin from our Canadian retail operations, and a $41 million increase in fuel margin in our U.S. retail operations. The Canadian retail fuel margin for 2012 was impacted by a decline in fuel volumes sold as a result of fewer retail sites combined with a decline in the fuel margin per gallon, which was due to pricing pressure from our competitors and changes in wholesale motor fuel prices during the year. Our U.S. retail fuel margin improved during 2012 due to increased fuel volumes sold as a result of more retail sites combined with improved fuel margin per gallon as wholesale motor fuel prices peaked in March 2012 and declined throughout the remainder of the year.EthanolEthanol segment operating loss was $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to operating income of $396 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease of $443 million was primarily due to a $507 million decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a $67 million decrease in operating expenses.The decrease in gross margin was due to a 56 percent decrease in the gross margin per gallon of ethanol production (a $0.38 per gallon decrease between the comparable periods) primarily due to lower ethanol prices in 2012 versus 2011. Ethanol prices during 2012 were pressured by a surplus of ethanol supply due to reduced demand for ethanol associated with the decline in gasoline demand in the U.S., lower exports of ethanol to Europe, and increased imports of ethanol from Brazil. In addition, ethanol production decreased 385,000 gallons per day between the comparable periods due to lower utilization rates at our ethanol plants during 2012. The reduction in operating expenses was due primarily to a $57 million decrease in energy 43Table of Contentscosts resulting from decreased consumption because of the lower utilization rates previously discussed, combined with lower natural gas prices versus the comparable period of 2011.Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses increased $127 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 due to $58 million in administrative costs related to our European operations, which we acquired on August 1, 2011, a $23 million increase in employee benefits expense (primarily related to increased costs for medical and retirement benefits), and favorable legal settlements of $47 million in 2011, which did not recur in 2012.“Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $34 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 due to an increase of $15 million of foreign currency transaction losses, an $11 million reduction in interest income due to the collection of a note receivable from PBF Holdings LLC in February 2012, and a $7 million reduction in bank interest income due to lower levels of temporary cash investments during 2012 as compared to the prior year.“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $88 million from the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease is primarily due to an increase of $69 million in capitalized interest related to an increase in capital expenditures between the years and a $33 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings, partially offset by a $12 million write-off of unamortized debt discounts related to the early redemption of certain industrial revenue bonds in the first quarter of 2012.Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased $400 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 partially as a result of higher operating income in 2012. The variation in the customary relationship between income tax expense and income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily due to not recognizing the tax benefits associated with the asset impairment loss of $928 million and the severance expense of $41 million related to the Aruba Refinery as we do not expect to realize a tax benefit from these losses. 44Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2013Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $5.6 billion compared to $5.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2013 combined with $735 million of net cash received in connection with the separation of our retail business (consisting of $550 million of proceeds on short-term debt, a $500 million cash distribution from CST less $315 million of cash retained by CST), and $525 million of proceeds on short-term debt related to the disposition of our retained interest in CST were used mainly to:•fund $2.8 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;•make scheduled long-term note repayments of $480 million;•make a short-term debt repayment of $58 million;•purchase common stock for treasury of $928 million;•pay common stock dividends of $462 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $2.2 billion.In addition, VLP completed its initial public offering of common units for net proceeds of $369 million. Because we consolidate VLP’s financial statements, the total cash reported by us also increased by these net proceeds; however, such proceeds can only be used by VLP for its purposes.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2012Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $5.3 billion compared to $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the increase in operating income discussed above under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,” after excluding the effect of the asset impairment loss included in the 2012 operating income that had no effect on cash. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2012 combined with $300 million of proceeds from the remarketing of the 4.0% Gulf Opportunity Zone Revenue Bonds Series 2010 (GO Zone Bonds), $1.1 billion of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and $1.5 billion of proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable sales facility were used mainly to: •fund $3.4 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;•redeem our Series 1997 5.6%, Series 1998 5.6%, Series 1999 5.7%, Series 2001 6.65%, and Series 1997A 5.45% industrial revenue bonds for $108 million;•make scheduled long-term note repayments of $754 million;•repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $1.1 billion;•make repayments under our accounts receivable sales facility of $1.7 billion;•purchase common stock for treasury of $281 million;•pay common stock dividends of $360 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $699 million.Capital InvestmentsOur operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and 45Table of Contentsinterdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are improved continuously. The cost of improvements, which consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, can be significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly.For 2014, we expect to incur approximately $2.3 billion for capital expenditures and approximately $700 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to potential strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter TotalDebt and capitallease obligations (including interest on capital lease obligations)$308 $483 $7 $957 $6 $4,851 $6,612Operating lease obligations305 230 162 111 95 321 1,224Purchase obligations33,159 3,501 994 453 279 1,126 39,512Other long-term liabilities— 138 113 112 103 863 1,329Total$33,772 $4,352 $1,276 $1,633 $483 $7,161 $48,677Debt and Capital Lease ObligationsDuring 2013, we made scheduled long-term note repayments of $480 million as described in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis up to $1.5 billion. As of December 31, 2013, the amount of eligible receivables sold was $100 million. All amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt.Our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements 46Table of Contentswould increase. As of December 31, 2013, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows:Rating Agency RatingMoody’s Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook)Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (negative outlook)Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook)We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.Operating Lease ObligationsOur operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks, refined product, and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2013, there was no significant change in the amount of our short- and long-term purchase obligations as compared to December 31, 2012. Other Long-term LiabilitiesOur other long-term liabilities are described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2013. 47Table of ContentsOther Commercial CommitmentsAs of December 31, 2013, our outstanding letters of credit under our committed lines of credit were as follows (in millions): BorrowingCapacity Expiration OutstandingLetters of CreditLetter of credit facilities $550 June 2014 $278U.S. revolving credit facility $3,000 November 2018 $59Canadian revolving credit facility C$50 November 2014 C$10As of December 31, 2013, we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities. The letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2013 expire during 2014 and 2015.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Purchase ProgramsAs of December 31, 2013, we have approvals under common stock purchase programs to purchase approximately $2.6 billion of our common stock. In January 2014, we purchased 4 million shares for $208 million.Pension Plan FundingWe plan to contribute approximately $38 million to our pension plans and $19 million to our postretirement plans during 2014.On February 15, 2013, we announced changes to certain of our pension plans that reduced our pension obligations. In addition, we expect that these changes will also reduce our benefit costs for future years, as further discussed in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Notes 10 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters.Tax MattersDuring the first quarter of 2014, we expect to pay approximately $400 million in tax payments that relate to 2013 and that were recorded in income taxes payable as of December 31, 2013. In addition, we currently believe the cash we will pay for income taxes for 2014 will increase and that such amount may exceed the total income tax expense that will be reflected on our statement of income. This belief is primarily due to an expected decrease in deductions that we will claim on our U.S. federal income tax return for depreciation 48Table of Contentson our property, plant, and equipment. In prior years, the U.S. federal government enacted certain legislation that provided for the deduction of depreciation on an accelerated basis on newly built equipment as a means of encouraging capital investment by businesses. This legislation, however, generally does not extend beyond 2013. Although we expect the amount of cash required to pay our 2014 income taxes to increase compared to recent prior years, we believe that we will generate sufficient cash from operations and have sufficient cash on hand to make our tax payments as they become due.As of December 31, 2013, the IRS has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal tax returns from 2002 through 2011. We have received Revenue Agent Reports in connection with the 2002 through 2009 audits, and we are vigorously contesting certain tax positions and assertions from the IRS. We made significant progress during 2013 in resolving certain of these matters, and in January 2014, we settled the audit related to the 2004 and 2005 tax years for a group of our subsidiaries for an amount consistent with the recorded amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with that audit. We are continuing to work with the IRS to resolve the remaining matters and expect to settle other audits within the next 12 months for amounts consistent with the recorded amounts of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those audits. Because these settlements are expected to occur in 2014, we classified certain of our long-term uncertain tax position liabilities to current liabilities as of December 31, 2013. The total amount of uncertain tax position liabilities was $443 million as of December 31, 2013, with $238 million reflected in “income taxes payable” and $205 million reflected in “other long-term liabilities”, and this total amount did not change significantly during the year ended December 31, 2013. Should we ultimately settle for amounts consistent with our estimates, we believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand at that time to make such payments.Cash Held by Our International SubsidiariesWe operate in countries outside the U.S. through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries, and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the U.S. in the form of cash dividends. Should we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated. In addition, such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations, as further discussed in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe, however, that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the U.S. without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings. As of December 31, 2013, $1.1 billion of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries.Financial Regulatory ReformIn July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform Act). Key provisions of the Wall Street Reform Act create new statutory requirements that require most derivative instruments to be traded on exchanges and routed through clearinghouses, as well as impose new recordkeeping and reporting responsibilities on market participants. While certain final rules implementing the Wall Street Reform Act became effective in the fourth quarter of 2012, others continue to become effective in 2013 and 2014. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these rules, which may result in higher clearing costs and more reporting requirements with respect to our derivative activities, we believe they will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.Concentration of CustomersOur refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts 49Table of Contentsreceivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.Sources of LiquidityWe believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAs discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will become effective for our financial statements in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable.Property, Plant, and EquipmentDepreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation. We maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries. We estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group, and such evaluations consist of, but are not limited to, the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition, consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained, assessment of the need to replace assets, and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group. The estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years.Under the composite method of depreciation, the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life. We design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications, design standards and practices accepted in our industry, and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives. Therefore, we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group. It should be noted, however, that factors such as competition, regulation, or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting depreciation expense in the future. 50Table of ContentsImpairment of AssetsLong-lived assets (which include property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and refinery turnaround and catalyst costs) and equity method investments are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. In order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from those analyses.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes.The amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 is included in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit ObligationsWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates, and these assumptions are disclosed and described in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we utilized a forward- 51Table of Contentslooking model of asset returns. The historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to December 31, 2013 was 8.86 percent. The actual return on assets for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was 19.38 percent, 11.84 percent, and 0.10 percent, respectively. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements. For example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2013 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2014 (in millions): Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefitsIncrease in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease$83 $10Compensation rate increase6 n/aHealth care cost trend rate increasen/a 1 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease8 —Expected return on plan assets decrease4 n/aCompensation rate increase2 n/aHealth care cost trend rate increasen/a —See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.Tax MattersWe record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to an indirect tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. See Notes 12 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities.Legal MattersA variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of 52Table of Contentsrelevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. 53Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to hedge:•inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels and •forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows.Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): Derivative Instruments Held For Non-Trading Purposes TradingPurposesDecember 31, 2013: Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices$(91) $310% decrease in underlying commodity prices91 (2) December 31, 2012: Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices(131) (9)10% decrease in underlying commodity prices135 (1)See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2013.COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs. To manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase 54Table of Contentsthese credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. As of December 31, 2013, there was no gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs.INTEREST RATE RISKThe following table provides information about our debt instruments, excluding capital lease obligations (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” included in this report.CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995This report, including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK,” includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “projection,” “predict,” “budget,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “target,” “could,” “should,” “may,” and similar expressions.These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding:•future refining margins, including gasoline and distillate margins;•future ethanol margins;•expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil differentials, and operating expenses;•anticipated levels of crude oil and refined product inventories;•our anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred refinery turnaround and catalyst costs and capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and the effect of these capital investments on our results of operations;•anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products in the regions where we operate, as well as globally;•expectations regarding environmental, tax, and other regulatory initiatives; and•the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining and ethanol industry fundamentals.We based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following:•acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined products or receive feedstocks;•political and economic conditions in nations that produce crude oil or consume refined products;•demand for, and supplies of, refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, and ethanol;•demand for, and supplies of, crude oil and other feedstocks;•the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls;•the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations;•refinery overcapacity or undercapacity;•our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations; 23•the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and adjustments to refining capacity in response to market conditions;•the level of competitors’ imports into markets that we supply;•accidents, unscheduled shutdowns, or other catastrophes affecting our refineries, machinery, pipelines, equipment, and information systems, or those of our suppliers or customers;•changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined products;•the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles;•the levels of government subsidies for alternative fuels;•the volatility in the market price of biofuel credits (primarily Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) needed to comply with the U.S. federal Renewable Fuel Standard);•delay of, cancellation of, or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects;•earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil, grain and other feedstocks, and refined products and ethanol;•rulings, judgments, or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs, in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage;•legislative or regulatory action, including the introduction or enactment of legislation or rulemakings by governmental authorities, including tax and environmental regulations, such as those implemented under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (also known as AB 32), Quebec’s Regulation respecting the cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emission allowances (the Quebec cap-and-trade system), and the U.S. EPA’s regulation of greenhouse gases, which may adversely affect our business or operations;•changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and trade credit;•changes in currency exchange rates, including the value of the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling, and the euro relative to the U.S. dollar; •overall economic conditions, including the stability and liquidity of financial markets; and•other factors generally described in the “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this report.Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so.All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 24OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOKOverviewFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of $3.7 billion, or $6.97 per share (assuming dilution), compared to $2.7 billion, or $4.96 per share (assuming dilution), for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase of $980 million was due primarily to the increase of $1.9 billion in our operating income as shown in the table below. The increase in our operating income was partially offset by a $325 million nontaxable gain recorded in 2013 related to the disposition of our retained interest in CST, which is more fully described in Notes 3 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our operating income increased $1.9 billion from 2013 to 2014 as outlined by business segment in the following table (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 ChangeOperating income (loss) by business segment: Refining $5,884 $4,211 $1,673Ethanol 786 491 295Retail — 81 (81)Corporate (768) (826) 58Total $5,902 $3,957 $1,945The $1.7 billion increase in refining segment operating income for 2014 compared to 2013 was due to wider discounts for sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil, higher throughput volumes in our U.S. Gulf Coast region, and higher margins on other refined products (e.g., petroleum coke and sulfur), partially offset by weaker distillate margins. Higher energy costs and depreciation expense between the periods also impacted our refining segment income. Our ethanol segment operating income increased $295 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower corn feedstock costs and higher production volumes, partially offset by lower co-product prices and lower ethanol prices.On May 1, 2013, we completed the separation of our retail business, by spinning off CST as an independent public company. Therefore, we did not have any retail segment operations in 2014, resulting in the $81 million decrease in retail segment operating income in 2014 compared to 2013.Additional details and analysis of the changes in the operating income of our business segments and other components of net income attributable to Valero stockholders are provided below under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.” 25OutlookEnergy markets and margins were volatile during 2014, especially in the latter part of the year, and we expect them to continue to be volatile in the near to mid-term. Below is a summary of factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2015:•Discounts in the price of medium sour and heavy sour crude oils as compared to the price of Brent crude oil have widened since year end as producers of those crude oils have attempted to maintain market share in an oversupplied crude oil market.•Discounts in the price of North American sweet crude oils as compared to the price of Brent crude oil are expected to increase due to a build in U.S. crude oil inventories, driven primarily by (i) increasing imports of medium sour and heavy sour crude oils, (ii) seasonal planned refinery maintenance, and (iii) a crude oil market structure where the future price is higher than the current price of crude oil, which indicates that the crude oil market is oversupplied.•Refined product margins are expected to strengthen due to an increase in the demand for refined products and the impact on product inventories from refinery maintenance thus far in the first quarter of 2015.•Ethanol margins are expected to remain relatively low as long as gasoline prices remain low.•The market price of biofuel credits (primarily RINs) is expected to remain volatile during 2015.•The cost to implement certain provisions of the AB 32 cap-and-trade system and low carbon fuel standard in California and the Quebec cap-and-trade system may be significant; however, we expect to recover the majority of these costs from our customers.•A further decline in market prices of crude oil and refined products may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories.•The United Steelworkers union and the U.S. refining industry are currently in the process of collective bargaining and strikes have been called at 12 U.S. refineries. We have four refineries that could be targeted for a strike but none has been targeted at this time. Also note our disclosures in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” — Our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by our employees, as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators. 26RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market prices that directly impact our operations.

references on pages 27 through 31.(a)In May 2014, we abandoned our Aruba Refinery, except for the associated crude oil and refined products terminal assets that we continue to operate. As a result, the refinery’s results of operations have been presented as discontinued operations and the operating highlights for the refining segment and the U.S. Gulf Coast region exclude the Aruba Refinery for all years presented. This transaction is more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(b)On May 1, 2013, we completed the separation of our retail business. As a result and effective May 1, 2013, our results of operations no longer include those of CST, our former retail business. The nature and significance of our post-separation participation in the supply of motor fuel to CST represents a continuation of activities with CST for accounting purposes. As such, the historical results of operations related to CST have not been reported as discontinued operations in the statements of income. This transaction is more fully discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(c)Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.(d)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.(e)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. 31GeneralOperating revenues decreased $7.2 billion (or 5 percent) for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in refined product prices in all of our regions. Despite the decline in operating revenues, operating income increased $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due primarily to a $1.7 billion increase in refining segment operating income, a $295 million increase in ethanol segment operating income, and a $34 million decrease in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an $81 million decrease in retail segment operating income due to the spin-off of our retail business in 2013 as mentioned previously. The reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments and general and administrative expenses, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed below.RefiningRefining segment operating income increased $1.7 billion from $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to a $1.9 billion increase in refining margin, partially offset by a $190 million increase in operating expenses and a $31 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.Refining margin increased $1.9 billion (a $1.59 per barrel increase) in 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to the following:•Higher discounts on light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils - Because the market prices for refined products generally track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the discount in the price of some light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils compared to the price of Brent crude oil widened. For example, LLS crude oil processed in our U.S. Gulf Coast region, which is a light sweet crude oil, sold at a discount of $2.79 per barrel to Brent crude oil for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.41 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing a favorable increase of $2.38 per barrel. Another example is Maya crude oil, a sour crude oil, which sold at a discount of $13.73 per barrel to Brent crude oil during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a discount of $11.31 per barrel during the year ended December 31, 2013, representing a favorable increase of $2.42 per barrel. We estimate that the discounts for light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils that we processed during the year ended December 31, 2014 had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $680 million and $800 million, respectively.•Higher throughput volumes - Refining throughput volumes increased 83,000 BPD for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. We estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes had a positive impact on our refining margin of approximately $340 million.•Lower costs of biofuel credits - As more fully described in Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending obligations under various government and regulatory compliance programs, and the cost of these credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) decreased by $145 million from $517 million in 2013 to $372 million in 2014. This decrease was due primarily to a reduction in the market price of RINs between the two years.•Increase in other refinery products margins - We experienced an increase in the margins of other refinery products relative to Brent crude oil, such as petroleum coke and sulfur during 2014 compared to 2013. Margins for other refinery products were higher during 2014 due to the decrease in the cost of crude oils during the year compared to 2013. For example, the benchmark price of Brent crude oil was $99.57 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $108.74 for the year ended December 31, 322013. We estimate that the increase in other refinery products margins during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $430 million.•Decrease in distillate margins - We experienced a decrease in distillate margins in our U.S. Gulf Coast region primarily due to the decrease in refined product prices . For example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low sulfur diesel was $14.28 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $15.95 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing an unfavorable decrease of $1.67 per barrel. We estimate that the decline in distillate margins during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 had a negative impact to our refining margin of approximately $400 million.The increase of $190 million in operating expenses was primarily due to a $128 million increase in energy costs related to higher natural gas prices ($4.36 per MMBtu for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3.69 per MMBtu for the year ended December 31, 2013) and a $22 million increase in maintenance expense primarily related to higher levels of routine maintenance activities during the year ended December 31, 2014.The increase of $31 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to additional depreciation expense of $25 million associated with the new hydrocracker unit at our St. Charles Refinery that began operating in July 2013.EthanolEthanol segment operating income was $786 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $491 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The $295 million increase in operating income was due primarily to a $399 million increase in gross margin (a $0.29 per gallon increase), partially offset by a $100 million increase in operating expenses.Ethanol gross margin per gallon increased to $1.06 per gallon for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.77 per gallon for the year ended December 31, 2013 due primarily to the following:•Lower corn prices - Corn prices were lower in 2014 due to higher corn inventories in 2014 compared to 2013, which resulted from a higher yielding harvest in 2013 compared to the drought-stricken harvest of 2012. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade corn price was $4.16 per bushel in 2014 compared to $5.80 per bushel in 2013. The decrease in the price of corn that we processed during 2014 favorably impacted our ethanol margin by approximately $910 million.•Lower ethanol prices - Ethanol prices were lower in 2014 due to higher ethanol inventories resulting from higher industry run rates in 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease in crude oil and gasoline prices in 2014 also contributed to the decrease in ethanol prices. For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $2.37 per gallon in 2014 compared to $2.53 per gallon in 2013. The decrease in the price of ethanol per gallon during 2014 had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $260 million.•Lower co-product prices - The decrease in corn prices in 2014 had a negative effect on the prices we received for corn-related ethanol co-products, such as distillers grains and corn oil. The decrease in co-products prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $250 million. 33The $100 million increase in operating expenses during 2014 compared to 2013 was partially due to $22 million in operating expenses of the Mount Vernon plant acquired in March 2014. The remaining increase of $78 million was primarily due to increased energy costs and chemical costs. The increase in energy costs of $57 million was due primarily to the severe winter weather in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2014 that caused a significant increase in regional natural gas prices combined with higher use of natural gas due to the increase in production volumes. The increase in chemical costs of $16 million was due to higher production volumes.Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $34 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to $30 million of transaction costs related to the separation of our retail business on May 1, 2013 that were recorded in 2013 and did not recur.Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $24 million primarily due to a $20 million loss on the sale of certain corporate property in 2013 that was reflected in depreciation and amortization expense.“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $32 million from the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily due to a $48 million decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of several large capital projects during 2013, including the new hydrocracker at our St. Charles Refinery, partially offset by a $20 million favorable impact from a decrease in average borrowings.Income tax expense increased $523 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to higher income from continuing operations before income tax expense. The effective rate for both years is lower than the U.S. statutory rate because income from continuing operations from our international operations was taxed at statutory rates that were lower than in the U.S. and due to a higher benefit from our U.S. manufacturing deduction.Income (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes expenses of $59 million for an asset retirement obligation and $4 million for certain contractual obligations associated with our decision in May 2014 to abandon the Aruba Refinery, as further described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 342013 Compared to 2012Financial Highlights (a)(millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2013 (b) 2012 ChangeOperating revenues$138,074 $138,393 $(319)Costs and expenses: Cost of sales127,316 126,485 831Operating expenses: Refining3,710 3,513 197Retail226 686 (460)Ethanol387 332 55General and administrative expenses758 698 60Depreciation and amortization expense: Refining1,566 1,345 221Retail41 119 (78)Ethanol45 42 3Corporate68 43 25Asset impairment losses (c)— 86 (86)Total costs and expenses134,117 133,349 768Operating income3,957 5,044 (1,087)Gain on disposition of retained interest in CST Brands, Inc.

2014, we abandoned our Aruba Refinery, except for the associated crude oil and refined products terminal assets that we continue to operate. As a result, the refinery’s results of operations have been presented as discontinued operations and the operating highlights for the refining segment and the U.S. Gulf Coast region exclude the Aruba Refinery for all years presented.This transaction is more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(b)On May 1, 2013, we completed the separation of our retail business. As a result and effective May 1, 2013, our results of operations no longer include those of CST, our former retail business. The nature and significance of our post-separation participation in the supply of motor fuel to CST represents a continuation of activities with CST for accounting purposes. As such, the historical results of operations related to CST have not been reported as discontinued operations in the statements of income. This transaction is more fully discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(c)Asset impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2012 include asset impairment losses of $65 million ($42 million after taxes) related to equipment associated with permanently cancelled capital project at several of our refineries and $21 million ($13 million after taxes) related to certain retail stores in 2012 that we owned prior to the separation of our retail business. The total asset impairment losses of $86 million are reflected in the operating income of the respective segments for the year ended December 31, 2012, but the asset impairment losses associated with the cancelled capital projects are excluded from the operating costs per barrel and operating income per barrel for the refining segment and the U.S. Gulf Coast region.(d)U.S. Mid-Continent product specifications for gasoline changed on September 16, 2013 from Conventional 87 to CBOB gasoline. Therefore, average market reference prices for comparable products meeting the new specifications required in this region are now being provided for all years presented.(e)Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.(f)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.(g)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; 39the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S.West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.GeneralOperating revenues decreased $319 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of lower average refined product prices between the two years related to our refining segment operations. In addition, operating income decreased $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to a $1.3 billion decrease in refining segment operating income, a $267 million decrease in retail segment operating income, and a $60 million increase in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $538 million increase in ethanol segment operating income. The reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments and general and administrative expenses, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed below.RefiningRefining segment operating income decreased $1.3 billion from $5.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 to $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in refining segment operating income was primarily due to an $855 million decrease in refining margin, a $221 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, and a $197 million increase in operating expenses.Refining margin decreased $855 million (a $1.31 per barrel decrease) in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the following:•Decrease in gasoline margins - We experienced a decline in gasoline margins throughout all of our regions during 2013 compared to 2012. For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent CBOB gasoline was $16.77 per barrel during 2013 compared to $25.40 per barrel during 2012, representing an unfavorable decrease of $8.63 per barrel. We estimate that the decline in gasoline margins per barrel during 2013 compared to 2012 had a negative impact to our refining margin of approximately $790 million for all refining regions.•Lower discounts on WTI-type crude oils in the U.S. Mid-Continent region - Because the market for refined products generally tracks the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. In 2013, the discount in the price of WTI compared to the price of Brent crude oil narrowed compared to 2012. WTI crude oil sold at a discount of $10.80 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2013 compared to a discount of $17.55 per barrel in 2012, representing an unfavorable decrease of $6.75 per barrel. Therefore, the lower discount on WTI-type crude oils that we processed negatively impacted our refining margin. We estimate that the decrease in the discounts for WTI-type crude oils that we processed during 2013 reduced our refining margin by approximately $640 million.•Higher costs of biofuel credits - As more fully described in Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we must purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending obligation under various government and regulatory compliance programs, and the cost of these credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) increased by $267 million from $250 million in 2012 to $517 million in 2013. This increase was due to an increase in the market price of RINs caused by an expectation in the market of a shortage in available RINs. 40•Increase in distillate margins - Despite lower distillate prices throughout all of our regions during 2013 compared to 2012, we experienced an increase in distillate margins during 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of increased production volumes of distillate between the years. This production volume increase of 75,000 barrels per day was primarily due to the start up of our new hydrocracker units at our Port Arthur and St. Charles Refineries, resulting in a $370 million increase in our refining margin in 2013.•Higher discounts on medium sour crude oils - In 2013, the discount in the price of medium sour crude oils compared to the price of Brent crude oil widened. For example, Mars crude oil, which is a medium sour crude oil, sold at a discount of $5.52 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2013 compared to a discount of $3.97 per barrel during 2012, representing a favorable increase of $1.55 per barrel. Therefore, the higher discounts on the medium sour crude oils we processed favorably impacted our refining margin. We estimate that the increase in the discounts for medium sour crude oils that we processed during 2013 had a favorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $260 million.The increase of $197 million in operating expenses was primarily due to a $185 million increase in energy costs related to higher natural gas costs and higher use of natural gas associated with our new hydrocracker units at our Port Arthur and St. Charles Refineries. The increase of $221 million in depreciation and amortization expense was due to additional depreciation expense primarily associated with our new hydrocracker units at our Port Arthur and St. Charles Refineries that began operating in late 2012 and the third quarter of 2013, respectively, and an increase in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization.RetailRetail segment operating income was $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $348 million for the year December 31, 2012. The $267 million decrease was primarily due to the separation of our retail business on May 1, 2013, which is more fully described in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of the separation, retail segment operating income for 2013 reflects the operations of our former retail business for only the first four months of 2013.EthanolEthanol segment operating income was $491 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to an operating loss of $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The $538 million increase in operating income was primarily due to a $596 million increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $55 million increase in operating expenses.Ethanol gross margin per gallon increased $0.47 per gallon from $0.30 per gallon in 2012 to $0.77 per gallon in 2013 due to the following:•Lower corn prices - Corn prices were lower in 2013 as many of the corn-producing regions of the U.S. Mid-Continent recovered from a drought that began in the second quarter of 2012. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade corn price was $5.80 per bushel in 2013 compared to $6.94 per bushel in 2012. The decrease in the price of corn that we processed during 2013 favorably impacted our ethanol margin by approximately $290 million.•Higher ethanol prices - Ethanol prices were higher in 2013 due to a decrease in the supply of ethanol in the market. The decrease in supply resulted from reduced production in 2012 and early 2013 as the industry responded to a narrowing of ethanol gross margin per gallon, which was due to higher corn prices primarily caused by the drought in the corn-producing regions of the U.S. Mid-Continent 41described above. By mid-2013, ethanol inventory levels in the U.S. had declined to their lowest level in over three years and as a result, prices increased significantly beginning late in the first quarter of 2013. For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $2.53 per gallon in 2013 compared to $2.37 per gallon in 2012. The increase in the price of ethanol per gallon during 2013 had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $160 million.•Increased production volumes - Ethanol margin also improved due to increased production volumes between the years of 327,000 gallons per day in 2013 compared to 2012 in response to the improved ethanol gross margin per gallon. The increase in production volumes during 2013 had a favorable impact to our ethanol gross margin of approximately $85 million.The $55 million increase in operating expenses during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a $40 million increase in energy costs compared to 2012 resulting from higher natural gas prices during 2013 and a $12 million year over year increase in chemical costs due to higher production.Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses increased $60 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to $52 million of environmental and legal reserve adjustments that were recorded during 2013 and $30 million for transaction costs related to the separation of our retail business on May 1, 2013. These increases were partially offset by an $11 million reduction in insurance reserves during 2013. The increase in corporate depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to $20 million of losses incurred on the sale of certain corporate property.During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a nontaxable gain of $325 million, or $0.60 per share, related to the disposition of our retained interest in CST, which is more fully described in Notes 3 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $51 million from the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to a $102 million decrease in capitalized interest due to completion of several large capital projects, including the new hydrocrackers at our Port Arthur and St. Charles Refineries, offset by a $44 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings and a $12 million write-off of unamortized debt discounts related to the early redemption of certain industrial revenue bonds in the first quarter of 2012.Income tax expense decreased $372 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2013. The variation in the customary relationship between income tax expense and income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to the nontaxable gain on the disposition of our retained interest in CST.Loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 represents the results of operations of the Aruba Refinery, which was abandoned in May 2014, including an asset impairment loss of $928 million as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2014Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $4.2 billion compared to $5.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a $2.7 billion unfavorable effect from changes in working capital between the periods partially offset by the increase in income from continuing operations discussed above under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.” The changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014, along with$603 million from available cash on hand, was used mainly to:•fund $2.8 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;•make a scheduled long-term note repayment of $200 million;•purchase common stock for treasury of $1.3 billion; and•pay common stock dividends of $554 million.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2013Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $5.6 billion compared to $5.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2013 combined with $735 million of net cash received in connection with the separation of our retail business (consisting of $550 million of proceeds on short-term debt, a $500 million cash distribution from CST less $315 million of cash retained by CST), and $525 million of proceeds on short-term debt related to the disposition of our retained interest in CST were used mainly to:•fund $2.8 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;•make scheduled long-term note repayments of $480 million;•make a short-term debt repayment of $58 million;•purchase common stock for treasury of $928 million;•pay common stock dividends of $462 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $2.2 billion.In addition, VLP completed its initial public offering of common units for net proceeds of $369 million. Because we consolidate VLP’s financial statements, the total cash reported by us also increased by these net proceeds; however, such proceeds can only be used by VLP for its purposes.Capital InvestmentsOur operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are improved continuously. The cost of improvements, which consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, can be significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors. 43Table of ContentsWe make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly.For 2015, we expect to incur approximately $1.95 billion for capital expenditures and approximately $700 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to potential strategic acquisitions and joint venture arrangements. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.We hold an option until January 2016 to purchase a 50 percent interest in the Diamond Pipeline project, a 440-mile, 20-inch crude oil pipeline that is projected to provide capacity of up to 200,000 BPD of domestic sweet crude oil from the Plains Cushing, Oklahoma terminal to our Memphis Refinery. The Diamond Pipeline project is currently being constructed by a third party for an estimated $900 million and is expected to be completed in 2017.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 are summarized below (in millions).

In December 2014, the actual availability under the facility fell below the facility borrowing capacity to $1.4 billion primarily due to a decline in eligible trade receivables as a result of a decrease in the latter part of 2014 in the market prices of the finished products that we produce. As of December 31, 2014, the amount of eligible receivables sold was $100 million. All amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt. 44Table of ContentsOur debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. All of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows:Rating Agency RatingMoody’s Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook)Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook)Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook)We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.Operating Lease ObligationsOur operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks, refined products, and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. Purchase obligations decreased from 2013 to 2014 primarily because of a decline in crude oil and refined product prices.Other Long-term LiabilitiesOur other long-term liabilities are described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2014. 45Table of ContentsOther Commercial CommitmentsAs of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding letters of credit under our committed lines of credit as follows (in millions): BorrowingCapacity Expiration OutstandingLetters of CreditLetter of credit facilities $550 June 2015 $56Revolver $3,000 November 2018 $54VLP Revolver $300 December 2018 $—Canadian Revolver C$50 November 2015 C$10As of December 31, 2014, we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities. The letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2014 expire in 2015 through 2017.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Purchase ProgramsAs of December 31, 2014, we have approvals under our $3 billion common stock purchase program to purchase approximately $1.5 billion of our common stock, but we have no obligation to make purchases under this program. Year to date through February 20, 2015, we have purchased one million shares for $57 million under this stock purchase program.Pension Plan FundingWe plan to contribute approximately $47 million to our pension plans and $20 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2015.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future as previously discussed above in “OUTLOOK.” In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Notes 10 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters.Tax MattersDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid $1.6 billion in income taxes, of which $400 million related to 2013 that was recorded in income taxes payable as of December 31, 2013. The payments made for the year ended December 31, 2014 exceeded income taxes paid for 2013 by $800 million. The increase in income taxes paid in 2014 is due in part to higher income from continuing operations before income tax expense. Although the amount of cash required to pay our 2014 income taxes increased compared to recent years, we generated and expect to continue generating sufficient cash from operations to make our tax payments as they become due. 46Table of ContentsThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal tax returns from 2004 through 2011, and we have received Revenue Agent Reports (RARs) in connection with the audits for tax years 2004 through 2009. We are vigorously contesting certain tax positions and assertions included in the RARs and continue to make significant progress in resolving certain of these matters with the IRS. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we settled the audit related to our 2002 and 2003 tax years and the audit related to a group of our subsidiaries for their 2004 and 2005 tax years consistent with the recorded amounts of uncertain tax position liabilities associated with those audits. In addition, we expect to settle our audits for tax years 2004 through 2007 within the next 12 months and we believe they will be settled for amounts that do not exceed the recorded amounts of uncertain tax position liabilities associated with those audits. As a result, we have classified a portion of our uncertain tax position liabilities as a current liability. As of December 31, 2014, the total amount of uncertain tax position liabilities, including related penalties and interest, was $484 million, with $168 million reflected as a current liability in income taxes payable and $316 million reflected in other long-term liabilities. Should we ultimately settle for amounts consistent with our estimates, we believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand at that time to make such payments.Cash Held by Our International SubsidiariesWe operate in countries outside the U.S. through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries, and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the U.S. in the form of cash dividends. Should we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated. In addition, such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations, as further discussed in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe, however, that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the U.S. without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings. As of December 31, 2014, $738 million of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries.Emissions Allowances and Cap-and-TradeThe cost to implement certain provisions of the AB 32 cap-and-trade system and low carbon fuel standard in California and the Quebec cap-and-trade system may be significant; however, we expect to recover the majority of these costs from our customers.Concentration of CustomersOur refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.Sources of LiquidityWe believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. 47Table of ContentsNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAs discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will become effective for our financial statements in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements, except as otherwise disclosed.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable.Property, Plant, and EquipmentDepreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation. We maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries. We estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group, and such evaluations consist of, but are not limited to, the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition, consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained, assessment of the need to replace assets, and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group. The estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years.Under the composite method of depreciation, the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life. We design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications, design standards, and practices accepted in our industry, and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives. Therefore, we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group. It should be noted, however, that factors such as competition, regulation, or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting depreciation expense in the future.Impairment of AssetsLong-lived assets (which include property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and deferred refinery turnaround and catalyst costs) and equity method investments are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.In order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Our 48Table of Contentsimpairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. See Notes 2 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from those analyses.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes.The amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 is included in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49Table of ContentsPension and Other Postretirement Benefit ObligationsWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates, and these assumptions are disclosed and described in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we utilized a forward-looking model of asset returns. The historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to December 31, 2014 was 7.71 percent. The actual return on assets for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 7.33 percent, 19.38 percent, and 11.84 percent, respectively. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements. For example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2015 (in millions): Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefitsIncrease in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease$105 $12Compensation rate increase7 n/aHealth care cost trend rate increasen/a 1 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease10 —Expected return on plan assets decrease5 n/aCompensation rate increase2 n/aHealth care cost trend rate increasen/a —See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.Tax MattersWe record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to an indirect tax (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and/or value-added tax) claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates 50Table of Contentsor our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. See Notes 12 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities.Legal MattersA variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. 51Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to hedge:•inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels and•forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable.We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows.Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): Derivative Instruments Held For Non-Trading Purposes TradingPurposesDecember 31, 2014: Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices$(127) $(2)10% decrease in underlying commodity prices126 7 December 31, 2013: Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices(91) 310% decrease in underlying commodity prices91 (2)See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2014. 52Table of ContentsCOMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs. To manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. As of December 31, 2014, there was no gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs.INTEREST RATE RISKThe following table provides information about our debt instruments, excluding capital lease obligations (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” included in this report.CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995This report, including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK,” includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “projection,” “predict,” “budget,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “target,” “could,” “should,” “may,” and similar expressions.These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding:•future refining margins, including gasoline and distillate margins;•future ethanol margins;•expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil differentials, and operating expenses;•anticipated levels of crude oil and refined product inventories;•our anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred costs for refinery turnarounds and catalyst, capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and joint venture investments, and the effect of those capital investments on our results of operations;•anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products in the regions where we operate, as well as globally;•expectations regarding environmental, tax, and other regulatory initiatives; and•the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining and ethanol industry fundamentals.We based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following:•acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined products or receive feedstocks;•political and economic conditions in nations that produce crude oil or consume refined products;•demand for, and supplies of, refined products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, and ethanol;•demand for, and supplies of, crude oil and other feedstocks;•the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls;•the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations;•refinery overcapacity or undercapacity;•our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations;24Table of Contents•the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and adjustments to refining capacity in response to market conditions;•the level of competitors’ imports into markets that we supply;•accidents, unscheduled shutdowns, or other catastrophes affecting our refineries, machinery, pipelines, equipment, and information systems, or those of our suppliers or customers;•changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined products;•the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles;•the levels of government subsidies for alternative fuels;•the volatility in the market price of biofuel credits (primarily Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) needed to comply with the U.S. federal Renewable Fuel Standard) and GHG emission credits needed to comply with the requirements of various GHG emission programs;•delay of, cancellation of, or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects;•earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil, grain and other feedstocks, and refined products and ethanol;•rulings, judgments, or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs, in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage;•legislative or regulatory action, including the introduction or enactment of legislation or rulemakings by governmental authorities, including tax and environmental regulations, such as those implemented under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (also known as AB 32), Quebec’s Regulation respecting the cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emission allowances (the Quebec cap-and-trade system), and the U.S. EPA’s regulation of GHGs, which may adversely affect our business or operations;•changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and trade credit;•changes in currency exchange rates, including the value of the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling, and the euro relative to the U.S. dollar;•overall economic conditions, including the stability and liquidity of financial markets; and•other factors generally described in the “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this report.Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so.All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.25Table of ContentsOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOKOverviewFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of $4.0 billion, or $7.99 per share (assuming dilution), compared to $3.7 billion, or $6.97 per share (assuming dilution), for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in our 2015 results was a noncash charge for a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment recorded in December 2015 of $790 million ($624 million after taxes, or $1.25 per share (assuming dilution)), of which $740 million was attributable to our refining segment and $50 million was attributable to our ethanol segment. This matter is more fully described in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in our 2014 results was a last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory gain of $233 million ($151 million after taxes, or $0.29 per share (assuming dilution)) primarily related to our refining segment.Our operating income increased $456 million from 2014 to 2015 as outlined by business segment in the following table (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 ChangeOperating income (loss) by business segment: Refining $6,973 $5,884 $1,089Ethanol 142 786 (644)Corporate (757) (768) 11Total $6,358 $5,902 $456However, excluding the effect of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and the LIFO gain discussed above, total operating income for 2015 and 2014 was $7.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, reflecting a $1.4 billion favorable increase between the years, with refining segment operating income of $7.7 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, (a favorable increase of $2.1 billion) and ethanol segment operating income of $192 million and $782 million, (an unfavorable decrease of $590 million).The $2.1 billion increase in refining segment operating income in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to higher margins on gasoline and other refined products (e.g., petroleum coke, propane, sulfur, and lubes), partially offset by lower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil and lower distillate margins. Our ethanol segment operating income decreased $590 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower ethanol margins that resulted from lower ethanol and co-product prices, partially offset by lower corn feedstock costs.Additional details and analysis of the changes in the operating income of our business segments and other components of net income attributable to Valero stockholders are provided below under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.”In March 2015, we issued $600 million of 3.65 percent senior notes due March 15, 2025 and $650 million of 4.9 percent senior notes due March 15, 2045, and our consolidated subsidiary, VLP, borrowed $200 million under its revolving credit facility (the VLP Revolver), as further described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On July 1, 2015, VLP repaid $25 million of the amount borrowed under the VLP Revolver.26Table of ContentsOn July 13, 2015, our board of directors authorized us to purchase an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common stock, with no expiration date to such authorization, and we had $1.3 billion remaining available under that authorization as of December 31, 2015.Effective November 24, 2015, VLP completed a public offering of 4,250,000 common units at a price of $46.25 per unit and received net proceeds from the offering of $189 million after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering costs. This transaction is further described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.OutlookEnergy markets and margins were volatile during 2015, and we expect them to continue to be volatile in the 2016. Below is a summary of factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2016:•Gasoline margins have been volatile, but are expected to recover from seasonal lows in the near term as domestic and export demand is expected to increase. Distillate margins have been negatively impacted by mild winter temperatures and are also expected to recover from their seasonal lows.•Medium and heavy sour crude oil discounts are expected to remain wide as sour crude oil remains oversupplied. Fuel oil price weakness has also put pressure on heavy sour crude oil discounts. Sweet crude oil discounts are expected to remain weak on lower domestic sweet crude oil production and higher foreign sweet and sour crude oil imports.•Ethanol margins are expected to remain depressed as long as gasoline prices remain low.•A further decline in market prices of crude oil and refined products may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories.27Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market prices that directly impact our operations.

pages 28 through 32.(a)Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects a LIFO gain of $233 million ($151 million after taxes), of which $229 million is attributable to our refining segment and $4 million is attributable to our ethanol segment. These amounts have been excluded from (1) the segment and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts for the refining segment, and (2) the operating income and gross margin per gallon of production amounts for the ethanol segment.(b)In December 2015, we recorded a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment of $790 million ($624 million after taxes), of which $740 million is attributable to our refining segment and $50 million is attributable to our ethanol segment. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost is primarily determined using the LIFO inventory valuation methodology, whereby the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales in the statement of income and inventories are valued at base layer acquisition costs in the balance sheet. Market is determined based on an assessment of the net realizable value of our inventory. In periods where the market price of our inventory falls below cost, we record an inventory valuation adjustment to write down the value to market in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015 has been excluded from (1) the segment and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts for the refining segment, and (2) the gross operating income and the gross margin per gallon of production amounts for the ethanol segment. This adjustment is further discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(c)The LIFO gain of $233 million recorded in 2014 (see note (a)) and the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment of $790 million recorded in 2015 (see note (b)) are reflected in refining operating income and ethanol operating income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, but are excluded from throughput margin per barrel and operating income per barrel for the refining segment, and from gross margin per gallon and operating income per gallon for the ethanol segment, respectively, as also described in notes (a) and (b).(d)Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.(e)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.32Table of Contents(f)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.GeneralOperating revenues decreased $43.0 billion (or 33 percent) and cost of sales decreased $44.3 billion (or 37 percent) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in refined product prices and crude oil feedstock costs, respectively. Despite the decrease in operating revenues, cost of sales decreased to a greater extent resulting in an increase in operating income of $456 million in 2015, with refining segment operating income increasing by $1.1 billion and ethanol segment operating income decreasing by $644 million. The reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments and corporate expenses, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed below.RefiningRefining segment operating income increased $1.1 billion from $5.9 billion in 2014 to $7.0 billion in 2015. Excluding the effect of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment of $740 million in 2015 and the LIFO gain of $229 million in 2014, our refining segment operating income increased $2.1 billion. This increase was primarily due to a $2.1 billion (or $1.92 per barrel) increase in refining margin and a $105 million decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by a $148 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.The increase in refining margin of $2.1 billion was due primarily to the following:•Increase in gasoline margins - We experienced an increase in gasoline margins throughout all our regions during 2015. For example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast CBOB gasoline was $9.83 per barrel in 2015 compared to $3.54 per barrel in 2014, a favorable increase of $6.29 per barrel. Another example is the ANS-based reference margin for U.S. West Coast CARBOB gasoline that was $25.56 per barrel in 2015 compared to $13.40 per barrel in 2014, a favorable increase of $12.16 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in gasoline margins per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $2.9 billion.•Increase in other refined products margins - We experienced an increase in the margins of other refined products such as petroleum coke, propane, sulfur, and lubes in 2015 compared to 2014. Margins for other refined products were higher during 2015 due to the lower cost of crude oils in 2015 compared to 2014. Because the market prices for our other refined products remain relatively stable, we benefit when the cost of crude oils that we process declines. For example, the benchmark price of Brent crude oil was $53.62 per barrel in 2015 compared to $99.57 per barrel in 2014. We estimate that the increase in margins for other refined products in 2015 compared to 2014 had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $1.6 billion.•Lower discounts on light sweet and sour crude oils - Because the market prices for refined products generally track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. For 2015, the discount in the price of light sweet and sour crude oils compared to the price of Brent crude oil narrowed. Therefore, while we benefitted from processing crude oils priced at a discount to Brent crude oil, that benefit declined in 2015 compared to 2014. For example, we processed LLS crude oil (a type of light sweet crude oil) in our U.S. Gulf Coast region that sold at a discount of $2.37 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2015 compared 33Table of Contentsto $2.79 per barrel in 2014, representing an unfavorable decrease of $0.42 per barrel. Another example is Maya crude oil (a type of sour crude oil) that sold at a discount of $9.54 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2015 compared to a discount of $13.73 per barrel in 2014, representing an unfavorable decrease of $4.19 per barrel. We estimate that the narrowing of the discounts for sweet crude oils and sour crude oils that we processed during 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $260 million and $770 million, respectively.•Lower benefit from processing other feedstocks - In addition to crude oil, we use other feedstocks and blendstocks in our refining processes, such as natural gas. When combined with steam, natural gas produces hydrogen that is used in our hydrotreater and hydrocracker processing units to produce refined products. Although natural gas costs declined from 2014 to 2015, the decline was not as significant as the decline in the cost of Brent crude oil; therefore, the benefit we normally derive by using natural gas as a feedstock declined. We estimate that the decline in the benefit we derived from processing other feedstocks had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $980 million in 2015 compared to 2014.•Decrease in distillate margins - We experienced a decrease in distillate margins throughout all our regions during 2015. For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low-sulfur diesel (a type of distillate) was $19.02 per barrel in 2015 compared to $24.05 per barrel in 2014, an unfavorable decrease of $5.03 per barrel. Another example is the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel that was $12.64 per barrel in 2015 compared to $14.28 per barrel in 2014, an unfavorable decrease of $1.64 per barrel. We estimate that the decrease in distillate margins per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $650 million.•Higher throughput volumes - Refining throughput volumes increased by 34,000 BPD in 2015. We estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $160 million in 2015.The decrease of $105 million in operating expenses was primarily due to a $196 million decrease in energy costs driven by lower natural gas prices ($2.58 per MMBtu in 2015 compared to $4.36 per MMBtu in 2014). This decrease in energy costs was partially offset by a $47 million increase in employee-related expenses primarily due to higher employee benefit costs and incentive compensation expenses, and a $26 million increase in costs associated with higher levels of maintenance activities in 2015.The increase of $148 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily associated with the impact of new capital projects that began operating in 2015 and higher refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization.EthanolEthanol segment operating income was $142 million in 2015 compared to $786 million in 2014. Excluding the effect of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment of $50 million in 2015 and the LIFO gain of $4 million in 2014, our ethanol segment operating income decreased $590 million. This decrease was primarily due to a $628 million (or $0.57 per gallon) decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a $39 million decrease in operating expenses.The decrease in ethanol gross margin of $628 million was due primarily to the following:•Lower ethanol prices - Ethanol prices were lower in 2015 primarily due to the decrease in crude oil and gasoline prices in 2015 compared to 2014. For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $1.59 per 34Table of Contentsgallon in 2015 compared to $2.37 per gallon in 2014. We estimate that the decrease in the price of ethanol per gallon during 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $800 million.•Lower corn prices - Corn prices were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a higher domestic corn yield realized during the 2014 fall harvest (most of which is processed in the following year). For example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) corn price was $3.77 per bushel in 2015 compared to $4.16 per bushel in 2014. We estimate that the decrease in the price of corn that we processed during 2015 had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $160 million.•Lower co-product prices - The decrease in corn prices in 2015 compared to 2014 had a negative effect on the prices we received for corn-related ethanol co-products, such as distillers grains and corn oil. We estimate that the decrease in co-product prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $40 million.•Increased production volumes - Ethanol margin was favorably impacted by increased production volumes of 405,000 gallons per day in 2015. Production volumes in 2014 were negatively impacted by weather-related rail disruptions. In addition, production volumes in 2015 were positively impacted by production volumes from our Mount Vernon plant, which began operations in August 2014. We estimate that the increase in production volumes had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $50 million.The $39 million decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a $40 million decrease in energy costs related to lower natural gas prices ($2.58 per MMBtu in 2015 compared to $4.36 per MMBtu in 2014).Other“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” increased by $36 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to the impact from $1.25 billion of debt issued by Valero and $200 million borrowed by VLP under the VLP Revolver in 2015.Income tax expense increased $93 million in 2015. This increase was lower than expected given the increase in income from continuing operations of $419 million and was due primarily to earnings from our international operations that are taxed at statutory tax rates that are lower than in the U.S. In addition, in 2015, the U.K. statutory rate was lowered and we favorably settled various U.S. income tax audits.The loss from discontinued operations in 2014 includes expenses of $64 million primarily related to an asset retirement obligation associated with our decision in May 2014 to abandon the Aruba Refinery, as further described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.35Table of Contents2014 Compared to 2013Financial Highlights (a)(millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 (c) ChangeOperating revenues$130,844 $138,074 $(7,230)Costs and expenses: Cost of sales (b)118,141 127,316 (9,175)Operating expenses: Refining3,900 3,710 190Retail— 226 (226)Ethanol487 387 100General and administrative expenses724 758 (34)Depreciation and amortization expense: Refining1,597 1,566 31Retail— 41 (41)Ethanol49 45 4Corporate44 68 (24)Total costs and expenses124,942 134,117 (9,175)Operating income5,902 3,957 1,945Gain on disposition of retained interest in CST Brands, Inc.

except for the associated crude oil and refined products terminal assets that we continue to operate. As a result, the refinery’s results of operations have been presented as discontinued operations and the operating highlights for the refining segment and the U.S. Gulf Coast region exclude the Aruba Refinery for all years presented.This transaction is more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(b)Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects a LIFO gain of $233 million ($151 million after taxes), of which $229 million is attributable to our refining segment and $4 million is attributable to our ethanol segment. These amounts have been excluded from (1) the segment and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts for the refining segment, and (2) the operating income and gross margin per gallon of production amounts for the ethanol segment.(c)On May 1, 2013, we completed the separation of our retail business. As a result and effective May 1, 2013, our results of operations no longer include those of CST, our former retail business. The nature and significance of our post-separation participation in the supply of motor fuel to CST represents a continuation of activities with CST for accounting purposes. As such, the historical results of operations related to CST have not been reported as discontinued operations in the statements of income. This transaction is more fully discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(d)The LIFO gain of $233 million recorded in 2014 (see note (b)) is reflected in refining operating income and ethanol operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014, but is excluded from throughput margin per barrel and operating income per barrel for the refining segment, and from gross margin per gallon and operating income per gallon for the ethanol segment, respectively, as also described in note (b).(e)Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.(f)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.40Table of Contents(g)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.GeneralOperating revenues decreased $7.2 billion (or 5 percent) for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in refined product prices in all of our regions. Despite the decline in operating revenues, operating income increased $1.9 billion in 2014 due primarily to a $1.7 billion increase in refining segment operating income, a $295 million increase in ethanol segment operating income, and a $34 million decrease in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an $81 million decrease in retail segment operating income due to the spin-off of our retail business in 2013 as mentioned previously. The reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments and general and administrative expenses, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed below.RefiningRefining segment operating income increased $1.7 billion from $4.2 billion in 2013 to $5.9 billion in 2014. Excluding the LIFO gain of $229 million in 2014 related to our refining segment, our refining segment operating income increased by $1.4 billion. This increase was primarily due to a $1.7 billion (or $1.36 per barrel) increase in refining margin, partially offset by a $190 million increase in operating expenses and a $31 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.The increase in refining margin of $1.7 billion was due primarily to the following:•Higher discounts on light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils - Because the market prices for refined products generally track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. For 2014, the discount in the price of some light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils compared to the price of Brent crude oil widened. For example, LLS crude oil processed in our U.S. Gulf Coast region, which is a light sweet crude oil, sold at a discount of $2.79 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2014 compared to $0.41 per barrel in 2013, representing a favorable increase of $2.38 per barrel. Another example is Maya crude oil, a sour crude oil, which sold at a discount of $13.73 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2014 compared to a discount of $11.31 per barrel in 2013, representing a favorable increase of $2.42 per barrel. We estimate that the discounts for light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils that we processed in 2014 had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $680 million and $800 million, respectively.•Higher throughput volumes - Refining throughput volumes increased 83,000 BPD in 2014. We estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes had a positive impact on our refining margin of approximately $340 million.•Lower costs of biofuel credits - As more fully described in Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending obligations under various government and regulatory compliance programs, and the cost of these credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) decreased by $145 million from $517 million in 2013 to $372 million in 2014. This decrease was due primarily to a reduction in the market price of RINs between the years.41Table of Contents•Increase in other refinery products margins - We experienced an increase in the margins of other refinery products relative to Brent crude oil, such as petroleum coke and sulfur during 2014 compared to 2013. Margins for other refinery products were higher during 2014 due to the decrease in the cost of crude oils during the year compared to 2013. For example, the benchmark price of Brent crude oil was $99.57 per barrel in 2014 compared to $108.74 in 2013. We estimate that the increase in other refinery products margins in 2014 had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $430 million.•Decrease in distillate margins - We experienced a decrease in distillate margins in our U.S. Gulf Coast region primarily due to the decrease in refined product prices . For example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low sulfur diesel was $14.28 per barrel in 2014 compared to $15.95 per barrel in 2013, representing an unfavorable decrease of $1.67 per barrel. We estimate that the decline in distillate margins in 2014 had a negative impact to our refining margin of approximately $400 million.The increase of $190 million in operating expenses was primarily due to a $128 million increase in energy costs related to higher natural gas prices ($4.36 per MMBtu in 2014 compared to $3.69 per MMBtu in 2013) and a $22 million increase in maintenance expense primarily related to higher levels of routine maintenance activities in 2014.The increase of $31 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to additional depreciation expense of $25 million associated with the new hydrocracker unit at our St. Charles Refinery that began operating in July 2013.EthanolEthanol segment operating income was $786 million in 2014 compared to $491 million in 2013. The $295 million increase in operating income was due primarily to a $399 million (or $0.29 per gallon) increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $100 million increase in operating expenses.The increase in ethanol gross margin of $399 million was due primarily to the following:•Lower corn prices - Corn prices were lower in 2014 due to higher corn inventories in 2014 compared to 2013, which resulted from a higher yielding harvest in 2013 compared to the drought-stricken harvest of 2012. For example, the CBOT corn price was $4.16 per bushel in 2014 compared to $5.80 per bushel in 2013. The decrease in the price of corn that we processed during 2014 favorably impacted our ethanol margin by approximately $910 million.•Lower ethanol prices - Ethanol prices were lower in 2014 due to higher ethanol inventories resulting from higher industry run rates in 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease in crude oil and gasoline prices in 2014 also contributed to the decrease in ethanol prices. For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $2.37 per gallon in 2014 compared to $2.53 per gallon in 2013. The decrease in the price of ethanol per gallon during 2014 had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $260 million.•Lower co-product prices - The decrease in corn prices in 2014 had a negative effect on the prices we received for corn-related ethanol co-products, such as distillers grains and corn oil. The decrease in co-products prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $250 million.42Table of ContentsThe $100 million increase in operating expenses in 2014 was partially due to $22 million in operating expenses of the Mount Vernon plant acquired in March 2014. The remaining increase of $78 million was primarily due to increased energy costs and chemical costs. The increase in energy costs of $57 million was due primarily to the severe winter weather in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2014 that caused a significant increase in regional natural gas prices combined with higher use of natural gas due to the increase in production volumes. The increase in chemical costs of $16 million was due to higher production volumes.Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $34 million in 2014 primarily due to $30 million of transaction costs in 2013 related to the separation of our retail business on May 1, 2013.Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $24 million primarily due to a $20 million loss on the sale of certain corporate property in 2013 that was reflected in depreciation and amortization expense.“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” increased $32 million in 2014. This increase was primarily due to a $48 million decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of several large capital projects during 2013, including the new hydrocracker at our St. Charles Refinery, partially offset by a $20 million favorable impact from a decrease in average borrowings.Income tax expense increased $523 million in 2014 due to higher income from continuing operations before income tax expense. The effective rate for both years is lower than the U.S. statutory rate because income from continuing operations from our international operations was taxed at statutory rates that were lower than in the U.S. and due to a higher benefit from our U.S. manufacturing deduction.Income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2014 includes expenses of $59 million for an asset retirement obligation and $4 million for certain contractual obligations associated with our decision in May 2014 to abandon the Aruba Refinery, as further described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.43Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2015Our operations generated $5.6 billion of cash in 2015, driven primarily by net income of $4.1 billion and excluding $2.6 billion of noncash charges to income ($1.8 billion for depreciation and amortization expense and $790 million for a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment). See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. However, the change in working capital during the year had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of $1.3 billion. This use of cash was composed primarily of (i) a decrease in accounts payable, net of a decrease in receivables, of $493 million, (ii) an increase in income taxes receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable totaling $432 million, and (iii) an increase in inventories of $222 million as shown in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The unfavorable effect of accounts payable, net of accounts receivable, was mainly due to a decrease in commodity prices from December 2014 to December 2015. The unfavorable effect in income taxes was due to tax payments associated with the settlement of several IRS audits and an overpayment of taxes in 2015. This overpayment resulted from a change in the U.S. Federal tax laws late in the year that reinstated the bonus depreciation deduction, which lowered our current income tax expense. The unfavorable effect in inventories was mainly due to the build in inventory volumes in 2015 as we purchased crude oil at prices we deemed favorable during the fourth quarter of 2015.The $5.6 billion of cash generated by our operations in 2015, along with (i) $1.45 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt and (ii) net proceeds of $189 million from VLP’s public offering of 4,250,000 common units as discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, were used mainly to:•fund $2.5 billion of investing activities, including $2.4 billion in capital investments. Capital investments are comprised of capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and joint venture investments;•make payments on debt and capital lease obligations of $513 million, of which $400 million related to our 4.5 percent senior notes, $75 million related to our 8.75 percent debentures, $25 million related to the VLP Revolver, $10 million related to capital lease obligations, and $3 million related to other non-bank debt;•purchase common stock for treasury of $2.8 billion;•pay common stock dividends of $848 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $425 million.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2014Our operations generated $4.2 billion of cash in 2014, driven primarily by net income of $3.7 billion and excluding $1.7 billion of noncash charges to income (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. However, the change in our working capital during the year had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of $1.8 billion. This use of cash was composed primarily of a decrease in accounts receivable of $2.8 billion, which was offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $3.1 billion, a decrease in income taxes payable of $319 million, and an increase in inventories of $1.0 billion as shown in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The favorable effect in accounts receivable and the unfavorable effect in accounts payable were mainly due to a decrease in commodity prices from December 2013 to December 2014. The unfavorable effect associated with income taxes payable resulted from income tax payments exceeding income tax liabilities incurred in 2014 due to the payment of liabilities associated with prior period earnings. The unfavorable effect in inventories was mainly due to the build in inventory volumes from 2013 to 2014 as we purchased crude oil at prices we deemed favorable during the fourth quarter of 2014.44Table of ContentsThe $4.2 billion of cash provided by our operations in 2014, along with $603 million from available cash on hand, was used mainly to:•fund $2.8 billion of capital investments, which included capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;•make debt and capital lease obligations repayments of $204 million, of which $200 million related to our 4.75 percent senior notes, and $4 million related to capital lease obligations;•purchase common stock for treasury of $1.3 billion; and•pay common stock dividends of $554 million.Capital InvestmentsWe define capital investments as capital expenditures for additions to and improvements of our refining and ethanol segment assets (including turnaround and catalyst costs) and investments in joint ventures.Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are improved continuously. The cost of improvements, which consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, can be significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly.We hold investments in joint ventures and we invest in these joint ventures or enter into new joint venture arrangements to enhance our operations. In December 2015, we exercised our option to purchase a 50 percent interest in Diamond Pipeline LLC (Diamond Pipeline), which was formed by Plains Pipeline, L.P. (Plains) to construct and operate a 440-mile, 20-inch crude oil pipeline expected to provide capacity of up to 200,000 BPD of domestic sweet crude oil from the Plains Cushing, Oklahoma terminal to our Memphis Refinery, with the ability to connect into the Capline Pipeline. The pipeline is expected to be completed in 2017 for an estimated $925 million, pending receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. We contributed $136 million upon exercise of our option and expect to invest an additional $170 million in 2016.For 2016, we expect to incur approximately $2.6 billion for capital investments, including capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and joint venture investments. This consists of approximately $1.6 billion for stay-in-business capital and $1.0 billion for growth strategies, including our continued investment in Diamond Pipeline. This capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.45Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter TotalDebt and capitallease obligations (a)$134 $966 $16 $766 $1,039 $4,517 $7,438Operating lease obligations430 283 200 143 100 311 1,467Purchase obligations14,975 3,204 2,458 1,197 985 4,535 27,354Other long-term liabilities— 172 134 131 125 1,049 1,611Total$15,539 $4,625 $2,808 $2,237 $2,249 $10,412 $37,870______________________________(a)Debt obligations exclude amounts related to unamortized discount and fair value adjustments. Capital lease obligations include related interest expense. These items are further described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Debt and Capital Lease ObligationsWe have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis. In July 2015, we amended our agreement to decrease the facility from $1.5 billion to $1.4 billion and extended the maturity date to July 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the actual availability under the facility fell below the facility borrowing capacity to $1.1 billion primarily due to a decrease in eligible trade receivables as a result of the ongoing decline in the market prices of the finished products that we produce. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of eligible receivables sold was $100 million. All amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt.Our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. All of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows:Rating Agency RatingMoody’s Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook)Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook)Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook)We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.Operating Lease ObligationsOur operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks, refined products, and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or 46Table of Contentsremaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions.Other Long-term LiabilitiesOur other long-term liabilities are described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2015.Summary of Credit FacilitiesAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings and letters of credit issued under our credit facilities as follows (in millions): December 31, 2015 FacilityAmount Maturity Date Borrowings Letters ofCredit Available Committed facilities: Revolver $3,000 November 2020 $— $57 $2,943VLP Revolver $750 November 2020 $175 $— $575Canadian Revolver C$50 November 2016 C$— C$10 C$40Accounts receivable sales facility $1,400 July 2016 $100 $— $992Letter of credit facilities $275 June 2016 andNovember 2016 $— $9 $266 Uncommitted facilities: Letter of credit facilities $775 N/A $— $87 $688Letters of credit issued as of December 31, 2015 expire in 2016 through 2018.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.47Table of ContentsOther Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Purchase ProgramsOn July 13, 2015, our board of directors authorized us to purchase an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common stock with no expiration date to such authorization. This authorization was in addition to the remaining amount available under a $3 billion program previously authorized. During the third quarter of 2015, we completed our purchases under the $3 billion program. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.3 billion remaining available under the $2.5 billion program, but we have no obligation to make purchases under this program.Pension Plan FundingWe plan to contribute approximately $36 million to our pension plans and $20 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2016.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future as previously discussed above in “OUTLOOK.” In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Notes 9 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters.Tax MattersThe IRS has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal tax returns from 2008 through 2011, and we have received Revenue Agent Reports (RARs) in connection with the audits for tax years 2008 and 2009. We are contesting certain tax positions and assertions included in the RARs and continue to make progress in resolving certain of these matters with the IRS. During 2015, we settled the audits related to our 2004 through 2007 tax years consistent with the recorded amounts of uncertain tax position liabilities associated with those audits. In addition, we expect to settle our audit for tax years 2008 and 2009 within the next 12 months and we believe it will be settled for amounts consistent with the recorded amounts of uncertain tax position liabilities associated with that audit. As a result, we have classified a portion of our uncertain tax position liabilities as a current liability. Our net uncertain tax position liabilities, including related penalties and interest, was $391 million as of December 31, 2015. Should we ultimately settle for amounts consistent with our estimates, we believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand at that time to make such payments.Cash Held by Our International SubsidiariesWe operate in countries outside the U.S. through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries, and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the U.S. in the form of cash dividends. Should we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated. In addition, such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations, as further discussed in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe, however, that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the U.S. without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings. As of December 31, 2015, $1.7 billion of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries.48Table of ContentsEmissions Allowances and Cap-and-TradeThe cost to implement certain provisions of the AB 32 cap-and-trade system and low carbon fuel standard in California and the Quebec cap-and-trade system are significant; however, we are recovering the majority of these costs from our customers. If we are unable to recover these costs from our customers in the future, we believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand to cover these costs.Concentration of CustomersOur operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.Sources of LiquidityWe believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAs discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will become effective for our financial statements in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements, except as otherwise disclosed.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes.Lower of Cost or Market Inventory ValuationInventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally determined under the LIFO method using the dollar-value LIFO approach. Market value is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories.We compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis, excluding materials and supplies. In determining the market value of our inventories, we assume our refinery and ethanol feedstocks 49Table of Contentsare converted into refined products, which requires us to make estimates regarding the refined products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined products. We also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our refineries and ethanol plants to the appropriate points of sale. We then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories. If the aggregate market value is less than cost, we record a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment to reflect our inventories at market value.The lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015 is discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Property, Plant, and EquipmentDepreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation. We maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries. We estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group, and such evaluations consist of, but are not limited to, the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition, consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained, assessment of the need to replace assets, and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group. The estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years.Under the composite method of depreciation, the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life. We design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications, design standards, and practices accepted in our industry, and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives. Therefore, we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group. It should be noted, however, that factors such as competition, regulation, or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting depreciation expense in the future.Impairment of AssetsLong-lived assets and equity method investments are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.In order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.50Table of ContentsAccruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies.The amount of our accruals for environmental matters as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are included in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit ObligationsWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are disclosed and described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we utilized a forward-looking model of asset returns. The historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to December 31, 2015 was 5.69 percent. The actual return on assets for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was 1.46 percent, 7.33 percent, and 19.38 percent, respectively. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements. For example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2016 (in millions): Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefitsIncrease in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease$101 $11Compensation rate increase10 n/aHealth care cost trend rate increasen/a 1 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease9 —Expected return on plan assets decrease5 n/aCompensation rate increase3 n/aHealth care cost trend rate increasen/a —51Table of ContentsBeginning in 2016, our net periodic benefit cost will be determined using the spot-rate approach. Under this approach, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted by the spot rates of the corporate bond yield curve used to calculate our liability discount rate. If the yield curve were to flatten entirely and our liability discount rate remained unchanged, our net periodic benefit cost would increase by $19 million for pension benefits and $3 million for other postretirement benefits in 2016.See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.Tax MattersWe record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to an indirect tax (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and/or value-added tax) claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of a valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. See Notes 11 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities.Legal MattersA variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to manage the volatility of:•inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a LIFO basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels and•forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable.We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our price risk activities. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows.52Table of ContentsOur positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): Derivative Instruments Held For Non-Trading Purposes TradingPurposesDecember 31, 2015: Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices$(45) $—10% decrease in underlying commodity prices45 5 December 31, 2014: Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices(127) (2)10% decrease in underlying commodity prices126 7See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2015.COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits and GHG emission credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs. To manage these risks, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. As of December 31, 2015, there was an immaterial amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs.53Table of ContentsINTEREST RATE RISKThe following table provides information about our debt obligations (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.

You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “projection,” “predict,” “budget,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “target,” “could,” “should,” “may,” and similar expressions.These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding:•future refining margins, including gasoline and distillate margins;•future ethanol margins;•expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil differentials, and operating expenses;•anticipated levels of crude oil and refined petroleum product inventories;•our anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred costs for refinery turnarounds and catalyst, capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and joint venture investments, and the effect of those capital investments on our results of operations;•anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products in the regions where we operate, as well as globally;•expectations regarding environmental, tax, and other regulatory initiatives; and•the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining and ethanol industry fundamentals.We based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following:•acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined petroleum products or receive feedstocks;•political and economic conditions in nations that produce crude oil or consume refined petroleum products;•demand for, and supplies of, refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, and ethanol;•demand for, and supplies of, crude oil and other feedstocks;•the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls;•the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations;•refinery overcapacity or undercapacity;23Table of Contents•our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations;•the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and adjustments to refining capacity in response to market conditions;•the level of competitors’ imports into markets that we supply;•accidents, unscheduled shutdowns, or other catastrophes affecting our refineries, machinery, pipelines, equipment, and information systems, or those of our suppliers or customers;•changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined petroleum products;•the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles;•the levels of government subsidies for alternative fuels;•the volatility in the market price of biofuel credits (primarily RINs needed to comply with the RFS) and GHG emission credits needed to comply with the requirements of various GHG emission programs;•delay of, cancellation of, or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects;•earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil, grain and other feedstocks, and refined petroleum products and ethanol;•rulings, judgments, or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs, in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage;•legislative or regulatory action, including the introduction or enactment of legislation or rulemakings by governmental authorities, including tax and environmental regulations, such as those implemented under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (also known as AB 32), Quebec’s Regulation respecting the cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emission allowances (the Quebec cap-and-trade system), and the U.S. EPA’s regulation of GHGs, which may adversely affect our business or operations;•changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and trade credit;•changes in currency exchange rates, including the value of the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling, and the euro relative to the U.S. dollar;•overall economic conditions, including the stability and liquidity of financial markets; and•other factors generally described in the “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this report.Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so.All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.This report includes references to financial measures that are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders, gross margin, and adjusted operating income. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between periods. See the accompanying financial tables in “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 24Table of Contentsfinancial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. In note (d) to the accompanying tables, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information.OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOKOverviewFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of $2.3 billion and adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of $1.7 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of $4.0 billion and adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of $4.6 billion. The decrease in net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of $1.7 billion and the decrease in adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of $2.9 billion are outlined in the following table (in millions). Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 ChangeNet income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholdersfrom continuing operations $2,289 $3,990 $(1,701)Adjusted net income attributable toValero Energy Corporation stockholdersfrom continuing operations(1) 1,724 4,614 (2,890)The decrease in both net income and adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations was due to lower operating income in 2016 compared to 2015 (net of the resulting decrease of $1.1 billion in income tax expense between the years). Operating income decreased by $2.8 billion, while adjusted operating income decreased by $4.3 billion, as outlined by segment in the following table (in millions). Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 ChangeOperating income (loss) by segment: Refining $3,995 $6,973 $(2,978)Ethanol 340 142 198Corporate (763) (757) (6)Total $3,572 $6,358 $(2,786) Adjusted operating income (loss) by segment(1): Refining $3,354 $7,713 $(4,359)Ethanol 290 192 98Corporate (763) (757) (6)Total $2,881 $7,148 $(4,267)__________________________(1) Net income and operating income have been adjusted for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. Each of these adjustments is reflected in the tables on pages 28 and 29. Adjusted amounts are non-GAAP measurements.25Table of ContentsThe $2.8 billion decrease in operating income was impacted by the net effect of noncash adjustments for a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and an asset impairment loss. We have excluded such effects from adjusted operating income because we believe that these adjustments are not indicative of our core operating performance and may obscure the underlying business results and trends. The resulting $4.3 billion decrease in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the following:•Refining segment - The $4.4 billion decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to lower margins on refined petroleum products and lower discounts on light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil, which also negatively impacted our refining margins. This is more fully described on pages 37 and 38.•Ethanol segment - The $98 million increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to higher ethanol margins that resulted from lower corn prices combined with lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower margins on other co-products. This is more fully described on page 38.Additional details and analysis of the changes in the operating income and adjusted operating income of our business segments and other components of net income and adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this Overview to their most comparable measures reported under U.S. GAAP, are provided below under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” beginning on page 27.OutlookFor the year ended December 31, 2016, margins were unfavorable compared to 2015, and thus far in the first quarter of 2017 margins have been mixed. Below are several factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2017:•Refining and ethanol product margins are expected to remain near current levels.•Crude oil discounts are expected to remain weak due to lower demand resulting from industry-wide refinery maintenance.26Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market prices that directly impact our operations. In addition, these tables include financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and represent non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and include adjusted net income attributed to Valero stockholders, adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Valero stockholders, adjusted operating income, and gross margin. In note (d) to these tables, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information. The narrative following these tables provides an analysis of our results of operations.2016 Compared to 2015Financial Highlights(millions of dollars, except share and per share amounts) Year Ended

(excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment)” decreased $7.9 billion (or 11 percent) for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in refined petroleum products prices and crude oil feedstock costs, respectively. Operating income decreased $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in refining segment operating income of $3.0 billion, partially offset by an increase in ethanol segment operating income of $198 million. Adjusted operating income decreased $4.3 billion for 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease in refining segment adjusted operating income of $4.4 billion, partially offset by an increase in ethanol segment adjusted operating income of $98 million. The reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed below.RefiningRefining segment adjusted operating income decreased $4.4 billion for 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $4.3 billion decrease in refining gross margin.Refining gross margin decreased $4.3 billion (a $4.43 per barrel decrease) for 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the following:•Decrease in gasoline margins - We experienced a decrease in gasoline margins throughout all of our regions in 2016 compared to 2015. For example, WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent CBOB gasoline was $11.82 per barrel in 2016 compared to $17.59 per barrel in 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $5.77 per barrel. Another example is the ANS-based reference margin for U.S. West Coast CARBOB 87 gasoline was $17.04 per barrel in 2016 compared to $25.56 per barrel in 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $8.52 per barrel. We estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $1.7 billion.•Decrease in distillate margins - We experienced a decrease in distillate margins throughout all of our regions in 2016 compared to 2015. For example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel was $10.21 per barrel in 2016 compared to $12.64 per barrel in 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $2.43 per barrel. Another example is the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low-sulfur diesel that was $13.03 per barrel in 2016 compared to $19.02 per barrel in 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $5.99 per barrel. We estimate that the decrease in distillate margins per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $1.6 billion.•Lower discounts on light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils - The market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, and we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil, such as WTI crude oil, in periods when pricing terms are favorable. During 2016, we benefited from processing WTI crude oil; however, that benefit declined compared to the benefit from processing WTI crude oil during 2015. For example, WTI crude oil processed in our U.S. Mid-Continent region sold at a discount of $1.83 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2016 compared to a discount of $4.91 per barrel in 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $3.08 per barrel. Another example is Maya crude oil (a type of sour crude oil) that sold at a discount of $8.63 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2016 compared to a discount of $9.54 per barrel in 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $0.91 per barrel. We estimate that the cost of light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils during 2016 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $900 million.37Table of Contents•Higher costs of biofuel credits - As more fully described in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we must purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending obligation under various government and regulatory compliance programs, and the cost of these credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) increased by $309 million from $440 million in 2015 to $749 million in 2016. This increase was due to an increase in the market price of RINs caused by an expected shortage in the market of available RINs that worsened in November 2016 with the release of the U.S. EPA’s final 2017 renewable fuel volume requirements.•Higher throughput volumes - Refining throughput volumes increased by 56,000 BPD in 2016. We estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes had a positive impact on our refining margin of approximately $175 million.EthanolEthanol segment adjusted operating income increased $98 million for 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an $81 million (or $0.06 per gallon) increase in gross margin and a $33 million decrease in operating expenses.The increase in ethanol segment gross margin of $81 million was primarily due to the following:•Lower corn prices - Corn prices were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher yields from the current corn crop in the corn-producing regions of the U.S. Mid-Continent. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) corn price was $3.58 per bushel in 2016 compared to $3.77 per bushel in 2015. We estimate that the decrease in the price of corn that we processed during 2016 had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $105 million.•Higher ethanol prices - Ethanol prices were slightly higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased ethanol demand. Despite higher domestic production during 2016, inventory levels declined during the year primarily due to higher exports. For example, the CBOT ethanol price was $1.53 per gallon in 2016 compared to $1.50 per gallon in 2015. We estimate that the increase in the price of ethanol per gallon during 2016 had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $24 million.•Increased production volumes - Ethanol margin was favorably impacted by increased production volumes of 15,000 gallons per day in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to improved operating efficiencies and mechanical reliability. Our ethanol margin was also favorably impacted by higher co-product production volumes between the years. We estimate that the increase in ethanol and co-product production volumes had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $22 million.•Lower co-product prices - A decrease in export demand for corn-related co-products, primarily distillers grains, had an unfavorable effect on the prices we received. We estimate that the decrease in corn-related co-products prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $70 million.The $33 million decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a $14 million decrease in energy costs related to lower natural gas prices ($2.46 per MMBtu in 2016 compared to $2.58 per MMBtu in 2015) and a $15 million decrease in chemical costs.The increase of $16 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a $10 million gain on the sale of certain plant assets in 2015 that was reflected in depreciation and amortization expense thereby reducing depreciation and amortization expense in that period.38Table of ContentsOtherIncome tax expense decreased $1.1 billion from 2015 to 2016 primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense. The effective tax rates of 24 percent in 2016 and 31 percent in 2015 are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent because income from our international operations is taxed at statutory rates that are lower than in the U.S. The 2016 rate was lower than the 2015 rate due to (i) the reversal of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve of $747 million, the majority of which impacted our international operations that are taxed at lower statutory tax rates, (ii) a benefit of $42 million associated with the transfer of ownership of the Aruba Refinery and Aruba Terminal to the GOA, and (iii) a benefit of $35 million resulting from the settlement of an income tax audit. The transfer of ownership of the Aruba Refinery and the Aruba Terminal to the GOA is more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.39Table of Contents2015 Compared to

pages 27 through 36 and pages 40 through 49.(a)In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market. When the market price of our inventory falls below cost, we record a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment to write down the value to market. In subsequent periods, the value of our inventory is reassessed and a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment is recorded to reflect the net change in the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve between periods. As of December 31, 2016, the market price of our inventory was above cost; therefore, we did not have a lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve as of that date. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in our inventory valuation reserve that was established on December 31, 2015, resulting in a noncash benefit of $747 million, of which $697 million and $50 million were attributable to our refining segment and ethanol segment, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2015 includes a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment that resulted in a noncash charge of $790 million, of which $740 million and $50 million were attributable to our refining segment and ethanol segment, respectively. The noncash benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 differs from the noncash charge for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the foreign currency effect of inventories held by our international operations. This adjustment is further discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(b)Effective October 1, 2016, we (i) transferred ownership of all of our assets in Aruba, other than certain hydrocarbon inventories and working capital, to Refineria di Aruba N.V. (RDA), an entity wholly-owned by the GOA, (ii) settled our obligations under various agreements with the GOA, including agreements that required us to dismantle our leasehold improvements under certain conditions, and (iii) sold the working capital of our Aruba operations, including hydrocarbon inventories, to the GOA, CITGO Aruba Refining N.V. (CAR), and CITGO Petroleum Corporation (together with CAR and certain other affiliates, collectively, CITGO). We refer to this transaction as the “Aruba Disposition.”In June 2016, we recognized an asset impairment loss of $56 million representing all of the remaining carrying value of the long-lived assets of our crude oil and refined petroleum products terminal and transshipment facility in Aruba (collectively, the Aruba Terminal). We recognized the impairment loss at that time because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would ultimately transfer ownership of these assets to the GOA as a result of agreements entered into in June 2016 between the GOA and CITGO for the GOA’s lease of those assets to CITGO.In September 2016 and in connection with the Aruba Disposition, our U.S. subsidiaries cancelled all outstanding debt obligations owed to them by our Aruba subsidiaries, which resulted in the recognition by us of an income tax benefit in the U.S. during the year ended December 31, 2016. We had no income tax effect in Aruba from the cancellation of debt or other effects of the Aruba Disposition because of net operating loss carryforwards associated with our operations in Aruba against which we had previously recorded a full valuation allowance. There was no other significant effect to our results of operations or cash flows from the Aruba Disposition during the year ended December 31, 2016.(c)The variation in the customary relationship between income tax expense and income before income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to the higher earnings from our international operations that are taxed at statutory rates that are lower than in the U.S. and the recognition of an income tax benefit in the U.S. in connection with the Aruba Disposition (see note (b) above).(d)We use certain financial measures (as noted below) that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures.We have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of 50Table of Contentsoperations as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes the utility of these measures.Non-GAAP measures are as follows:◦Adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders is defined as net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, its related income tax effect, the asset impairment loss, and the income tax benefit on the Aruba Disposition.◦Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders is defined as net income from continuing operations attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, its related income tax effect, the LIFO gain, and its related income tax effect (see (e) below).◦Gross margin is defined as operating income excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, asset impairment loss, and LIFO gain (see (e) below).◦Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and the asset impairment loss. For the year ended December 31, 2014, adjusted operating income is further defined to exclude the LIFO gain (see (e) below).(e)“Cost of sales (excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment)” for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects a LIFO gain of $233 million, of which $229 million and $4 million were attributable to our refining segment and ethanol segment, respectively.(f)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.(g)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.(h)Throughput margin per barrel represents gross margin (as defined in (d) above) for our refining segment or refining regions divided by the respective throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents gross margin (as defined in (d) above) for our ethanol segment divided by production volumes. Throughput and production volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput and production volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables) by the number of days in the applicable period.(i)Adjusted operating income per barrel represents adjusted operating income (defined in (d) above) for our refining segment or refining regions divided by the respective throughput volumes. Adjusted operating income per gallon of production represents adjusted operating income (defined in (d) above) for our ethanol segment divided by production volumes. Throughput and production volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput and production volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables) by the number of days in the applicable period.(j)Average market reference prices for LLS crude oil, along with price differentials between the price of LLS crude oil and other types of crude oils are reflected without adjusting for the impact of the futures pricing for the corresponding delivery month. Therefore, the prices reported reflect the prompt month pricing only, without an adjustment for futures pricing (known in the industry as the Calendar Month Average (CMA) “roll” adjustment). We previously had provided average market reference prices that included the CMA “roll” adjustment. Accordingly, the average market reference price and price differentials for LLS crude oil for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.51Table of Contents(k)Average market reference price differentials to Mars crude oil have been replaced by average market reference price differentials to ASCI crude oil. Mars crude oil is one of the three grades of sour crude oil used to create ASCI crude oil, and therefore, ASCI crude oil is a more comprehensive price marker for medium sour crude oil. Accordingly, the price differentials for ASCI crude oil for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are included to conform to the current presentation.GeneralOperating revenues decreased $43.0 billion (or 33 percent) and “cost of sales (excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment)” decreased $44.3 billion (or 37 percent) for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in refined petroleum product prices and crude oil feedstock costs, respectively. Despite the decrease in operating revenues, “cost of sales (excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment)” decreased to a greater extent resulting in an increase in operating income of $456 million in 2015, with refining segment operating income increasing by $1.1 billion and ethanol segment operating income decreasing by $644 million. Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in refining segment adjusted operating income of $2.1 billion, partially offset by a decrease in ethanol segment adjusted operating income of $590 million. The reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed below.RefiningRefining segment adjusted operating income increased $2.1 billion for 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $2.1 billion increase in refining gross margin and a $105 million decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by a $148 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.Refining gross margin increased $2.1 billion (a $1.92 per barrel increase) for 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the following:•Increase in gasoline margins - We experienced an increase in gasoline margins throughout all our regions during 2015. For example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast CBOB gasoline was $9.83 per barrel in 2015 compared to $3.54 per barrel in 2014, a favorable increase of $6.29 per barrel. Another example is the ANS-based reference margin for U.S. West Coast CARBOB gasoline that was $25.56 per barrel in 2015 compared to $13.40 per barrel in 2014, a favorable increase of $12.16 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in gasoline margins per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $2.9 billion.•Increase in other refined petroleum products margins - We experienced an increase in the margins of other refined petroleum products such as petroleum coke, propane, sulfur, and lubes in 2015 compared to 2014. Margins for other refined petroleum products were higher during 2015 due to the lower cost of crude oils in 2015 compared to 2014. Because the market prices for our other refined petroleum products remain relatively stable, we benefit when the cost of crude oils that we process declines. For example, the benchmark price of Brent crude oil was $53.62 per barrel in 2015 compared to $99.57 per barrel in 2014. We estimate that the increase in margins for other refined petroleum products in 2015 compared to 2014 had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $1.6 billion.•Lower discounts on light sweet and sour crude oils - Because the market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. For 2015, the discount in the price of light sweet and sour crude oils compared to the price of Brent crude oil narrowed. Therefore, while we benefitted from processing crude oils priced at a discount to Brent crude oil, that benefit declined 52Table of Contentsin 2015 compared to 2014. For example, we processed LLS crude oil (a type of light sweet crude oil) in our U.S. Gulf Coast region that sold at a discount of $1.26 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2015 compared to $2.77 per barrel in 2014, representing an unfavorable decrease of $1.51 per barrel. Another example is Maya crude oil (a type of sour crude oil) that sold at a discount of $9.54 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2015 compared to a discount of $13.73 per barrel in 2014, representing an unfavorable decrease of $4.19 per barrel. We estimate that the narrowing of the discounts for sweet crude oils and sour crude oils that we processed during 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $260 million and $770 million, respectively.•Lower benefit from processing other feedstocks - In addition to crude oil, we use other feedstocks and blendstocks in our refining processes, such as natural gas. When combined with steam, natural gas produces hydrogen that is used in our hydrotreater and hydrocracker processing units to produce refined petroleum products. Although natural gas costs declined from 2014 to 2015, the decline was not as significant as the decline in the cost of Brent crude oil; therefore, the benefit we normally derive by using natural gas as a feedstock declined. We estimate that the decline in the benefit we derived from processing other feedstocks had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $980 million in 2015 compared to 2014.•Decrease in distillate margins - We experienced a decrease in distillate margins throughout all our regions during 2015. For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low-sulfur diesel (a type of distillate) was $19.02 per barrel in 2015 compared to $24.05 per barrel in 2014, an unfavorable decrease of $5.03 per barrel. Another example is the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel that was $12.64 per barrel in 2015 compared to $14.28 per barrel in 2014, an unfavorable decrease of $1.64 per barrel. We estimate that the decrease in distillate margins per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $650 million.•Higher throughput volumes - Refining throughput volumes increased by 34,000 BPD in 2015. We estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $160 million in 2015.The decrease of $105 million in operating expenses was primarily due to a $196 million decrease in energy costs driven by lower natural gas prices ($2.58 per MMBtu in 2015 compared to $4.36 per MMBtu in 2014). This decrease in energy costs was partially offset by a $47 million increase in employee-related expenses primarily due to higher employee benefit costs and incentive compensation expenses, and a $26 million increase in costs associated with higher levels of maintenance activities in 2015.The increase of $148 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily associated with the impact of new capital projects that began operating in 2015 and higher refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization.EthanolEthanol segment adjusted operating income decreased $590 million for 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $628 million decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a $39 million decrease in operating expenses.53Table of ContentsThe decrease in ethanol segment gross margin of $628 million was primarily due to the following:•Lower ethanol prices - Ethanol prices were lower in 2015 primarily due to the decrease in crude oil and gasoline prices in 2015 compared to 2014. For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $1.59 per gallon in 2015 compared to $2.37 per gallon in 2014. We estimate that the decrease in the price of ethanol per gallon during 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $800 million.•Lower corn prices - Corn prices were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a higher domestic corn yield realized during the 2014 fall harvest (most of which is processed in the following year). For example, the CBOT corn price was $3.77 per bushel in 2015 compared to $4.16 per bushel in 2014. We estimate that the decrease in the price of corn that we processed during 2015 had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $160 million.•Lower co-product prices - The decrease in corn prices in 2015 compared to 2014 had a negative effect on the prices we received for corn-related ethanol co-products, such as distillers grains and corn oil. We estimate that the decrease in co-product prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $40 million.•Increased production volumes - Ethanol margin was favorably impacted by increased production volumes of 405,000 gallons per day in 2015. Production volumes in 2014 were negatively impacted by weather-related rail disruptions. In addition, production volumes in 2015 were positively impacted by production volumes from our Mount Vernon plant, which began operations in August 2014. We estimate that the increase in production volumes had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $50 million.The $39 million decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a $40 million decrease in energy costs related to lower natural gas prices ($2.58 per MMBtu in 2015 compared to $4.36 per MMBtu in 2014).Other“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” increased by $36 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to the impact from $1.25 billion of debt issued by Valero and $200 million borrowed by VLP under its $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the VLP Revolver) in 2015.Income tax expense increased $93 million in 2015. This increase was lower than expected given the increase in income from continuing operations of $419 million and was primarily due to earnings from our international operations that are taxed at statutory tax rates that are lower than in the U.S. In addition, in 2015, the U.K. statutory rate was lowered and we favorably settled various U.S. income tax audits.The loss from discontinued operations in 2014 includes expenses of $64 million primarily related to an asset retirement obligation associated with our decision in May 2014 to abandon the Aruba Refinery, as further described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.54Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Our operations generated $4.8 billion of cash in 2016, driven primarily by net income of $2.4 billion, net noncash charges to income of $1.4 billion, and a positive change in working capital of $976 million. Noncash charges include $1.9 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $56 million for the asset impairment loss associated with our Aruba Terminal, and $230 million of deferred income tax expense, partially offset by a benefit of $747 million from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. The change in our working capital is further detailed in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This source of cash mainly resulted from:•an increase in accounts payable, offset by an increase in receivables, primarily as a result of higher commodity prices;•a reduction of our inventories; and•a reduction in income taxes receivable due to utilization in 2016 of our 2015 overpayment of taxes.The $4.8 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with $2.2 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt (including $1.25 billion of 3.4 percent Senior Notes due September 15, 2026, $500 million of 4.375 percent Senior Notes due December 15, 2026 issued by VLP, and borrowings under the VLP Revolver of $349 million as discussed in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), were used mainly to:•fund $2.0 billion in capital investments,which include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and equity-method joint venture investments;•redeem our 6.125 percent Senior Notes for $778 million (or 103.70 percent of stated value) and our 7.2 percent Senior Notes for $213 million (or 106.27 percent of stated value);•make payments on debt and capital lease obligations of $525 million, of which $494 million related to borrowings under the VLP Revolver, $9 million related to capital lease obligations, and $22 million related to other non-bank debt;•pay off a long-term liability of $137 million owed to a joint venture partner for an owner-method joint venture investment;•purchase common stock for treasury of $1.3 billion;•pay common stock dividends of $1.1 billion;•pay distributions of $65 million to noncontrolling interests; and•increase available cash on hand by $702 million.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Our operations generated $5.6 billion of cash in 2015, driven primarily by net income of $4.1 billion and net noncash charges to income of $2.8 billion. Noncash charges include $1.8 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $790 million from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, and $165 million of deferred income tax expense. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. However, the change in our working capital during the year had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of $1.3 billion as shown in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This use of cash mainly resulted from:•a decrease in accounts payable, net of a decrease in receivables, primarily as a result of a decrease in commodity prices from December 2014 to December 2015;•an increase in income taxes receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable due to tax payments associated with the settlement of several IRS audits and an overpayment of taxes in 2015. This overpayment resulted from a change in the U.S. Federal tax laws late in the year that reinstated the bonus depreciation deduction, which lowered our current income tax expense; and55Table of Contents•an increase in inventories, mainly due to the build in inventory volumes in 2015 as we purchased crude oil at prices we deemed favorable during the fourth quarter of 2015.The $5.6 billion of cash generated by our operations in 2015, along with (i) $1.45 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt and (ii) net proceeds of $189 million from VLP’s public offering of 4,250,000 common units as discussed in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, were used mainly to:•fund $2.4 billion in capital investments, which include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and equity-method joint venture investments;•make payments on debt and capital lease obligations of $513 million, of which $400 million related to our 4.5 percent Senior Notes, $75 million related to our 8.75 percent debentures, $25 million related to the VLP Revolver, $10 million related to capital lease obligations, and $3 million related to other non-bank debt;•purchase common stock for treasury of $2.8 billion;•pay common stock dividends of $848 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $425 million.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Our operations generated $4.2 billion of cash in 2014, driven primarily by net income of $3.7 billion and $2.2 billion of noncash charges to income. Noncash charges include $1.7 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $63 million of asset retirement and other expenses associated with our Aruba Refinery, and $445 million of deferred income tax expense. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. However, the change in our working capital during the year had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of $1.8 billion as shown in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This use of cash mainly resulted from:•a decrease in accounts receivable, which was offset by a decrease in accounts payable, primarily as a result of a decrease in commodity prices from December 2013 to December 2014;•a decrease in income taxes payable resulting from income tax payments exceeding income tax liabilities incurred in 2014 due to the payment of liabilities associated with prior period earnings; and•an increase in inventories mainly due to the build in inventory volumes from 2013 to 2014 as we purchased crude oil at prices we deemed favorable during the fourth quarter of 2014.The $4.2 billion of cash generated by our operations in 2014, along with $603 million from available cash on hand, were used mainly to:•fund $2.8 billion in capital investments, which include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and equity-method joint venture investments;•make payments on debt and capital lease obligations of $204 million, of which $200 million related to our 4.75 percent Senior Notes, and $4 million related to capital lease obligations;•purchase common stock for treasury of $1.3 billion; and•pay common stock dividends of $554 million.Capital InvestmentsWe define capital investments as capital expenditures for additions to and improvements of our refining and ethanol segment assets (including turnaround and catalyst costs) and investments in joint ventures.Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are improved continuously. The cost of improvements, which consist of the addition of new Units and 56Table of Contentsbetterments of existing Units, can be significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly.We hold equity-method investments in joint ventures and we invest in these joint ventures or enter into new joint venture arrangements to enhance our operations. In December 2015, we exercised our option to purchase a 50 percent interest in Diamond Pipeline LLC (Diamond Pipeline), which was formed by Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (Plains) to construct and operate a 440-mile, 20-inch crude oil pipeline expected to provide capacity of up to 200,000 BPD of domestic sweet crude oil from the Plains Cushing, Oklahoma terminal to our Memphis Refinery, with the ability to connect into the Capline Pipeline. The pipeline is expected to be completed in 2017 for an estimated $925 million. We have contributed $138 million in Diamond Pipeline and expect to continue making contributions as the construction progresses.For 2017, we expect to incur approximately $2.7 billion for capital investments, including capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and equity-method joint venture investments. This consists of approximately $1.6 billion for stay-in-business capital and $1.1 billion for growth strategies, including our continued investment in Diamond Pipeline. This capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter TotalDebt and capitallease obligations (a)$122 $21 $771 $898 $17 $6,281 $8,110Operating lease obligations479 321 221 162 106 362 1,651Purchase obligations21,750 3,517 1,986 1,446 1,116 5,483 35,298Other long-term liabilities— 125 88 85 80 1,366 1,744Total$22,351 $3,984 $3,066 $2,591 $1,319 $13,492 $46,803______________________________(a)Debt obligations exclude amounts related to unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. Capital lease obligations include related interest expense. These items are further described in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In October 2016, we entered into agreements to lease storage tanks located at three of our refineries. The leases commenced in January 2017. The lease agreements will be accounted for as capital leases and we expect to recognize capital lease assets and related obligations of approximately $490 million. These capital 57Table of Contentslease agreements have initial terms of 10 years each and each agreement has successive 10-year automatic renewal terms.Debt and Capital Lease ObligationsWe have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis. In July 2016, we amended our agreement to decrease the facility from $1.4 billion to $1.3 billion and extended the maturity date to July 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the amount of eligible receivables sold was $100 million. All amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt.Our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. All of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: RatingRating Agency Valero VLPMoody’s Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook) Baa3 (stable outlook)Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook) BBB- (stable outlook)Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook) BBB- (stable outlook)We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.Operating Lease ObligationsOur operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks, refined petroleum products, and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed 58Table of Contentsor minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions.Other Long-term LiabilitiesOur other long-term liabilities are described in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2016.Summary of Credit FacilitiesAs of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings, letters of credit issued, and availability under our credit facilities as follows (in millions): December 31, 2016 FacilityAmount Maturity Date OutstandingBorrowings Letters ofCredit Issued Availability Committed facilities: Valero Revolver $3,000 November 2020 $— $53 $2,947VLP Revolver $750 November 2020 $30 $— $720Canadian Revolver C$25 November 2017 C$— C$10 C$15Accounts receivable sales facility $1,300 July 2017 $100 $— $1,200Letter of credit facilities $225 June 2017 and November 2017 $— $— $225Uncommitted facilities: Letter of credit facilities $670 N/A $— $202 $468Letters of credit issued as of December 31, 2016 expire in 2017 through 2018.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Purchase ProgramsOn September 21, 2016, our board of directors authorized our purchase of up to an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common stock (the 2016 program) with no expiration date. This authorization was in addition to the remaining amount available under a $2.5 billion program authorized on July 13, 2015 (the 2015 program). As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $2.5 billion remaining available under the 2015 program and the 2016 program, but we have no obligation to make purchases under these programs.Pension Plan FundingWe plan to contribute approximately $28 million to our pension plans and $19 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2017.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and 59Table of Contentsregulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future as previously discussed above in “OUTLOOK.” In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Notes 7 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters.Tax MattersDuring 2016, we settled the audit related to our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2008 and 2009. The IRS has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal income tax returns from 2010 through 2014, and we have received Revenue Agent Reports (RARs) in connection with the 2010 and 2011 audit. We are contesting certain tax positions and assertions included in the RARs and continue to make progress in resolving certain of these matters with the IRS. We believe that the ultimate settlement of these audits will not be material to our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.Cash Held by Our International SubsidiariesWe operate in countries outside the U.S. through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries, and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the U.S. in the form of cash dividends. Should we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated. In addition, such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations, as further discussed in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe, however, that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the U.S. without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings. As of December 31, 2016, $2.2 billion of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries.Concentration of CustomersOur operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.Sources of LiquidityWe believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAs discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will become effective for our financial statements in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements, except as otherwise disclosed.60Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes.Lower of Cost or Market Inventory ValuationInventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally determined under the LIFO method using the dollar-value LIFO approach. Market value is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories.We compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis, excluding materials and supplies. In determining the market value of our inventories, we assume our refinery and ethanol feedstocks are converted into refined petroleum products, which requires us to make estimates regarding the refined petroleum products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined petroleum products. We also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our refineries and ethanol plants to the appropriate points of sale. We then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories. If the aggregate market value is less than cost, we record a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment to reflect our inventories at market value.The lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Property, Plant, and EquipmentDepreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation. We maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries. We estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group, and such evaluations consist of, but are not limited to, the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition, consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained, assessment of the need to replace assets, and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group. The estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years.Under the composite method of depreciation, the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life. We design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications, design standards, and practices accepted in our industry, and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives. Therefore, we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group. It should be noted, however, that factors such as competition, regulation, or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting depreciation expense in the future.61Table of ContentsImpairment of AssetsLong-lived assets and equity method investments are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.In order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies.The amount of our accruals for environmental matters as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit ObligationsWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are disclosed and described in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we utilized a forward-looking model of asset returns. The historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to December 31, 2016 was 5.50 percent. The actual return on assets for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was 7.77 percent, 1.46 percent, and 7.33 percent, respectively. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements. For example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the 62Table of Contentsfollowing effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2017 (in millions): Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefitsIncrease in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease$106 $9Compensation rate increase12 n/aHealth care cost trend rate increasen/a 1 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease9 1Expected return on plan assets decrease5 n/aCompensation rate increase3 n/aHealth care cost trend rate increasen/a —Beginning in 2016, our net periodic benefit cost is determined using the spot-rate approach. Under this approach, our net periodic benefit cost is impacted by the spot rates of the corporate bond yield curve used to calculate our liability discount rate. If the yield curve were to flatten entirely and our liability discount rate remained unchanged, our net periodic benefit cost would increase by $18 million for pension benefits and $2 million for other postretirement benefits in 2017.See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.Tax MattersWe record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to an indirect tax (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and/or value-added tax) claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of a valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities.Legal MattersA variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages.63Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined petroleum products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), soybean oil, and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to manage the volatility of:•inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a LIFO basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels and•forecasted feedstock and refined petroleum product purchases, refined petroleum product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable.We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our price risk activities. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows.Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): Derivative Instruments Held For Non-Trading Purposes TradingPurposesDecember 31, 2016: Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices$61 $(22)10% decrease in underlying commodity prices(61) 11 December 31, 2015: Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices(45) —10% decrease in underlying commodity prices45 5See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2016.64Table of ContentsCOMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits and GHG emission credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs. To manage these risks, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. As of December 31, 2016, there was an immaterial amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs.INTEREST RATE RISKThe following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” included in this report.CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995This report, including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK,” includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “projection,” “predict,” “budget,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “target,” “could,” “should,” “may,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding:•future refining segment margins, including gasoline and distillate margins;•future ethanol segment margins;•expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil differentials, and operating expenses;•anticipated levels of crude oil and refined petroleum product inventories;•our anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred costs for refinery turnarounds and catalyst, capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and joint venture investments, and the effect of those capital investments on our results of operations;•anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products in the regions where we operate, as well as globally;•expectations regarding environmental, tax, and other regulatory initiatives; and•the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining, ethanol, and midstream industry fundamentals.We based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following:•acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined petroleum products or receive feedstocks;•political and economic conditions in nations that produce crude oil or consume refined petroleum products;•demand for, and supplies of, refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, and ethanol;•demand for, and supplies of, crude oil and other feedstocks;•the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls;•the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations;28Table of Contents•refinery overcapacity or undercapacity;•our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations;•the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and adjustments to refining capacity in response to market conditions;•the level of competitors’ imports into markets that we supply;•accidents, unscheduled shutdowns, or other catastrophes affecting our refineries, machinery, pipelines, equipment, and information systems, or those of our suppliers or customers;•changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined petroleum products;•the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles;•the levels of government subsidies for alternative fuels;•the volatility in the market price of biofuel credits (primarily RINs needed to comply with the RFS) and GHG emission credits needed to comply with the requirements of various GHG emission programs;•delay of, cancellation of, or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects;•earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil, grain and other feedstocks, and refined petroleum products and ethanol;•rulings, judgments, or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs, in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage;•legislative or regulatory action, including the introduction or enactment of legislation or rulemakings by governmental authorities, including tax and environmental regulations, such as those implemented under the California cap-and-trade system (also known as AB 32), the Quebec cap-and-trade system, the Ontario cap-and-trade system, and the U.S. EPA’s regulation of GHGs, which may adversely affect our business or operations;•changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and trade credit;•changes in currency exchange rates, including the value of the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling, the euro, and the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar;•overall economic conditions, including the stability and liquidity of financial markets; and•other factors generally described in the “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this report.Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so.All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.This report includes references to financial measures that are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders, adjusted operating income (loss), and refining and ethanol segment margin. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between periods. See the accompanying financial tables in “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” and note (d) to the 29Table of Contentsaccompanying tables for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Also in note (d), we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information.OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOKOverviewFor 2017, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $4.1 billion compared to $2.3 billion for 2016, which represents an increase of $1.8 billion. This increase is primarily due to a $1.9 billion income tax benefit in 2017 resulting from the implementation of the provisions under Tax Reform, which was enacted on December 22, 2017. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about Tax Reform and the $1.9 billion benefit recorded by us. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders in 2017 was $2.2 billion. This compares to adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $1.7 billion in 2016, which has been adjusted for the amounts reflected in the table on page 34. The $479 million increase in adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was primarily due to a $779 million increase in adjusted operating income between the years net of the resulting increase in income tax expense.Operating income was $3.6 billion in each of 2017 and 2016. Excluding the amounts reflected in the tables on page 34 from both years, adjusted operating income was $3.7 billion in 2017 compared to $2.9 billion in 2016, which represents an increase of $779 million.The $779 million increase in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the following:•Refining segment. Refining segment adjusted operating income increased by $942 million due to higher margins on refined petroleum products and higher throughput volumes, partially offset by lower discounts on sour crude oils and other feedstocks, higher cost of biofuel credits, and higher operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense). This is more fully described on pages 38 through 40.•Ethanol segment. Ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased by $118 million primarily due to lower ethanol and corn related co-products prices. This is more fully described on page 40.•VLP segment. VLP segment adjusted operating income increased by $74 million primarily due to incremental revenues generated from transportation and terminaling services provided to our refining segment associated with terminals acquired in 2016 and 2017, a product pipeline system acquired in 2017, and the acquisition of an undivided interest in crude system assets in 2017. This is more fully described on page 41.•Corporate and eliminations. Corporate and eliminations, which consists primarily of general and administrative expenses and related depreciation and amortization expense, increased by $119 million primarily due to higher employee related costs, legal and environmental reserves, and other expenses, which are more fully described on page 38.Additional details and analysis for the changes in operating income and adjusted operating income for our reportable business segments and other components of net income and adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this Overview to their most comparable measures reported under U.S. GAAP, are provided below under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS”.30Table of ContentsOutlookBelow are several factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2018:•Refining and ethanol margins are expected to remain near current levels.•Medium and heavy sour crude oil discounts are expected to remain weaker than their five-year averages as supplies of sour crude oils in the market remain suppressed.•Sweet crude discounts are expected to remain near current levels as export demand remains strong and increased supplies from the Permian Basin are delivered into U.S. Gulf Coast markets.•Legislation authorizing the extension of the $1 per gallon biodiesel blender’s tax credit for biodiesel volumes blended in 2017 was passed and signed into law in February 2018. As a result, we will recognize a benefit to cost of materials and other in our refining segment results of operations for the first quarter of 2018 of approximately $170 million. The majority of this amount will be recognized by one of our consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) in which we own a 50 percent interest; therefore, approximately one half of this amount (after taxes) will be excluded from net income attributable to Valero stockholders.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market reference prices that directly impact our operations. In addition, these tables include financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and represent non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and include adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders, adjusted operating income, and refining and ethanol segment margin. In note (d) to these tables, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information.Effective January 1, 2017, we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, we created a new reportable segment — VLP. The results of the VLP segment, which include the results of our majority-owned master limited partnership referred to by the same name, were transferred from the refining segment. Our prior period segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. The narrative following these tables provides an analysis of our results of operations. 31Table of ContentsFinancial Highlights by Segment and Total Company(millions of dollars) Year Ended December

due to increases in refined petroleum product prices associated with our refining segment. This improvement in operating revenues was mostly offset by higher cost of materials and other and increases in other components of cost of sales between the years, resulting in an increase in operating income of $27 million in 2017 compared to 2016.Excluding the adjustments to operating income in both years reflected in the tables on page 34, adjusted operating income was $3.7 billion in 2017 compared to $2.9 billion in 2016. Details regarding the $779 million increase in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below. Corporate and eliminations, which consists primarily of general and administrative expenses and related depreciation and amortization expense, increased by $119 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher employee related costs of $50 million, an increase in legal and environmental reserves of $21 million, expenses associated with the termination of an acquisition transaction of $16 million, and an increase in charitable contributions of $10 million.Income tax expense decreased $1.7 billion from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to a $1.9 billion income tax benefit in 2017 resulting from Tax Reform, which is more fully described in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate for 2017 was 28 percent. This compares to an effective tax rate of 26 percent in 2016, which has been adjusted for the income tax adjustments reflected in the table on page 34. The effective tax rates are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent that was in effect through December 31, 2017, primarily because income from our international operations was taxed at statutory rates that were lower than in the U.S. The effective tax rate in 2016 was lower than the 2017 rate due to a benefit of $35 million resulting from the favorable resolution of an income tax audit.Refining Segment ResultsRefining segment operating revenues increased $18.7 billion and cost of materials and other increased $17.5 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices and crude oil feedstock costs, respectively. The resulting $1.2 billion increase in refining segment margin (as defined in note (d) on page 48) was partially offset by increases in other components of cost of sales between the years, resulting in an increase in operating income of $243 million, from $3.8 billion in 2016 to $4.0 billion in 2017.Excluding the adjustments reflected in the tables on page 34 from operating income in both years, adjusted operating income was $4.1 billion in 2017 compared to $3.1 billion in 2016, an increase of $942 million. The components of this increase are outlined below, along with the reasons for the changes in these components between the years.Refining segment margin increased $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, as previously noted, primarily due to the following:•Increase in distillate margins. We experienced improved distillate margins throughout all of our regions in 2017 compared to 2016. For example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel was $13.26 per barrel in 2017 compared to $10.21 per barrel in 2016, representing a favorable increase of $3.05 per barrel. Another example is the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low-sulfur diesel that was $18.50 per barrel in 2017 compared to $13.03 per barrel in 2016, representing a favorable increase of $5.47 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in distillate margins per barrel in 2017 compared to 2016 had a positive impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $1.2 billion.38Table of Contents•Increase in gasoline margins. We also experienced improved gasoline margins throughout all of our regions in 2017 compared to 2016. For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent CBOB gasoline was $15.65 per barrel in 2017 compared to $11.82 per barrel in 2016, representing a favorable increase of $3.83 per barrel. Another example is the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast CBOB gasoline, which was $10.50 per barrel in 2017 compared to $9.17 per barrel in 2016, representing a favorable increase of $1.33 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in gasoline margins per barrel in 2017 compared to 2016 had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $577 million.•Higher throughput volumes. Refining segment throughput volumes increased by 85,000 BPD in 2017. We estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes had a positive impact on our refining segment margin of approximately $283 million.•Lower discounts on sour crude oils. The market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, and we benefit when we process sour crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. While we benefited from processing these sour crude oils in 2017, that benefit declined compared to 2016. For example, ASCI crude oil processed in our U.S. Gulf Coast region sold at a discount to Brent of $4.18 per barrel in 2017 compared to a discount of $5.18 per barrel in 2016, representing an unfavorable decrease of $1.00 per barrel. Another example is Maya crude oil that sold at a discount to Brent of $7.74 per barrel in 2017 compared to $8.63 per barrel in 2016, representing an unfavorable decrease of $0.89 per barrel. We estimate that the reduction in discounts for sour crude oils that we processed in 2017 had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $305 million.•Lower discounts on other feedstocks. In addition to crude oil, we utilize other feedstocks such as residuals, in certain of our refining processes. We benefit when we process these other feedstocks that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. While we benefited from processing these types of feedstocks in 2017, that benefit declined compared to 2016. We estimate that the reduction in the discounts for the other feedstocks that we processed in 2017 had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $203 million.•Higher costs of biofuel credits. As more fully described in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we must purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending obligation under various government and regulatory compliance programs, and the cost of these credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) increased by $193 million from $749 million in 2016 to $942 million in 2017.•Increase in charges from VLP. Charges from the VLP segment for transportation and terminaling services increased $89 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to additional services provided to the refining segment using terminals acquired by VLP in 2016 and 2017, a pipeline system acquired by VLP in 2017, and an undivided interest in crude system assets acquired by VLP in 2017. The increase in charges from VLP are more fully discussed in the VLP segment analysis below.Refining segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased $221 million primarily due to an increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices ($2.98 per MMBtu in the 2017 compared to $2.46 per MMBtu in 2016).Refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased $66 million due to an increase in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense primarily due to 39Table of Contentscosts incurred in the latter part of 2016 in connection with significant turnaround projects at our Port Arthur and Texas City Refineries.Ethanol Segment ResultsEthanol segment operating revenues decreased $401 million and cost of materials and other decreased $326 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreases in ethanol and corn related co-product prices and lower corn prices, respectively. The resulting $75 million decrease in ethanol segment margin (as defined in note (d) on page 48), along with increases in other components of cost of sales between the years, resulted in a decrease in operating income of $168 million, from $340 million in 2016 to $172 million in 2017.Excluding the adjustment reflected in the table on page 34 from 2016 operating income, adjusted operating income in 2016 was $290 million. Compared to this adjusted amount, operating income in 2017 decreased $118 million. The components of this decrease are outlined below, along with changes in these components between the years.Ethanol segment margin decreased $75 million in 2017 compared to 2016, as previously noted, primarily due to the following:•Lower ethanol prices. Ethanol prices were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher industry production, which resulted in higher domestic inventories. For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $1.56 per gallon in 2017 compared to $1.60 per gallon in 2016. We estimate that the decrease in the price of ethanol had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $73 million.•Lower co-product prices. A decrease in export demand for corn related co-products, primarily distillers grains, had an unfavorable effect on the prices we received. We estimate that the decrease for corn related co-product prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $52 million.•Lower corn prices. Despite a slight increase in the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) corn price from $3.58 per bushel in 2016 to $3.59 per bushel in 2017, we acquired corn at lower prices due to favorable location differentials, resulting in a decrease in the price we paid for corn in 2017 compared to 2016. We estimate that the decrease in the price we paid for corn had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $25 million.•Higher production volumes. Ethanol segment margin was favorably impacted by increased production volumes of 130,000 gallons per day in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reliability improvements. We estimate that the increase in production volumes had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $25 million. Ethanol segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased $28 million primarily due to an increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices ($2.98 per MMBtu in 2017 compared to $2.46 per MMBtu in 2016).Ethanol segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased $15 million primarily due to the write-off of assets that were idled in 2017.40Table of ContentsVLP Segment ResultsVLP segment operating revenues increased $89 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to incremental revenues generated from transportation and terminaling services provided to our refining segment associated with terminals and pipelines acquired in 2016 and 2017. This increase in VLP segment revenues was partially offset by increases in components of cost of sales between the years, resulting in an increase in operating income of $71 million, from $221 million in 2016 to $292 million in 2017.Excluding the adjustment reflected in the table on page 34 from 2017 operating income, adjusted operating income in 2017 was $295 million, an increase of $74 million compared to 2016. The components of this increase are outlined below, along with the reasons for the changes in these components between the years.VLP segment revenues increased $89 million in 2017 compared to 2016, as previously noted, primarily due to the following:•Incremental throughput from acquired businesses and assets. VLP generated incremental terminaling revenues of $56 million from services provided to the refining segment by the McKee, Meraux, Three Rivers, and Port Arthur terminals. The McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers Terminals were acquired in 2016 and the Port Arthur terminal was acquired in 2017. VLP also generated incremental pipeline revenues of $15 million from the Parkway pipeline and Red River crude system, which were acquired in 2017. The incremental revenues generated by these businesses and assets had a favorable impact to VLP’s operating revenues of $71 million.•Higher throughput volumes at systems owned or acquired prior to 2016. The refining segment shipped higher volumes of crude oil and refined petroleum products using VLP’s terminals and pipeline systems owned or acquired prior to 2016, which resulted in incremental revenues of $16 million in 2017.VLP segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased $8 million and $7 million, respectively, primarily due to expenses associated with the Port Arthur terminal, the Parkway pipeline, and the Red River crude system, which were acquired in 2017.41Table

pages 42 through 46.(a)Other operating expenses reflects expenses that are not associated with our cost of sales. Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily includes costs incurred at certain of our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and certain VLP assets due to damage associated with Hurricane Harvey.(b)In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market. When the market price of our inventory falls below cost, we record a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment to write down the value to market. In subsequent periods, the value of our inventory is reassessed and a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment is recorded to reflect the net change in the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve between periods. As of December 31, 2017, the market price of our inventory was above cost; therefore, we did not have a lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve as of that date. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in our inventory valuation reserve that was established on December 31, 2015, resulting in a noncash benefit of $747 million, of which $697 million and $50 million were attributable to our refining segment and ethanol segment, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2015 includes a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment that resulted in a noncash charge of $790 million, of which $740 million and $50 million were attributable to our refining segment and ethanol segment, respectively. The noncash benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 differs from the noncash charge for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the foreign currency effect of inventories held by our international operations.(c)Effective October 1, 2016, we (i) transferred ownership of all of our assets in Aruba, other than certain hydrocarbon inventories and working capital, to Refineria di Aruba N.V. (RDA), an entity wholly-owned by the Government of Aruba (GOA), (ii) settled our obligations under various agreements with the GOA, including agreements that required us to dismantle our leasehold improvements under certain conditions, and (iii) sold the working capital of our Aruba operations, including hydrocarbon inventories, to the GOA, CITGO Aruba Refining N.V. (CAR), and CITGO Petroleum Corporation (together with CAR and certain other affiliates, collectively, CITGO). We refer to this transaction as the “Aruba Disposition.”In June 2016, we recognized an asset impairment loss of $56 million representing all of the remaining carrying value of the long-lived assets of our crude oil and refined petroleum products terminal and transshipment facility in Aruba (collectively, the Aruba Terminal). We recognized the impairment loss at that time because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would ultimately transfer ownership of these assets to the GOA as a result of agreements entered into in June 2016 between the GOA and CITGO for the GOA’s lease of those assets to CITGO.In September 2016 and in connection with the Aruba Disposition, our U.S. subsidiaries cancelled all outstanding debt obligations owed to them by our Aruba subsidiaries, which resulted in the recognition by us of an income tax benefit of $42 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.(d)We use certain financial measures (as noted below) that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures.We have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes the utility of these measures.48Table of ContentsNon-GAAP measures are as follows:◦Adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders is defined as net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, its related income tax effect, the asset impairment loss, the income tax benefit on the Aruba Disposition, and the Tax Reform income tax benefit.◦Refining and ethanol segment margins are defined as segment operating income excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), other operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales, and the asset impairment loss as shown below: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015Reconciliation of refining segment operating income to refining segment margin Operating income$4,017 $3,774 $6,881Add back: Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)3,917 3,696 3,689Depreciation and amortization expense1,800 1,734 1,699Other operating expenses (a)58 — —Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment (b)— (697) 740Asset impairment loss (c)— 56 —Refining segment margin$9,792 $8,563 $13,009 Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015Reconciliation of ethanol segment operating income to ethanol segment margin Operating income$172 $340 $142Add back: Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)443 415 448Depreciation and amortization expense81 66 50Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment (b)— (50) 50Ethanol segment margin$696 $771 $690◦Adjusted refining segment operating income is defined as refining segment operating income excluding other operating expenses, the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, and the asset impairment loss.◦Adjusted ethanol segment operating income is defined as ethanol segment operating income excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment.◦Adjusted VLP segment operating income is defined as VLP segment operating income excluding other operating expenses.(e)On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was enacted, resulting in the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred taxes and the recognition of a liability for taxes on the deemed repatriation of our foreign earnings and profits. Under 49Table of ContentsU.S. GAAP, we are required to recognize the effect of Tax Reform in the period of enactment. As a result, we recognized a $1.9 billion income tax benefit in December 2017, which represents the estimated impact of Tax Reform. This estimate may be refined in future periods as further information becomes available. (f)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.(g)All per barrel of throughput and per gallon of production amounts are calculated by dividing the associated dollar amount by the throughput volumes, production volumes, pipeline transportation throughput volumes, or terminaling throughput volumes for the period, as applicable. Throughput volumes, production volumes, pipeline transportation throughput volumes, and terminaling throughput volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput volumes per day, production volumes per day, pipeline transportation throughput volumes per day, and terminaling throughput volumes per day by the number of days in the applicable period. (h)Adjusted operating income per barrel represents adjusted operating income (defined in (d) above) for our refining segment divided by the respective throughput volumes. Ethanol segment margin per gallon of production represents ethanol segment margin (as defined in (d) above) for our ethanol segment divided by production volumes. Pipeline transportation revenue per barrel and terminaling revenue per barrel represent pipeline transportation revenue and terminaling revenue for our VLP segment divided by pipeline transportation throughput and terminaling throughput volumes, respectively. Throughput and production volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput and production volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables) by the number of days in the applicable period.50Table of ContentsTotal Company, Corporate, and OtherOperating revenues decreased $12.1 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to decreases in refined petroleum products prices associated with our refining segment. This decline in operating revenues was partially offset by lower cost of materials and other and the positive effect from the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments in both years, resulting in a decrease in operating income of $2.8 billion, from $6.4 billion in 2015 to $3.6 billion in 2016.Excluding the adjustments to operating income in both years reflected in the tables on page 44, adjusted operating income was $2.9 billion in 2016 compared to $7.1 billion in 2015. Details regarding the $4.3 billion decrease in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below.Income tax expense decreased $1.1 billion from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to lower income before income tax expense. Excluding the income tax adjustments reflected in the table on page 44 from both years, the effective tax rate for 2016 was 26 percent compared to 30 percent in 2015. The effective tax rates are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily because income from our international operations was taxed at statutory rates that were lower than in the U.S. The effective tax rate in 2016 was lower than the 2015 rate due to a benefit of $35 million resulting from the favorable resolution of an income tax audit.Refining Segment ResultsRefining segment operating revenues decreased $12.6 billion and cost of materials and other decreased $8.1 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to decreases in refined petroleum product prices and crude oil feedstock costs, respectively. The resulting $4.4 billion decrease in refining segment margin was partially offset by the positive effect from the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments in both years, resulting in a decrease in operating income of $3.1 billion, from $6.9 billion in 2015 to $3.8 billion in 2016.Excluding the adjustments reflected in the tables on page 44 from operating income in both years, adjusted operating income was $3.1 billion in 2016 compared to $7.6 billion in 2015, a decrease of $4.5 billion. The components of this decrease are outlined below, along with the reasons for the changes in these components between the years.Refining segment margin decreased $4.4 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, as previously noted, primarily due to the following:•Decrease in gasoline margins. We experienced a decrease in gasoline margins throughout all our regions in 2016 compared to 2015. For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent CBOB gasoline was $11.82 per barrel in 2016 compared to $17.59 per barrel in 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $5.77 per barrel. Another example is the ANS-based reference margin for U.S. West Coast CARBOB 87 gasoline, which was $17.04 per barrel in 2016 compared to $25.56 per barrel in 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $8.52 per barrel. We estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $1.7 billion. •Decrease in distillate margins. We also experienced a decrease in distillate margins throughout all our regions in 2016 compared to 2015. For example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel was $10.21 per barrel in 2016 compared to $12.64 per barrel in 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $2.43 per barrel. Another example is the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low-sulfur diesel that was $13.03 per barrel in 2016 compared to $19.02 per barrel in 2015, representing an unfavorable 51Table of Contentsdecrease of $5.99 per barrel. We estimate that the decrease in distillate margins per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $1.6 billion.•Lower discounts on light sweet and sour crude oils. The market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, and we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. During 2016, we benefited from processing WTI crude oil (a type of sweet crude oil), however, that benefit declined compared to 2015. For example, WTI crude oil processed in our U.S. Mid-Continent region sold at a discount of $1.83 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2016 compared to a discount of $4.91 per barrel in 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $3.08 per barrel. Another example is Maya crude oil (a type of sour crude oil) that sold at a discount of $8.63 per barrel to Brent crude oil in 2016 compared to a discount of $9.54 per barrel in 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $0.91 per barrel. We estimate that the reduction in the discounts for light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils that we processed in 2016 had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $900 million.•Higher costs of biofuel credits. As more fully described in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we must purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending obligation under various government and regulatory compliance programs, and the cost of these credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) increased by $309 million from $440 million in 2015 to $749 million in 2016.•Increase in charges from VLP. Charges from the VLP segment for transportation and terminaling services increased $119 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to additional services provided to the refining segment using terminals acquired by VLP in 2015 and 2016. The increase in charges from VLP are more fully discussed in the VLP segment analysis below.•Higher throughput volumes. Refining throughput volumes increased by 56,000 BPD in 2016. We estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes had a positive impact on our refining segment margin of approximately $175 million.Refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased $35 million primarily due to an increase in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense resulting from the completion of turnaround projects at several of our refineries in 2016.Ethanol Segment ResultsEthanol segment operating revenues increased $467 million and cost of materials and other increased $386 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in ethanol production and sales volumes. The resulting $81 million increase in ethanol segment margin, along with the positive effect from the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments in both years, resulted in an increase in operating income of $198 million, from $142 million in 2015 to $340 million in 2016. Excluding the adjustments reflected in the tables on page 44 from both years, adjusted operating income was $290 million in 2016 compared to $192 million in 2015, an increase of $98 million. The components of this increase are outlined below, along with the reasons for the changes in these components between the years.52Table of ContentsEthanol segment margin increased $81 million in 2016 compared to 2015, as previously noted, primarily due to the following:•Lower corn prices. Corn prices were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher yields from the corn crop in the corn-producing regions of the U.S. Mid-Continent in 2016. For example, the CBOT corn price was $3.58 per bushel in 2016 compared to $3.77 per bushel in 2015. We estimate that the decrease in the price of corn that we processed during 2016 had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $105 million.•Higher ethanol prices. Ethanol prices were slightly higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased ethanol demand. Despite higher domestic production during 2016, inventory levels declined during the year primarily due to higher exports. For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $1.60 per gallon in 2016 compared to $1.59 per gallon in 2015. We estimate that the increase in the price of ethanol per gallon in 2016 had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $24 million.•Higher production volumes. Ethanol segment margin was favorably impacted by increased production volumes of 15,000 gallons per day in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to improved operating efficiencies and mechanical reliability. We estimate that the increase in production volumes had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $22 million.•Lower co-product prices. A decrease in export demand for corn related co-products, primarily distillers grains, had an unfavorable effect on the prices we received. We estimate that the decrease in corn related co-product prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $70 million.Ethanol segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) decreased $33 million primarily due to a $14 million decrease in energy costs related to lower natural gas prices ($2.46 per MMBtu in 2016 compared to $2.58 per MMBtu in 2015) and a $15 million decrease in chemical costs.Ethanol segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased $16 million primarily due to a $10 million gain on the sale of certain plant assets in 2015 that was reflected in depreciation and amortization expense thereby reducing depreciation and amortization expense in 2015.VLP Segment ResultsVLP segment operating revenues increased $119 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to incremental revenues generated from transportation and terminaling services provided to our refining segment associated with terminals acquired in 2015 and 2016. This increase in VLP segment revenues, along with a decrease in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) between the years, resulted in an increase in operating income of $129 million, from $92 million in 2015 to $221 million in 2016. The components of this increase are outlined below, along with the reasons for the changes in these components between the years.VLP revenues increased $119 million in 2016 compared to 2015, as previously noted, primarily due to the following:•Incremental throughput from acquired businesses. VLP generated incremental terminaling revenues of $124 million from services provided to the refining segment by the McKee , Meraux, and Three 53Table of ContentsRivers terminals, which were acquired by VLP in 2016, and the St. Charles, Houston, and Corpus Christi terminals which were acquired by VLP in 2015. •Lower throughput at systems owned or acquired prior to 2015. VLP experienced a decrease in throughput volumes, primarily at the Port Arthur logistics system as a result of planned turnaround activity at the Port Arthur Refinery and at the McKee crude system as a result of decreased crude oil production in the Texas panhandle. The decrease in throughput volumes at these systems had an unfavorable impact to VLP’s operating revenues of $5 million.VLP segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) decreased $10 million primarily due to lower maintenance expense at the Corpus Christi terminal related to inspection activity in 2015.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2017Our operations generated $5.5 billion of cash in 2017. Net income of $4.2 billion, net of the $1.9 billion noncash benefit from Tax Reform and other noncash charges of $2.1 billion, and a positive change in working capital of $1.3 billion were the primary drivers of the cash generated by our operations in 2017. Other noncash charges included $2.0 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. (See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations.) The Tax Reform benefit and the change in our working capital are further detailed in Notes 14 and 17, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The source of cash resulting from the $1.3 billion change in working capital was mainly due to:•an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in receivables, primarily as a result of an increase in commodity prices;•an increase in income taxes payable resulting from deferring the payment of our fourth quarter 2017 estimated taxes to January 2018, as allowed by tax relief authorization from the IRS; and•an increase in inventory due to higher volumes held combined with an increase in commodity prices.The $5.5 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with borrowings of $380 million under a $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the VLP Revolver) as discussed in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, were used mainly to:•fund $2.3 billion in capital investments,which include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and investments in joint ventures;•acquire an undivided interest in crude system assets for $72 million;•purchase common stock for treasury of $1.4 billion;•pay common stock dividends of $1.2 billion;•pay distributions to noncontrolling interests of $67 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $1.0 billion.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2016Our operations generated $4.8 billion of cash in 2016, driven primarily by net income of $2.4 billion, net noncash charges to income of $1.4 billion, and positive change in working capital of $976 million. Noncash charges included $1.9 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $56 million for the asset impairment loss associated with our Aruba Terminal, and $230 million of deferred income tax expense, partially offset by a benefit of $747 million from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment. (See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations.) The change in our working capital is further 54Table of Contentsdetailed in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The source of cash resulting from the $976 million change in working capital was mainly due to:•an increase in accounts payable, offset by an increase in receivables, primarily as a result of higher commodity prices;•a reduction of our inventories; and•a reduction in prepaid expenses and other related to income taxes receivable due to utilization in 2016 of our 2015 overpayment of taxes.The $4.8 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with $2.2 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt (including $1.25 billion of 3.4 percent Senior Notes due September 15, 2026, $500 million of 4.375 percent Senior Notes due December 15, 2026 issued by VLP, and borrowings under the VLP Revolver of $349 million as discussed in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), were used mainly to:•fund $2.0 billion in capital investments, which include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and investments in joint ventures;•redeem our 6.125 percent Senior Notes for $778 million (or 103.70 percent of stated value) and our 7.2 percent Senior Notes for $213 million (or 106.27 percent of stated value);•make payments on debt and capital lease obligations of $525 million, of which $494 million related to borrowings under the VLP Revolver, $9 million related to capital lease obligations, and $22 million related to other non-bank debt;•pay off a long-term liability of $137 million owed to a joint venture partner for an owner-method joint venture investment;•purchase common stock for treasury of $1.3 billion;•pay common stock dividends of $1.1 billion;•pay distributions to noncontrolling interests of $65 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $702 million.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2015Our operations generated $5.6 billion of cash in 2015, driven primarily by net income of $4.1 billion and noncash charges to income of $2.8 billion. Noncash charges included $1.8 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $790 million from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, and $165 million of deferred income tax expense. (See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations.) However, the change in our working capital during the year had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of $1.3 billion as shown in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This use of cash mainly resulted from:•a decrease in accounts payable, net of a decrease in receivables, primarily as a result of a decrease in commodity prices from December 2014 to December 2015;•an increase in prepaid expenses and other related to income taxes receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable due to tax payments associated with the settlement of several IRS audits and an overpayment of taxes in 2015. This overpayment resulted from a change in the U.S. Federal tax laws late in the year that reinstated the bonus depreciation deduction, which lowered our current income tax expense; and•an increase in inventories, mainly due to the build in inventory volumes from 2015 as we purchased crude oil at prices we deemed favorable during the fourth quarter of 2015.55Table of ContentsThe $5.6 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with (i) $1.45 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt and (ii) net proceeds of $189 million from VLP’s public offering of 4,250,000 common units as discussed in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, were used mainly to:•fund $2.4 billion in capital investments, which include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and investments in joint ventures;•make payments on debt and capital lease obligations of $513 million, of which $400 million related to our 4.5 percent Senior Notes, $75 million related to our 8.75 percent debentures, $25 million related to the VLP Revolver, $10 million related to capital lease obligations, and $3 million related to other non-bank debt;•purchase common stock for treasury of $2.8 billion;•pay common stock dividends of $848 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $425 million.Capital InvestmentsWe define capital investments as capital expenditures for purchases of, additions to, and improvements in our property, plant, and equipment, and turnaround and catalyst costs; and investments in joint ventures.Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are improved continuously. The cost of improvements, which consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, can be significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly.For 2018, we expect to incur approximately $2.7 billion for capital investments, but we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. This capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions, including acquisitions of undivided interests.We consolidate the financial statements of VIEs if we are the primary beneficiary of their operations, even though we may have no ownership interest in them. Because we consolidate the financial statements of these entities, our financial statements reflect the capital expenditures they make. Our statements of cash flows separately reflect the capital expenditures made by these entities (along with an equal offset of these amounts included in contributions from noncontrolling interests within financing activities) and these expenditures are not included in our $2.7 billion estimate of 2018 capital investments. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our VIEs.56Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 are summarized below (in millions).

Capital lease obligations include related interest expense. Our debt and capital lease obligations are further described in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Debt and Capital Lease ObligationsOur debt and capital lease obligations are described in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. All of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: RatingRating Agency Valero VLPMoody’s Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook) Baa3 (stable outlook)Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook) BBB- (stable outlook)Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook) BBB- (stable outlook)We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.Operating Lease ObligationsOur operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks, refined petroleum products, and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, 57Table of Contentsor variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminaling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the preceding table include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions.Other Long-term LiabilitiesOur other long-term liabilities are described in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the preceding table, we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2017.Summary of Credit FacilitiesInformation about our outstanding borrowings, letters of credit issued, and availability under our credit facilities is reflected in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Purchase ProgramsOn September 21, 2016, our board of directors authorized our purchase of up to an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common stock with no expiration date. This authorization was in addition to the remaining amount available under the 2015 program. During the first quarter of 2017, we completed our purchases under the 2015 program. As of December 31, 2017, we had $1.2 billion remaining available for purchase under the 2016 program. We have no obligation to make purchases under this program. On January 23, 2018, our board of directors authorized our purchase of up to an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common stock with no expiration date.Pension Plan FundingWe plan to contribute approximately $131 million to our pension plans, including discretionary contributions of $100 million, and $19 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2018.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Notes 7 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters.58Table of ContentsTax MattersThe IRS has ongoing audits related to our U.S. federal income tax returns from 2010 through 2015, and we have received Revenue Agent Reports (RARs) in connection with the 2010 and 2011 audit. We are contesting certain tax positions and assertions included in the RARs and continue to make progress in resolving certain of these matters with the IRS. We believe that the ultimate settlement of these audits will not be material to our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.Cash Held by Our International SubsidiariesIn conjunction with our implementation of the provisions under Tax Reform, which was enacted on December 22, 2017 and is more fully described in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded a liability in 2017 for the estimated U.S. federal tax due on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings and profits of our international subsidiaries not previously distributed to us, and we will pay this liability over the eight-year period permitted by the provisions under Tax Reform. Because of the deemed repatriation of these accumulated earnings and profits, there are no longer any U.S. federal income tax consequences associated with the repatriation of any of the $3.2 billion of cash and temporary cash investments held by our international subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. However, certain countries in which our international subsidiaries are organized impose withholding taxes on cash distributed outside of those countries. We have accrued for withholding taxes on a portion of the cash held by one of our international subsidiaries that we have deemed to not be permanently reinvested in our operations in that country.Cash provided by operating activities in the U.S. continues to be our primary source of funds to finance our U.S. operations and capital expenditures, as well as our dividends and share repurchases.Concentration of CustomersOur operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.Sources of LiquidityWe believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAs discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements became effective January 1, 2018, or will become effective in the future. The effect on our financial statements upon adoption of these pronouncements is discussed in the above-referenced note.59Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes.Inventory ValuationThe cost of our inventories is principally determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using the dollar-value LIFO approach. Our LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value and our non-LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The market value of our LIFO inventories is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories.We compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis, excluding materials and supplies. In determining the market value of our inventories, we assume our refinery and ethanol feedstocks are converted into refined products, which requires us to make estimates regarding the refined products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined products. We also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our refineries and ethanol plants to the appropriate points of sale. We then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories. If the aggregate market value is less than cost, we recognize a loss for the difference in our statements of income.The lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies.The amount of our accruals for environmental matters as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.60Table of ContentsPension and Other Postretirement Benefit ObligationsWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are disclosed and described in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we utilized a forward-looking model of asset returns. The historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to December 31, 2017 was 6.29 percent. The actual return on assets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was 19.31 percent, 7.77 percent, and 1.46 percent, respectively. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements. For example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2018 (in millions): Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefitsIncrease in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease$129 $9Compensation rate increase15 n/aHealth care cost trend rate increasen/a 1Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease12 1Expected return on plan assets decrease6 n/aCompensation rate increase4 n/aHealth care cost trend rate increasen/a —Beginning in 2016, our net periodic benefit cost is determined using the spot-rate approach. Under this approach, our net periodic benefit cost is impacted by the spot rates of the corporate bond yield curve used to calculate our liability discount rate. If the yield curve were to flatten entirely and our liability discount rate remained unchanged, our net periodic benefit cost would increase by $12 million for pension benefits and $2 million for other postretirement benefits in 2018.See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.Tax MattersWe record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to an indirect tax (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and/or value-added tax) claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different determinations of the amount of tax due, 61Table of Contentsincluding penalties and interest. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of a valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised.In addition, because of the significant and complex changes to the Code from Tax Reform, including the need for regulatory guidance from the IRS to properly account for many of the changes, we recorded income taxes for items where reasonable estimates could be made and we applied the Code on a pre-Tax Reform basis for items where reasonable estimates could not be made, as permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, “Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” issued by the SEC. As a result, we will record the effect in 2018 for items where we were unable to make a reasonable estimate in 2017, and we may revise estimates that were recorded in 2017. These amounts could be material. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities and the impact from Tax Reform on those liabilities.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined petroleum products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), soybean oil, and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to manage the volatility of:•inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a LIFO basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels and•forecasted feedstock and refined petroleum product purchases, refined petroleum product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable.We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our price risk activities. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows.Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.62Table of ContentsThe following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): Derivative Instruments Held For Non-Trading Purposes TradingPurposesDecember 31, 2017: Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices$(47) $410% decrease in underlying commodity prices47 (2) December 31, 2016: Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices61 (22)10% decrease in underlying commodity prices(61) 11See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2017.COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits and GHG emission credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs. To manage these risks, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. As of December 31, 2017, there was an immaterial amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs.63Table of ContentsINTEREST RATE RISKThe following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” included in this report.CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995This report, including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK,” includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “scheduled,” “estimate,” “project,” “projection,” “predict,” “budget,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “target,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “will,” “may,” and similar expressions.These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding:•future refining segment margins, including gasoline and distillate margins;•future ethanol segment margins;•expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil differentials, and operating expenses;•anticipated levels of crude oil and refined petroleum product inventories;•our anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred costs for refinery turnarounds and catalyst, capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and joint venture investments, and the effect of those capital investments on our results of operations;•anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products in the regions where we operate, as well as globally;•expectations regarding environmental, tax, and other regulatory initiatives; and•the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining, ethanol, and midstream industry fundamentals.We based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following:•acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined petroleum products or receive feedstocks;•political and economic conditions in nations that produce crude oil or consume refined petroleum products;•demand for, and supplies of, refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, and ethanol;•demand for, and supplies of, crude oil and other feedstocks;•the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls;•the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations;25Table of Contents•refinery overcapacity or undercapacity;•our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations;•the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and adjustments to refining capacity in response to market conditions;•the level of competitors’ imports into markets that we supply;•accidents, unscheduled shutdowns, or other catastrophes affecting our refineries, machinery, pipelines, equipment, and information systems, or those of our suppliers or customers;•changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined petroleum products;•the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles;•the levels of government subsidies for alternative fuels;•the volatility in the market price of biofuel credits (primarily RINs needed to comply with the RFS) and GHG emission credits needed to comply with the requirements of various GHG emission programs;•delay of, cancellation of, or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects;•earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil, grain and other feedstocks, and refined petroleum products and ethanol;•rulings, judgments, or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs, in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage;•legislative or regulatory action, including the introduction or enactment of legislation or rulemakings by governmental authorities, including tariffs and tax and environmental regulations, such as those implemented under the California cap-and-trade system (also known as AB 32) and similar programs, and the U.S. EPA’s regulation of GHGs, which may adversely affect our business or operations;•changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and trade credit;•changes in currency exchange rates, including the value of the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling, the euro, the Mexican peso, and the Peruvian sol relative to the U.S. dollar;•overall economic conditions, including the stability and liquidity of financial markets; and•other factors generally described in the “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this report.Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so.All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.This report includes references to financial measures that are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders, adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments), and refining and ethanol segment margin. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between years. See the accompanying financial tables in “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” and note (h) to the accompanying tables for reconciliations of 26Table of Contentsthese non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Also in note (h), we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information.OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOKOverviewFor 2018, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $3.1 billion compared to $4.1 billion for 2017, which represents a decrease of $943 million. This decrease is primarily due to a $1.9 billion tax benefit in 2017 resulting from Tax Reform, which is discussed in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by a $1.0 billion increase in income before income tax expense. The increase in income before income tax expense is primarily due to higher operating income between the years as described below.Operating income was $4.6 billion for 2018 compared to $3.6 billion for 2017, which represents an increase of $1.0 billion. Excluding the adjustments to operating income reflected in the tables on page 32, adjusted operating income increased by $931 million in 2018 compared to 2017.The $931 million increase in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the following:•Refining segment. Refining segment adjusted operating income increased $961 million primarily due to improved distillate margins, favorable crude oil discounts, and lower costs of biofuel credits, partially offset by lower gasoline margins. This is more fully described on pages 36 through 37.•Ethanol segment. Ethanol segment operating income decreased by $90 million primarily due to lower ethanol prices and higher corn prices, partially offset by higher corn related co-products prices. This is more fully described on pages 37 through 38.•VLP segment. VLP segment adjusted operating income increased by $50 million primarily due to incremental revenues, partially offset by higher cost of sales, generated from transportation and terminaling services associated with a terminal and a product pipeline system acquired by VLP in November 2017 that were formerly a part of the refining segment. This is more fully described on page 38.•Corporate and eliminations. Adjusted corporate and eliminations decreased by $10 million primarily due to expenses in 2017 associated with the termination of the acquisition of certain assets from Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (Plains). This is more fully described on page 38.Additional details and analysis for the changes in operating income and adjusted operating income for our reportable business segments and other components of net income and adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this Overview to their most comparable measures reported under U.S. GAAP, are provided below under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS”.27Table of ContentsOutlookBelow are several factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2019:•Refining and ethanol margins are expected to remain near current levels. •Medium and heavy sour crude oil discounts are expected to remain weaker than their five-year averages as supplies of sour crude oils available in the market remain suppressed.•Sweet crude oil discounts are expected to remain near current levels as export demand remains strong and freight costs continue to rise. U.S. inland sweet crude oil discounts are also expected to remain wide with higher production and limited pipeline capacity to transport crude oil out of the Permian Basin and other producing regions in the U.S.•Our refining operations in the U.K. could be adversely affected by Brexit, which is currently scheduled to occur on March 29, 2019. The U.K. and the European Union have yet to finalize the terms of Brexit, and the U.K.’s exit from the European Union without an agreement on an overall structure for an ongoing relationship with the European Union could result in the imposition of border controls and customs duties on trade that could negatively impact the operations of our Pembroke Refinery. While we do not believe that Brexit will have a material impact on us, we are taking steps to minimize the impact of possible delays on importing certain materials critical to our refining operations. The ultimate effect of Brexit will depend on the specific terms of any agreement reached by the U.K. and the European Union. See Item 1A “Risk Factors”—Changes in the U.K.’s economic and other relationships with the European Union could adversely affect us.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market reference prices that directly impact our operations. In addition, these tables include financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and represent non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and include adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders, adjusted operating income, and refining and ethanol segment margin. In note (h) to these tables, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information.On January 10, 2019, we completed our acquisition of all the outstanding publicly held common units of VLP pursuant to the Merger Agreement with VLP as defined and discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon completion of the Merger Transaction, VLP became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Valero.28Table of Contents2018 Compared to 2017Financial Highlights by Segment and Total Company(millions

Harbor corn crush (dollars per gallon)0.15 0.26 (0.11)35Table of ContentsTotal Company, Corporate, and OtherRevenues increased $23.1 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices associated with sales made by our refining segment. This improvement in revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $22 billion primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, and an increase of $96 million in general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), resulting in an increase in operating income of $1.0 billion in 2018 compared to 2017.Excluding the adjustments to operating income reflected in the tables on page 32, adjusted operating income increased by $931 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Details regarding the $931 million increase in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below. Other income, net increased $18 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher equity in earnings associated with our Diamond pipeline joint venture of $39 million and higher interest income of $29 million, partially offset by a $38 million charge from the early redemption of debt as described in note (c) to the accompanying tables (see page 45).Income tax expense increased $1.8 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the effect from a $1.9 billion income tax benefit in 2017 resulting from Tax Reform, which is described in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the income tax adjustments reflected in the table on page 31 from both years, the effective tax rate for 2018 was 22 percent compared to 28 percent for 2017. The decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018 as a result of Tax Reform. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $140 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher earnings associated with DGD, our consolidated joint venture, which includes a benefit of $80 million for the blender’s tax credit, as described in note (a) to the accompanying tables (see page 45).Refining Segment ResultsRefining segment revenues increased $23.0 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices. This improvement in refining segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $21.8 billion due primarily to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, resulting in an increase in refining segment operating income of $1.1 billion in 2018 compared to 2017.Excluding the adjustments to refining segment operating income reflected in the tables on page 32, refining segment adjusted operating income increased by $961 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The components of this increase, along with reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below. Refining segment margin, as defined in note (h) to the accompanying tables (see page 46), increased $1.2 billion in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the following:•Increase in distillate margins. We experienced improved distillate margins throughout all of our regions in 2018 compared to 2017. For example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel was $14.02 per barrel for 2018 compared to $13.26 per barrel for 2017, representing a favorable increase of $0.76 per barrel. Another example is the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low-sulfur diesel that was $22.82 per barrel for 2018 compared to $18.50 per barrel for 2017, representing a favorable increase of $4.32 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in distillate margins per barrel in 2018 compared to 2017 had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $1.3 billion.36Table of Contents•Higher discounts on crude oils. The market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, and we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. We benefitted from processing these types of crude oils in 2018 and that benefit improved compared to 2017. For example, WTI crude oil, a light sweet crude oil, sold at a discount to Brent of $6.71 per barrel for 2018 compared to a discount of $3.92 per barrel for 2017, representing a favorable increase of $2.79 per barrel. Another example is Maya crude oil, a sour crude oil processed in our U.S. Gulf Coast region, which sold at a discount to Brent of $9.22 per barrel for 2018 compared to $7.74 per barrel for 2017, representing a favorable increase of $1.48 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in the discounts for crude oils that we processed during 2018 compared to 2017 had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $561 million.•Lower costs of biofuel credits. As described in Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending obligation under various government and regulatory compliance programs. The cost of these credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) was $536 million in 2018 compared to $942 million in 2017, a decrease of $406 million.•Higher throughput volumes. Refining segment throughput volumes increased by 46,000 BPD in 2018. We estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes had a positive impact on our refining segment margin of approximately $153 million.•Decrease in gasoline margins. We experienced a decrease in gasoline margins throughout all of our regions in 2018 compared to 2017. For example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast CBOB gasoline was $4.81 per barrel for 2018 compared to $10.50 per barrel for 2017, representing an unfavorable decrease of $5.69 per barrel. Another example is the ANS-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. West Coast CARBOB 87 gasoline, which was $13.05 per barrel for 2018 compared to $18.12 per barrel for 2017, representing an unfavorable decrease of $5.07 per barrel. We estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins per barrel in 2018 compared to 2017 had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $1.3 billion.Refining segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased $140 million primarily due to higher employee-related expenses of $33 million, an increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices ($3.23 per MMBtu in 2018 compared to $2.98 per MMBtu in 2017) of $28 million, higher chemicals and catalyst costs of $24 million, the effect from a favorable insurance settlement of $20 million in 2017 for our McKee Refinery, and higher maintenance expense of $12 million.Refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased $63 million due to an increase in refinery turnaround amortization expense of $41 million primarily due to costs incurred in the latter part of 2017 and early 2018 in connection with significant turnaround projects at our Corpus Christi and McKee Refineries, along with the write-off of assets that were idled or demolished in 2018 of $15 million.Ethanol Segment ResultsEthanol segment revenues increased $138 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in ethanol sales volumes and increases in corn related co-product prices along with the revenue contribution associated with three ethanol plants acquired from Green Plains, Inc. (Green Plains) on November 15, 2018, which is described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This increase is partially offset by lower ethanol prices. This improvement in ethanol segment revenue was more than offset by higher cost of sales of $228 million primarily due to higher corn prices, resulting in a decrease in ethanol segment 37Table of Contentsoperating income of $90 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The components of this decrease, along with reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.Ethanol segment margin, as defined in note (h) to the accompanying tables (see page 46), decreased $66 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the following:•Lower ethanol prices. Ethanol prices were lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in production. For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $1.48 per gallon for 2018 compared to $1.56 per gallon for 2017, representing an unfavorable decrease of $0.08 per gallon. We estimate that the decrease in the price of ethanol had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $159 million.•Higher corn prices. Corn prices were higher in 2018 compared to 2017. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) corn price was $3.68 per bushel for 2018 compared to $3.59 per bushel for 2017, representing an unfavorable increase of $0.09 per bushel. We estimate that the increase in the price of corn had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $36 million.•Higher co-product prices. An increase in protein values, as compared to soybean meal, had a favorable effect on the prices received for the corn related co-products that we produced. We estimate the increase in corn related co-product prices had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $101 million.•Higher production volumes. Ethanol segment margin was favorably impacted by increased production volumes of 137,000 gallons per day in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to reliability improvements at our ethanol plants and the additional production volumes associated with the three plants acquired from Green Plains in November 2018. We estimate that the increase in production volumes had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $26 million.Ethanol segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased $27 million primarily due to costs to operate the three plants acquired from Green Plains in November 2018 of $14 million, coupled with higher chemicals and catalysts expenses of $8 million.VLP Segment ResultsVLP segment revenues increased $94 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to $75 million of incremental revenues generated from transportation and terminaling services associated with the Port Arthur terminal and the Parkway pipeline acquired by VLP in November 2017 that were formerly a part of the refining segment. The increase in VLP segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $44 million primarily due to the costs to operate the acquired terminal and pipeline, resulting in an increase in VLP segment operating income of $53 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Excluding the adjustment reflected in the table on page 32, VLP adjusted operating income increased $50 million.Corporate and EliminationsCorporate and eliminations, which consists primarily of general and administrative expenses and related depreciation and amortization expense, increased by $98 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Excluding the environmental reserve adjustments of $108 million from 2018 reflected in the table on page 32, adjusted corporate and eliminations decreased by $10 million in 2018 primarily due to the effect from expenses incurred in 2017 associated with the termination of the acquisition of certain assets from Plains.38Table of Contents2017 Compared to 2016Financial Highlights by Segment and Total

benefit of $170 million for the biodiesel blender’s tax credit attributable to volumes blended during 2017. The benefit was recognized in February 2018 because the legislation authorizing the credit was passed and signed into law in that month. The $170 million pre-tax benefit is included in the refining segment and includes $80 million attributable to noncontrolling interest and $90 million attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders. (b)General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a charge of $108 million for an environmental reserve adjustment associated with certain non-operating sites. (c)Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a $38 million charge from the early redemption of $750 million of our 9.375 percent senior notes due March 15, 2019.(d)On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was enacted, resulting in the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred taxes and the recognition of a liability for taxes on the deemed repatriation of our foreign earnings and profits. In addition, Tax Reform lowered the U.S. statutory income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, beginning January 1, 2018. Under U.S. GAAP we are required to recognize the effect of Tax Reform in the period of enactment. As a result, we recognized a $1.9 billion income tax benefit in December 2017, which represented our initial estimate of the impact of Tax Reform in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118). We finalized our estimates in December 2018 and have recorded an additional benefit of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. (e)Excluding the income tax benefits discussed in note (d) from both years and the other adjustments to income tax reflected in the table on page 31 from 2018, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 22 percent and 28 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective rate is primarily due to the decline in the U.S. statutory income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent as a result of Tax Reform (see note (d)).(f)In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market. When the market price of our inventory falls below cost, we record a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment to write down the value to market. In subsequent periods, the value of our inventory is reassessed and a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment is recorded to reflect the net change in the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve between the periods. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the market price of our inventory was above cost; therefore we did not have a lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve as of those dates. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in our inventory valuation reserve that was established on December 31, 2015, resulting in a noncash benefit of $747 million, of which $697 million and $50 million were attributable to our refining segment and ethanol segment, respectively.(g)Effective October 1, 2016 we (i) transferred ownership of all our assets in Aruba, other than certain hydrocarbon inventories and working capital, to Refineria di Aruba N.V. (RDA), an entity wholly-owned by the Government of Aruba (GOA), (ii) settled our obligations under various agreements with the GOA, including agreements that required us to dismantle our leasehold improvements under certain conditions, and (iii) sold the working capital of our Aruba operations, including hydrocarbon inventories, to the GOA, CITGO Aruba Refining N.V. (CAR), and CITGO Petroleum Corporation (together with CAR and certain other affiliates, collectively, CITGO). We refer to this transaction as the “Aruba Disposition.”In June 2016, we recognized an asset impairment loss of $56 million representing all of the remaining carrying value of the long-lived assets of our crude oil and refined petroleum products terminal and transshipment facility in Aruba (collectively, the Aruba Terminal). We recognized the impairment loss at that time because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would ultimately transfer ownership of these assets to the GOA as a result of agreements entered into in June 2016 between the GOA and CITGO for the GOA’s lease of those assets to CITGO.45Table of ContentsIn September 2016 and in connection with the Aruba Disposition, our U.S. subsidiaries cancelled all outstanding debt obligations owed to them by our Aruba subsidiaries, which resulted in the recognition by us of an income tax benefit of $42 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.(h)We use certain financial measures (as noted below) that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures.We have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes the utility of these measures.Non-GAAP measures are as follows:◦Adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders is defined as net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders excluding the items noted below, along with their related income tax effect. We have excluded these items because we believe that they are not indicative of our core operating performance and that their exclusion results in an important measure of our ongoing financial performance to better assess our underlying business results and trends. The basis for our belief with respect to each excluded item is provided below.–Blender’s tax credit attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders - The blender’s tax credit is attributable to volumes blended during 2017 and is not related to 2018 activities, as described in note (a).–Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment - The noncash benefit recorded during 2016 to adjust our inventory valuation reserve, as described in note (f).–Asset impairment loss - The impairment loss of $56 million in 2016 associated with the Aruba Disposition, as described in note (g).–Texas City Refinery fire expenses - The costs incurred to respond to and assess the damage caused by the fire that occurred at the Texas City Refinery on April 19, 2018 are specific to that event and are not ongoing costs incurred in our operations.–Environmental reserve adjustments - The environmental reserve adjustments are attributable to sites that were shut down by prior owners and subsequently acquired by us (referred to by us as non-operating sites), as described in note (b).–Loss on early redemption of debt - The penalty and other expenses incurred in connection with the early redemption of our 9.375 percent senior notes due March 15, 2019 (see note (c)) are not associated with the ongoing costs of our borrowing and financing activities.–Income tax benefit from Tax Reform - Income tax benefit from Tax Reform (see note (d)) is associated with changes in U.S. tax legislation and is not indicative of our core performance.–Income tax benefit from Aruba Disposition - The income tax benefit in 2016 resulting from the cancellation of outstanding debt obligations associated with the Aruba Disposition, as described in note (g).◦Refining margin is defined as refining operating income excluding the blender’s tax credit, the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, the asset impairment loss, operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), other operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense, as reflected in the table below. ◦Ethanol margin is defined as ethanol operating income excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), and depreciation and amortization expense, as reflected in the table below.46Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Reconciliation of refining segment operating income to refining margin Operating income$5,119 $3,975 $3,730Add back: Blender’s tax credit (a)(170) — —Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment (f)— — (697)Asset impairment loss (g)— — 56Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)4,099 3,959 3,740Depreciation and amortization expense1,863 1,800 1,734Other operating expenses45 58 —Refining margin$10,956$9,792 $8,563 Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Reconciliation of ethanol segment operating income to ethanol margin Operating income$82 $172 $340Add back: Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment (f)— — (50)Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)470 443 415Depreciation and amortization expense78 81 66Ethanol margin$630 $696 $771◦Adjusted refining operating income is defined as refining segment operating income excluding the blender’s tax credit, lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, asset impairment loss, and other operating expenses.◦Adjusted ethanol operating income is defined as ethanol segment operating income excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment.◦Adjusted VLP operating income is defined as VLP segment operating income excluding other operating expenses.◦Adjusted corporate and eliminations is defined as corporate and eliminations excluding the environmental reserve adjustments associated with certain non-operating sites (see note (b)).(i)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.(j)Valero uses certain operating statistics (as noted below) to evaluate performance between comparable periods. Different companies may calculate them in different ways. Refining segment margin per barrel of throughput and adjusted refining segment operating income per barrel of throughput represents refining segment margin and adjusted refining segment operating income (each as defined in note (h) above) divided by the respective throughput volumes. Ethanol segment margin per gallon of production and adjusted ethanol segment operating income per gallon of production represent ethanol segment margin and 47Table of Contentsadjusted ethanol segment operating income (each as defined in note (h) above) divided by production volumes. Pipeline transportation revenue per barrel of throughput and terminaling revenue per barrel of throughput represent pipeline transportation revenue and terminaling revenue for our VLP segment divided by pipeline transportation throughput and terminaling throughput volumes, respectively. Throughput and production volumes are calculated by multiplying production throughput and production volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables) by the number of days in the applicable period.Total Company, Corporate, and OtherRevenues increased $18.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum products prices associated with sales made by our refining segment. This improvement in revenues was mostly offset by higher cost of sales of $18.2 billion primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, and an increase of $120 million in general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), resulting in an increase in operating income of $29 million in 2017 compared to 2016.Excluding the adjustments to operating income reflected in the tables on page 41, adjusted operating income increased by $781 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Details regarding the $781 million increase in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below.Income tax expense decreased $1.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the effect from a $1.9 billion income tax benefit in 2017 resulting from Tax Reform, which is described in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the income tax adjustments reflected in the table on page 41 from both years, the effective tax rate for 2017 was 28 percent compared to 26 percent for 2016. The effective tax rates are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent that was in effect through December 31, 2017, primarily because income from our international operations was taxed at statutory rates that were lower than in the U.S. The effective tax rate for 2016 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2017 due to a benefit in 2016 of $35 million resulting from the favorable resolution of an income tax audit.Refining Segment ResultsRefining segment revenues increased $18.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices. This improvement in refining segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $18.4 million primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, resulting in an increase in operating income of $245 million in 2017 compared to 2016.Excluding the adjustments to refining segment operating income reflected in the tables on page 41, refining segment adjusted operating income increased by $944 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The components of this increase, along with the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.Refining segment margin, as defined in note (h) to the accompanying tables (see page 46), increased $1.2 billion, primarily due to the following:•Increase in distillate margins. We experienced improved distillate margins throughout all our regions in 2017 compared to 2016. For example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel was $13.26 per barrel for 2017 compared to $10.21 per barrel for 2016, representing a favorable increase of $3.05 per barrel. Another example is the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low-sulfur diesel that was $18.50 per barrel for 2017 compared to $13.03 per barrel for 2016, representing a favorable increase of $5.47 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in distillate margins per barrel in 2017 compared to 2016 had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $1.2 billion.48Table of Contents•Increase in gasoline margins. We also experienced improved gasoline margins throughout all our regions in 2017 compared to 2016. For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent CBOB gasoline was $15.65 per barrel for 2017 compared to $11.82 per barrel for 2016, representing a favorable increase of $3.83 per barrel. Another example is the Brent-based reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast CBOB gasoline, which was $10.50 per barrel for 2017 compared to $9.17 per barrel for 2016, representing a favorable increase of $1.33 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in gasoline margins per barrel in 2017 compared to 2016 had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $577 million.•Higher throughput volumes. Refining segment throughput volumes increased by 85,000 BPD in 2017. We estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes had a positive impact on our refining segment margin of approximately $283 million.•Lower discounts on sour crude oils. The market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, and we benefit when we process sour crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. While we benefitted from processing these sour crude oils in 2017, that benefit declined compared to 2016. For example, ASCI crude oil processed in our U.S. Gulf Coast region sold at a discount to Brent of $4.18 per barrel for 2017 compared to a discount of $5.18 per barrel for 2016, representing an unfavorable decrease of $1.00 per barrel. Another example is Maya crude oil which sold at a discount to Brent of $7.74 per barrel for 2017 compared to $8.63 per barrel for 2016, representing an unfavorable decrease of $0.89 per barrel. We estimate that the reduction in discounts for sour crude oils that we processed in 2017 had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $305 million.•Lower discounts on other feedstocks. In addition to crude oil, we utilize other feedstocks such as residuals, in certain of our refining processes. We benefit when we process these other feedstocks that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil. While we benefitted from processing these types of feedstocks in 2017, that benefit declined compared to 2016. We estimate that the reduction in the discounts for the other feedstocks that we processed in 2017 had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $203 million.•Higher costs of biofuel credits. As described in Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending obligation under various government and regulatory compliance programs. The cost of these credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) was $942 million in 2017 compared to $749 million in 2016, an increase of $193 million.•Increase in charges from VLP. Charges from the VLP segment for transportation and terminaling services increased $89 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to additional services provided by terminals and a product pipeline system acquired by VLP in 2017 and 2016 that were formerly a part of the refining segment, as well as an undivided interest in crude system assets acquired by VLP in 2017. Details regarding the increase in charges from VLP are discussed in the VLP segment analysis below.Refining segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased $219 million primarily due to an increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices ($2.98 per MMBtu for 2017 compared to $2.46 per MMBtu for 2016).Refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased $66 million due to an increase in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense primarily due to 49Table of Contentscosts incurred in the latter part of 2016 in connection with significant turnaround projects at our Port Arthur and Texas City Refineries.Ethanol Segment ResultsEthanol segment revenues decreased $401 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower ethanol and corn related co-product prices. This decline in ethanol segment revenue was partially offset by lower cost of sales of $233 million primarily due to lower corn prices, resulting in a decrease in ethanol segment operating income of $168 million in 2017 compared to 2016.Excluding the adjustment reflected in the table on page 41, ethanol segment adjusted operating income was $172 million for 2017 compared to $290 million for 2016, a decrease of $118 million. The components of this decrease, along with the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.Ethanol segment margin, as defined in note (h) to the accompanying tables (see page 46), decreased $75 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the following:•Lower ethanol prices. Ethanol prices were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher industry production, which resulted in higher domestic inventories. For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $1.56 per gallon for 2017 compared to $1.60 per gallon for 2016. We estimate that the decrease in the price of ethanol had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $73 million.•Lower co-product prices. A decrease in export demand for corn related co-products, primarily distiller’s grains, had an unfavorable effect on the prices we received. We estimate that the decrease in the price for corn related co-products had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $52 million.•Lower corn prices. Despite a slight increase in the CBOT corn price from $3.58 per bushel for 2016 to $3.59 per bushel for 2017, we acquired corn at lower prices due to favorable location differentials, resulting in a decrease in the price we paid for corn in 2017 compared to 2016. We estimate that the decrease in the price we paid for corn had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $25 million.•Higher production volumes. Ethanol segment margin was favorably impacted by increased production volumes of 130,000 gallons per day in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reliability improvements. We estimate that the increase in production volumes had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $25 million.Ethanol segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased $28 million primarily due to an increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices ($2.98 per MMBtu for 2017 compared to $2.46 per MMBtu for 2016).Ethanol segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased $15 million primarily due to the write-off of assets that were idled in 2017.VLP Segment ResultsVLP segment revenues increased $89 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to $61 million of incremental revenues generated from transportation and terminaling services associated with the Port Arthur terminal and the Parkway pipeline acquired by VLP in 2017 and the McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers 50Table of Contentsterminals acquired by VLP in 2016 that were formerly a part of the refining segment. In addition, incremental revenues of $10 million were generated from an undivided interest in the Red River crude system acquired in January 2017. The increase in VLP segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $15 million primarily due to the costs to operate the acquired terminals, pipeline and crude system, resulting in an increase in VLP segment operating income of $71 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the adjustment reflected in the table on page 41, VLP adjusted operating income increased $74 million.Corporate and EliminationsCorporate and eliminations, which consists primarily of general and administrative expenses and related depreciation and amortization expense, increased $119 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher employee related costs of $50 million, an increase in legal and environmental reserves of $21 million, expenses associated with the termination of certain assets from Plains of $16 million, and an increase in charitable contributions of $10 million.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOverviewWe believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.Our liquidity consisted of the following as of December 31, 2018 (in millions):Available borrowing capacity from committed facilities: Valero Revolver $2,943Canadian Revolver 107Accounts receivable sales facility 1,200Letter of credit facility 100Total available borrowing capacity 4,350Cash and cash equivalents(a) 2,747Total liquidity $7,097___________________(a)Excludes $235 million of cash and cash equivalents related to our variable interest entities (VIEs) that is available for use only by our VIEs.Information about our outstanding borrowings, letters of credit issued, and availability under our credit facilities is reflected in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.51Table of ContentsCash Flows SummaryComponents of our cash flows are set forth below (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities$4,371 $5,482 $4,820Investing activities(3,928) (2,382) (2,006)Financing activities(3,168) (2,272) (2,012)Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash(143) 206 (100)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(2,868) $1,034 $702Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2018Our operations generated $4.4 billion of cash in 2018, driven primarily by net income of $3.4 billion and noncash charges to income of $2.3 billion, partially offset by a negative change in working capital of $1.3 billion. Noncash charges included $2.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and $203 million of deferred income tax expense. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. The change in our working capital is detailed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of cash resulting from the $1.3 billion change in working capital was mainly due to:•an increase in receivables resulting from an increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in commodity prices;•an increase in inventory primarily due to higher inventory levels;•a decrease in income taxes payable primarily resulting from (i) $527 million of payments in early 2018 related to 2017 tax liabilities and (ii) $181 million of payments in late 2018 that will be applied to 2019 tax liabilities;•a decrease in accrued expenses mainly due to the timing of payments on our environmental compliance program obligations; partially offset by•an increase in accounts payable due to an increase in crude oil and other feedstock volumes purchased, partially offset by a decrease in commodity prices.The $4.4 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with (i) $1.3 billion in proceeds from debt issuances and borrowings and $109 million in proceeds from borrowings of certain VIEs (as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and (ii) $2.9 billion from available cash on hand, were used mainly to:•fund $2.7 billion in capital investments, which include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and investments in joint ventures;•fund (i) $468 million for the Peru Acquisition (as defined and discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) in May 2018; (ii) $320 million for the acquisition of three ethanol plants in November 2018; and (iii) $88 million for other minor acquisitions;•fund $124 million of capital expenditures of certain VIEs;•acquire undivided interests in pipeline and terminal assets for $212 million;•redeem our 9.375 percent Senior Notes due March 15, 2019 for $787 million (or 104.9 percent of stated value);•make payments on debt and capital lease obligations of $435 million, of which $410 million related to the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under VLP’s $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the VLP Revolver);52Table of Contents•retire $137 million of debt assumed in connection with the Peru Acquisition;•purchase common stock for treasury of $1.7 billion;•pay common stock dividends of $1.4 billion; and•pay distributions to noncontrolling interests of $116 million.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2017Our operations generated $5.5 billion of cash in 2017. Net income of $4.2 billion, net of the $1.9 billion noncash benefit from Tax Reform and other noncash charges of $2.1 billion, and a positive change in working capital of $1.3 billion were the primary drivers of the cash generated by our operations in 2017. Other noncash charges included $2.0 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. The Tax Reform benefit and the change in our working capital are detailed in Notes 15 and 18, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The source of cash resulting from the $1.3 billion change in working capital was mainly due to:•an increase in accounts payable primarily as a result of an increase in commodity prices; and•an increase in income taxes payable resulting from deferring the payment of our fourth quarter 2017 estimated taxes to January 2018, as allowed by tax relief authorization from the IRS; partially offset by•an increase in receivables primarily as a result of an increase in commodity prices; and•an increase in inventory due to higher volumes held combined with an increase in commodity prices.The $5.5 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with borrowings of $380 million under the VLP Revolver as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, were used mainly to:•fund $2.3 billion in capital investments, which include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and investments in joint ventures;•acquire an undivided interest in crude system assets for $72 million;•purchase common stock for treasury of $1.4 billion;•pay common stock dividends of $1.2 billion;•pay distributions to noncontrolling interests of $67 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $1.0 billion.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2016Our operations generated $4.8 billion of cash in 2016, driven primarily by net income of $2.4 billion, net noncash charges to income of $1.4 billion, and a positive change in working capital of $976 million. Noncash charges included $1.9 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $56 million for the asset impairment loss associated with our Aruba Terminal, and $230 million of deferred income tax expense, partially offset by a benefit of $747 million from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. The change in our working capital is detailed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The source of cash resulting from the $976 million change in working capital was mainly due to:•an increase in accounts payable primarily as a result of higher commodity prices;•a reduction of our inventories; and•a reduction in prepaid expenses and other related to income taxes receivable due to utilization in 2016 of our 2015 overpayment of taxes; partially offset by•an increase in receivables primarily as a result of higher commodity prices.53Table of ContentsThe $4.8 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with $2.2 billion in proceeds from debt issuances and borrowings (as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), were used mainly to:•fund $2.0 billion in capital investments, which include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and investments in joint ventures;•redeem our 6.125 percent Senior Notes due June 15, 2017 for $778 million (or 103.70 percent of stated value) and our 7.2 percent Senior Notes due October 15, 2017 for $213 million (or 106.27 percent of stated value);•make payments on debt and capital lease obligations of $525 million, of which $494 million related to borrowings under the VLP Revolver, $9 million related to capital lease obligations, and $22 million related to other debt;•pay off a long-term liability of $137 million owed to a joint venture partner for an owner-method joint venture investment;•purchase common stock for treasury of $1.3 billion;•pay common stock dividends of $1.1 billion;•pay distributions to noncontrolling interests of $65 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $702 million.Capital InvestmentsWe define capital investments as capital expenditures for purchases of, additions to, and improvements in our property, plant, and equipment; turnaround and catalyst costs; and investments in joint ventures. Capital expenditures include the capital expenditures of our consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs in which we hold an ownership interest.Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are improved continuously. The cost of improvements, which consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, can be significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly.For both 2019 and 2020, we expect to incur approximately $2.5 billion for capital investments, consisting of approximately 60 percent for sustaining capital and 40 percent for growth strategies. However, we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. This capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions, including acquisitions of undivided interests.54Table of ContentsIn addition to our capital investments noted above, we separately reflect in our statements of cash flows the capital expenditures of certain VIEs that we consolidate even though we do not hold an ownership interest in them. These expenditures are not included in our $2.5 billion estimate of capital investments for 2019 or 2020. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our VIEs.Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesMerger with VLPOn January 10, 2019, we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding publicly held common units of VLP pursuant to the Merger Transaction with VLP. Upon completion of the Merger Transaction, each outstanding publicly held common unit was converted into the right to receive $42.25 per common unit in cash without any interest thereon, and all such publicly traded common units were automatically canceled and ceased to exist. Upon completion of the Merger Transaction, we paid aggregate merger consideration of $950 million, which was funded with available cash on hand. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Merger Transaction.Stock Purchase ProgramsOn January 23, 2018, our board of directors authorized the 2018 Program, which authorized our purchase of up to an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common stock with no expiration date. This authorization was in addition to the remaining amount available under a $2.5 billion program authorized under the 2016 Program. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our purchases under the 2016 Program. As of December 31, 2018, we had $2.2 billion remaining available for purchase under the 2018 Program. We have no obligation to make purchases under this program.Pension Plan FundingWe plan to contribute approximately $35 million to our pension plans and $21 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2019. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our employee benefit plans.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Notes 8 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our environmental matters.Tax MattersThe IRS has ongoing audits related to our U.S. federal income tax returns from 2010 through 2015. We have received Revenue Agent Reports in connection with the 2010 and 2011 combined audit. We have made significant progress in resolving this audit, which we believe will be settled within the next 12 months. Upon settlement, we anticipate receiving a refund; therefore, we have a receivable of $336 million associated with this audit as of December 31, 2018. We do not expect to have a significant change to our uncertain tax positions upon the settlement of our ongoing audits, and we believe that the ultimate settlement of our audits will not be material to our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.55Table of ContentsCash Held by Our International SubsidiariesIn conjunction with our implementation of the provisions under Tax Reform, as described in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded a liability of $740 million for the estimated U.S. federal tax due on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings and profits of our international subsidiaries not previously distributed to us, and we will pay this liability over the eight-year period permitted by the provisions under Tax Reform. Because of the deemed repatriation of these accumulated earnings and profits, there are no longer any U.S. federal income tax consequences associated with the repatriation of any of the $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018. However, certain countries in which our international subsidiaries are organized impose withholding taxes on cash distributed outside of those countries. We have accrued for withholding taxes on the portion of the cash held by one of our international subsidiaries that we have deemed not to be permanently reinvested in our operations in that country. The remaining cash held by that subsidiary, as well as our other international subsidiaries, will be permanently reinvested in our operations in those countries.Concentration of CustomersOur operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Year 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter TotalDebt and capitallease obligations (a)$283 $920 $77 $69 $85 $8,431 $9,865Operating lease obligations359 245 178 146 123 514 1,565Purchase obligations14,853 2,309 1,630 1,407 1,320 4,333 25,852Other long-term liabilities— 249 232 235 261 1,890 2,867Total$15,495 $3,723 $2,117 $1,857 $1,789 $15,168 $40,149______________________________(a)Debt obligations exclude amounts related to unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. Capital lease obligations include related interest expense.Debt and Capital Lease ObligationsOur debt and capital lease obligations are described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.56Table of ContentsOur debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. All of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt as of December 31, 2018 are at or above investment grade level as follows: RatingRating Agency Valero VLPMoody’s Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook) Baa3 (no outlook)Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook) BBB- (no outlook)Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook) BBB- (no outlook)In January 2019, after the completion of the Merger Transaction as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each of the rating agencies upgraded its rating of VLP’s senior unsecured debt to our rating. The rating change follows the full and unconditional guarantee by us of VLP’s senior notes.We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.Operating Lease ObligationsOur long-term operating lease commitments include leases for land and office facilities; time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels; railcars; facilities and equipment related to industrial gases and power used in our operations; machinery and equipment used in our refining and ethanol operations; and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstock, refined petroleum product and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations under certain crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, industrial gas supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), natural gas supply arrangements, and various throughput, transportation and terminaling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of feedstock and utilities and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries and ethanol plants. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the preceding table include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (ii) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions.57Table of ContentsOther Long-Term LiabilitiesOur other long-term liabilities are described in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the preceding table, we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2018.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAs discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements became effective January 1, 2019, or will become effective in the future. The effect on our financial statements upon adoption of these pronouncements is discussed in the above-referenced note.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies.The amount of our accruals for environmental matters as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Unrecognized Tax BenefitsWe take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority. When we take such positions, we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions, if any, that should be recognized in our financial statements. Tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability in our balance sheets and 58Table of Contentsthat liability represents our potential future obligation to the taxing authorities if the tax position is not sustained.The evaluation of tax positions and the determination of the benefit arising from such positions that are recognized in our financial statements requires us to make significant judgments and estimates based on an analysis of complex tax laws and regulations and related interpretations. These judgments and estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and changes in legislation.Our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits, are included in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit ObligationsWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are disclosed and described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we utilized a forward-looking model of asset returns. The historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to December 31, 2018 was 9.38 percent. The actual return on assets for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was (5.53) percent, 19.31 percent, and 7.77 percent, respectively. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements. The following sensitivity analysis shows the effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2019 (in millions): Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefitsIncrease in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease of 0.25%$104 $8Compensation rate increase of 0.25%12 n/aIncrease in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease of 0.25%9 1Expected return on plan assets decrease of 0.25%6 n/aCompensation rate increase of 0.25%3 n/aOur net periodic benefit cost is determined using the spot-rate approach. Under this approach, our net periodic benefit cost is impacted by the spot rates of the corporate bond yield curve used to calculate our liability discount rate. If the yield curve were to flatten entirely and our liability discount rate remained unchanged, our net periodic benefit cost would increase by $10 million for pension benefits and $1 million for other postretirement benefits in 2019.See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.59Table of ContentsInventory ValuationThe cost of our inventories is principally determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using the dollar-value LIFO approach. Our LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value and our non-LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The market value of our LIFO inventories is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories.We compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis, excluding materials and supplies. In determining the market value of our inventories, we assume our refinery and ethanol feedstocks are converted into refined petroleum products, which requires us to make estimates regarding the refined petroleum products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined petroleum products. We also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our refineries and ethanol plants to the appropriate points of sale. We then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories. If the aggregate market value is less than cost, we recognize a loss for the difference in our statements of income.The lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2016 is discussed in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined petroleum products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), soybean oil, and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including futures and options to manage the volatility of:•inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a LIFO basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels; and•forecasted feedstock and refined petroleum product purchases, refined petroleum product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable.Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.The following sensitivity analysis includes all of our derivative instruments entered into for purposes other than trading with which we have market risk (in millions): December 31, 2018 2017Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices$2 $(43)10% decrease in underlying commodity prices(6) 4560Table of ContentsSee Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2018.COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory environmental compliance programs. To manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would have resulted from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts was not material. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs.INTEREST RATE RISKThe following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.

The fair value of the swap was immaterial for all periods presented.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKAs of December 31, 2018, we had commitments to purchase $441 million of U.S. dollars.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Item 1A, “RISK FACTORS,” and Item 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA,” included in this report.CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995This report, including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK,” includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “scheduled,” “estimate,” “project,” “projection,” “predict,” “budget,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “target,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “will,” “may,” and similar expressions.These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding:•future refining segment margins, including gasoline and distillate margins;•future ethanol segment margins;•future renewable diesel segment margins;•expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil differentials, and operating expenses;•anticipated levels of crude oil and refined petroleum product inventories;•our anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and joint venture investments, and the effect of those capital investments on our results of operations;•anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products in the regions where we operate, as well as globally;•expectations regarding environmental, tax, and other regulatory initiatives; and•the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining, ethanol, and renewable diesel industry fundamentals.We based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following:•acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined petroleum products or receive feedstocks;•political and economic conditions in nations that produce crude oil or consume refined petroleum products;•demand for, and supplies of, refined petroleum products (such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and petrochemicals), ethanol, and renewable diesel;•demand for, and supplies of, crude oil and other feedstocks;23Table of Contents•the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls;•the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations;•refinery overcapacity or undercapacity;•our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations;•the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and adjustments to refining capacity in response to market conditions;•the level of competitors’ imports into markets that we supply;•accidents, unscheduled shutdowns, or other catastrophes affecting our refineries, machinery, pipelines, equipment, and information systems, or those of our suppliers or customers;•changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined petroleum products;•the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles;•the levels of government subsidies for alternative fuels;•the volatility in the market price of biofuel credits (primarily RINs needed to comply with the RFS) and GHG emission credits needed to comply with the requirements of various GHG emission programs;•delay of, cancellation of, or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects;•earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil, grain and other feedstocks, refined petroleum products, ethanol, and renewable diesel;•rulings, judgments, or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs, in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage;•legislative or regulatory action, including the introduction or enactment of legislation or rulemakings by governmental authorities, including tariffs and tax and environmental regulations, such as those implemented under the California cap-and-trade system and similar programs, and the U.S. EPA’s regulation of GHGs, which may adversely affect our business or operations;•changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and trade credit;•changes in currency exchange rates, including the value of the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling, the euro, the Mexican peso, and the Peruvian sol relative to the U.S. dollar;•overall economic conditions, including the stability and liquidity of financial markets; and•other factors generally described in the “RISK FACTORS” section included in Item 1A, “RISK FACTORS” in this report.Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so.All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.24Table of ContentsNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe discussions in “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK” and “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” below include references to financial measures that are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments) and refining, ethanol, and renewable diesel segment margin. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between years. See the tables in note (f) beginning on page 39 for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Also in note (f), we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information.OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOKOverviewFor 2019, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $2.4 billion compared to $3.1 billion for 2018, which represents a decrease of $700 million. This decrease is the result of a $569 million decrease in net income and a $131 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to a $279 million pre-tax increase in blender’s tax credits recognized in 2019 compared to 2018, of which 50 percent is attributable to the holder of the noncontrolling interest, as described in note (a) on page 38. The decrease in net income is primarily due to a decrease of $736 million in operating income between the periods, net of the resulting $177 million decrease in income tax expense.While operating income decreased by $736 million in 2019 compared to 2018, adjusted operating income decreased by $1.0 billion. Adjusted operating income excludes adjustments reflected in the table in note (f) on page 42.The $1.0 billion decrease in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the following:•Refining segment. Refining segment adjusted operating income decreased by $1.1 billion primarily due to weaker discounts on crude oils and other feedstocks and lower throughput volumes, partially offset by improved distillate margins. This is more fully described on pages 31 and 32.•Ethanol segment. Ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased by $78 million primarily due to higher corn prices and higher operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), partially offset by higher ethanol prices. This is more fully described on page 33.•Renewable diesel segment. Renewable diesel segment adjusted operating income increased by $259 million primarily due to an increase in renewable diesel sales volumes and an increase in the benefit from the blender’s tax credit resulting from an increase in the volume of renewable diesel blended with petroleum-based diesel in 2019 compared to 2018. This is more fully described on pages 34 and 35.25Table of ContentsOutlookBelow are several factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2020:•Distillate margins are expected to begin improving due to an anticipated increase in global demand as trade war tensions ease and markets comply with the International Maritime Organization’s lower bunker fuel sulfur specifications, which were effective January 1, 2020. Gasoline margins are expected to remain near current levels.•Discounts for medium and heavy sour crude oils are expected to remain near current levels as compliance with the new bunker fuel sulfur specifications noted above is expected to reduce demand for high sulfur fuel oils, which compete with sour crude oils as a refining feedstock.•Ethanol margins are expected to decline as domestic inventory levels rise.•Renewable diesel segment margins are expected to remain near current levels.•Our refining operations in the U.K. could be adversely affected by Brexit, which formally occurred on January 31, 2020. Although the legal relationship between the U.K. and the EU has changed, their ongoing relationship will continue to follow the EU’s rules during a transition period that is set to expire on December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the U.K. and the EU are expected to negotiate a new free trade agreement, which could negatively impact the operations of our Pembroke Refinery and our marketing operations in the U.K. and Ireland, as could the failure to reach any agreement. The ultimate effect of Brexit will depend on whether an agreement is reached, or on the specific terms of any agreement that is reached by the U.K. and the EU. See Item 1A “RISK FACTORS”—Changes in the U.K.’s economic and other relationships with the EU could adversely affect us.•Global concern about the coronavirus outbreak could result in lower demand for and consumption of transportation fuels, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following tables, including the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures in note (f) beginning on page 39, highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market reference prices that directly impact our operations.Effective January 1, 2019, we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, we created a new reportable segment — renewable diesel — because of the growing importance of renewable fuels in the market and the growth of our investments in renewable fuels production. The renewable diesel segment includes the operations of DGD, which were transferred from the refining segment on January 1, 2019. Also effective January 1, 2019, we no longer have a VLP segment, and we include the operations of VLP in our refining segment. This change was made because of the Merger Transaction with VLP, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the resulting change in how we manage VLP’s operations. We no longer manage VLP as a business but as logistics assets that support the operations of our refining segment. Our prior period segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation.26Table of Contents2019 Compared to 2018Financial Highlights by Segment and Total Company(millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31, 2019 Refining Ethanol RenewableDiesel CorporateandEliminations TotalRevenues: Revenues from external customers$103,746 $3,606 $970 $2 $108,324Intersegment revenues18 231 247 (496) —Total revenues103,764 3,837 1,217 (494) 108,324Cost of sales: Cost of materials and other (a)93,371 3,239 360 (494) 96,476Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense reflected below)4,289 504 75 — 4,868Depreciation and amortization expense2,062 90 50 — 2,202Total cost of sales99,722 3,833 485 (494) 103,546Other operating expenses (b)20 1 — — 21General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense reflected below)— — — 868 868Depreciation and amortization expense— — — 53 53Operating income by segment$4,022 $3 $732 $(921) 3,836Other income, net (d) 104Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest (454)Income before income tax expense 3,486Income tax expense 702Net income 2,784Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (a) 362Net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders $2,422________________See note references on pages 38 through 42.27Table of ContentsFinancial Highlights by Segment and Total Company (continued)(millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31, 2018 Refining Ethanol RenewableDiesel CorporateandEliminations TotalRevenues: Revenues from external customers$113,093 $3,428 $508 $4 $117,033Intersegment revenues25 210 170 (405) —Total revenues113,118 3,638 678 (401) 117,033Cost of sales: Cost of materials and other (a)101,866 3,008 262 (404) 104,732Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense reflected below)4,154 470 66 — 4,690Depreciation and amortization expense1,910 78 29 — 2,017Total cost of sales107,930 3,556 357 (404) 111,439Other operating expenses (b)45 — — — 45General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense reflected below) (c)— — — 925 925Depreciation and amortization expense— — — 52 52Operating income by segment$5,143 $82 $321 $(974) 4,572Other income, net (d) 130Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest (470)Income before income tax expense 4,232Income tax expense (e) 879Net income 3,353Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (a) 231Net income attributable toValero Energy Corporation stockholders $3,122________________See note references on pages 38 through 42.28Table of ContentsAverage Market Reference Prices and Differentials Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 ChangeRefining Feedstocks (dollars per barrel) Brent crude oil$64.18 $71.62 $(7.44)Brent less West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil7.15 6.71 0.44Brent less Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil(0.86) 0.31 (1.17)Brent less LLS crude oil1.47 1.72 (0.25)Brent less Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI) crude oil3.56 5.20 (1.64)Brent less Maya crude oil6.57 9.22 (2.65)LLS crude oil62.71 69.90 (7.19)LLS less ASCI crude oil2.09 3.48 (1.39)LLS less Maya crude oil5.10 7.50 (2.40)WTI crude oil57.03 64.91 (7.88) Natural gas (dollars per million British Thermal Units (MMBtu))2.47 3.23 (0.76) Products (dollars per barrel) U.S. Gulf Coast: Conventional Blendstock of Oxygenate Blending(CBOB) gasoline less Brent4.37 4.81 (0.44)Ultra-low-sulfur (ULS) diesel less Brent14.90 14.02 0.88Propylene less Brent(22.31) (2.86) (19.45)CBOB gasoline less LLS5.84 6.53 (0.69)ULS diesel less LLS16.37 15.74 0.63Propylene less LLS(20.84) (1.14) (19.70)U.S. Mid-Continent: CBOB gasoline less WTI13.62 13.70 (0.08)ULS diesel less WTI22.77 22.82 (0.05)North Atlantic: CBOB gasoline less Brent7.20 7.59 (0.39)ULS diesel less Brent17.22 16.29 0.93U.S. West Coast: CARBOB 87 gasoline less ANS16.28 13.05 3.23CARB diesel less ANS19.30 18.13 1.17CARBOB 87 gasoline less WTI24.29 19.45 4.84CARB diesel less WTI27.31 24.53 2.7829Table of ContentsAverage Market Reference Prices and Differentials, (continued) Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 ChangeEthanol Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) corn (dollars per bushel)$3.84 $3.68 $0.16New York Harbor (NYH) ethanol (dollars per gallon)1.53 1.48 0.05 Renewable diesel New York Mercantile Exchange ULS diesel (dollars per gallon)1.942.09(0.15)Biodiesel RIN (dollars per RIN)0.480.53(0.05)California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (dollars per metric ton)196.82168.2428.58CBOT soybean oil (dollars per pound)0.290.30(0.01)Total Company, Corporate, and OtherThe following table includes selected financial data for the total company, corporate, and other for 2019 and 2018.

This decline in revenues was partially offset by lower cost of sales of $7.9 billion primarily due to decreases in crude oil and other feedstock costs and a decrease of $57 million in general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), resulting in a decrease in operating income of $736 million in 2019 compared to 2018.General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) decreased by $57 million in 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily due to environmental reserve adjustments of $108 million associated with certain non-operating sites in 2018, partially offset by increases in legal and other environmental reserves of $24 million and $12 million, respectively, as well as higher taxes other than income taxes of $8 million and expenses associated with the Merger Transaction with VLP of $7 million.30Table of ContentsAdjusted operating income was $3.7 billion in 2019 compared to $4.7 billion in 2018. Details regarding the $1.0 billion decrease in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below.“Other income, net” decreased by $26 million in 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest income of $30 million and higher foreign currency transaction losses of $14 million, partially offset by the favorable effect of a $16 million lower charge for the early redemption of debt between the periods. As described in note (d) on page 39, we redeemed debt in both 2019 and 2018 and incurred early redemption charges of $22 million and $38 million, respectively.Income tax expense decreased by $177 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate was 20 percent for 2019 compared to 21 percent for 2018.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $131 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a $279 million increase in blender’s tax credits recognized in 2019 compared to 2018, of which 50 percent is attributable to the holder of the noncontrolling interest, as described in note (a) on page 38.Refining Segment ResultsThe following table includes selected financial and operating data of our refining segment for 2019 and 2018.

This decline in refining segment revenues was partially offset by lower cost of sales of $8.2 billion primarily due to decreases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, resulting in a decrease in refining segment operating income of $1.1 billion in 2019 compared to 2018.31Table of ContentsRefining segment adjusted operating income also decreased by $1.1 billion in 2019 compared to 2018. The components of this decrease, along with the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.•Refining segment margin is primarily affected by refined petroleum product prices and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks. The market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of benchmark crude oils, such as Brent, WTI, and ANS. An increase in the differential between the market price of the refined petroleum products that we sell and the cost of the reference benchmark crude oil has a favorable impact on our refining segment margin, while a decline in this differential has a negative impact on our refining segment margin. Additionally, our refining segment margin is affected by our ability to purchase and process crude oils and other feedstocks that are priced at a discount to Brent and other benchmark crude oils. While we benefit when we process these types of crude oils and other feedstocks, that benefit will vary as the discount widens or narrows. Improvement in these discounts has a favorable impact on our refining segment margin as it lowers our cost of materials; whereas lower discounts result in higher cost of materials, which has a negative impact on our refining segment margin. The table on page 29 reflects market reference prices and differentials that we believe had a material impact on the change in our refining segment margin in 2019 compared to 2018. Refining segment margin decreased by $853 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the following:◦Lower discounts on crude oils had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $628 million.◦Lower discounts on feedstocks other than crude oils, such as natural gas and residuals, had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $360 million.◦A decrease in throughput volumes of 34,000 BPD had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $128 million.◦A decrease in the cost of biofuel credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) had a favorable impact on our refining segment margin of $218 million. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our government and regulatory compliance programs.◦An increase in distillate margins throughout most of our regions had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $202 million.•Refining segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $135 million primarily due to higher maintenance costs of $86 million, along with the effect of favorable property tax settlements of $20 million and sales and use tax refunds of $17 million received in 2018 that did not recur in 2019.•Refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased by $152 million primarily due to higher refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense of $82 million and an increase in depreciation expense of $79 million associated with capital projects that were completed and finance leases that commenced in the latter part of 2018 and early 2019, partially offset by the write-off of assets that were idled or demolished in 2018 of $15 million.32Table of ContentsEthanol Segment ResultsThe following table includes selected financial and operating data of our ethanol segment for 2019 and 2018.

We finalized our estimates during the year ended December 31, 2018 and recorded an income tax benefit of $12 million during the period. (f)We use certain financial measures (as noted below) that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.We have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes their utility.39Table of ContentsNon-GAAP financial measures are as follows:◦Refining margin is defined as refining operating income adjusted to reflect the blender’s tax credit in the proper period, and excluding operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses, as reflected in the table below.

This improvement in revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $22.0 billion primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, and an increase of $96 million in general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), resulting in an increase in operating income of $1.0 billion in 2018 compared to 2017.General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $96 million in 2018 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to environmental reserve adjustments of $108 million associated with certain non-operating sites in 2018, partially offset by expenses incurred in 2017 associated with the termination of the acquisition of certain assets from Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. of $16 million.Adjusted operating income was $4.7 billion in 2018 compared to $3.8 billion in 2017. Details regarding the $919 million increase in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below.“Other income, net” increased by $18 million in 2018 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher equity in earnings associated with our Diamond pipeline joint venture of $39 million and higher interest income of $29 million, partially offset by a $38 million charge for the early redemption of debt as described in note (d) on page 39.Income tax expense increased by $1.8 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the effect from a $1.9 billion income tax benefit in 2017 resulting from Tax Reform, as described in note (e) on page 39. Excluding the effect of Tax Reform from 2017, the effective tax rate for 2017 was 28 percent compared to 21 percent for 2018. The decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018 as a result of Tax Reform.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $140 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher earnings associated with DGD, which includes a benefit for the blender’s tax credit 43Table of Contentsof which $80 million is attributable to the holder of the noncontrolling interest, as described in note (a) on page 38.Refining Segment ResultsThe following table includes selected financial and operating data of our refining segment for 2018 and 2017. The selected financial data is derived from the Financial Highlights by Segment and Total Company tables on pages 35 and 36, respectively, unless otherwise noted.

This improvement in refining segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $21.9 billion primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, resulting in an increase in refining segment operating income of $936 million in 2018 compared to 2017.Refining segment adjusted operating income increased by $902 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The components of this increase, along with the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.•Refining segment margin is primarily affected by refined petroleum product prices and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks. The market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of benchmark crude oils, such as Brent, WTI, and ANS. An increase in the differential between the market price of the refined petroleum products that we sell and the cost of the reference benchmark crude oil has a favorable impact on our refining segment margin, while a decline in this differential has a negative impact on our refining segment margin. Additionally, our refining segment margin is affected by our ability to purchase and process crude oils and other feedstocks that are priced at a discount to Brent and other benchmark crude oils. While we benefit when we process these types of crude oils and other feedstocks, that benefit will vary as the discount widens or narrows. Improvement in these discounts has a favorable impact on our refining segment margin as it lowers our cost of materials; whereas lower discounts result in higher cost of materials, which has a negative impact on our refining segment margin. The table on page 37 reflects market reference prices and differentials that we believe had a material impact on the change in our refining segment margin in 2018 compared to 2017. Refining segment margin increased by $1.1 billion in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the following:◦An increase in distillate margins throughout all of our regions had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $1.3 billion.44Table of Contents◦Higher discounts on crude oils had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $561 million.◦A decrease in the cost of biofuel credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of $406 million. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our government and regulatory compliance programs.◦An increase in throughput volumes of 46,000 BPD had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $153 million.◦A decrease in gasoline margins throughout all of our regions had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $1.3 billion.•Refining segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $140 million primarily due to higher employee-related expenses of $33 million, an increase in energy costs of $28 million, the effect of a favorable insurance settlement of $20 million in 2017 for our McKee Refinery, higher maintenance expense of $17 million, and higher chemicals and catalyst costs of $15 million.•Refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased by $86 million primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense of $44 million associated with capital projects that were completed in the latter part of 2017 and early 2018 and higher refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense of $35 million, along with the write-off of assets that were idled or demolished in 2018 of $15 million.Ethanol Segment ResultsThe following table includes selected financial and operating data of our ethanol segment for 2018 and 2017.

The components of this decrease, along with the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.•Ethanol segment margin is primarily affected by ethanol and corn related co-product prices and the cost of corn. The table on page 38 reflects market reference prices that we believe had a material impact on the change in our ethanol segment margin in 2018 compared to 2017. Ethanol segment margin decreased by $66 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the following:◦Lower ethanol prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $159 million.◦Higher corn prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $36 million.◦Higher prices of the corn related co-products that we produced had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $101 million.◦Higher production volumes of 137,000 gallons per day had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $26 million.•Ethanol segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $27 million primarily due to costs to operate the three plants acquired from Green Plains in November 2018 of $14 million and higher chemicals and catalysts costs of $8 million incurred by our other ethanol plants.Renewable Diesel Segment ResultsThe following table includes selected financial and operating data of our renewable diesel segment for 2018 and 2017. The selected financial data is derived from the Financial Highlights by Segment and Total Company tables on pages 35 and 36, respectively, unless otherwise noted.

This improvement in renewable diesel segment revenues, along with 46Table of Contentsa decrease in total cost of sales of $217 million, resulted in an increase in renewable diesel segment operating income of $261 million.Renewable diesel segment adjusted operating income increased by $97 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The components of this increase, along with the reasons for the changes in these components are outlined below.•Renewable diesel segment margin increased by $116 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the following:◦An increase in renewable diesel prices in 2018 had a favorable impact to our renewable diesel segment margin of $60 million.◦Price risk management activities had a favorable impact to our renewable diesel segment margin of $40 million. We recognized a hedge gain of $29 million in 2018 from commodity derivative instruments associated with our price risk management activities compared to a loss of $11 million in 2017.•Renewable diesel segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $19 million primarily attributable to higher chemical and catalyst costs of $10 million and increased costs resulting from the expansion of the DGD Plant completed in the third quarter of 2018 of $3 million.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOverviewWe believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.Our liquidity consisted of the following as of December 31, 2019 (in millions):Available borrowing capacity from committed facilities: Valero Revolver $3,966Canadian Revolver 112Accounts receivable sales facility 1,200Letter of credit facility 50Total available borrowing capacity 5,328Cash and cash equivalents(a) 2,473Total liquidity $7,801___________________(a)Excludes $110 million of cash and cash equivalents related to our variable interest entities (VIEs) that is available for use only by our VIEs.47Table of ContentsInformation about our outstanding borrowings, letters of credit issued, and availability under our credit facilities is reflected in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash FlowsComponents of our cash flows are set forth below (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities$5,531 $4,371 $5,482Investing activities(3,001) (3,928) (2,382)Financing activities(2,997) (3,168) (2,272)Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash68 (143) 206Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(399) $(2,868) $1,034Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2019Our operations generated $5.5 billion of cash in 2019, driven primarily by net income of $2.8 billion, noncash charges to income of $2.5 billion, and a positive change in working capital of $294 million. Noncash charges included $2.3 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and $234 million of deferred income tax expense. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. The change in our working capital is detailed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The source of cash resulting from the $294 million change in working capital was mainly due to:•an increase of $1.5 billion in accounts payable due to an increase in commodity prices in December 2019 compared to December 2018 combined with an increase in crude oil volumes purchased and the timing of payments of invoices;•a decrease of $427 million in prepaid expenses and other mainly due to a decrease in income taxes receivable resulting from a refund of $348 million, including interest, associated with the settlement of the combined audit related to our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2010 and 2011;•an increase of $153 million in income taxes payable primarily resulting from higher pre-tax income in the fourth quarter of 2019; partially offset by•an increase of $1.5 billion in receivables resulting from (i) an increase in commodity prices in December 2019 compared to December 2018 combined with an increase in sales volumes, and (ii) a receivable of $449 million for the blender’s tax credit attributable to volumes blended during 2019 and 2018; and•an increase of $385 million in inventories due to an increase in commodity prices in December 2019 compared to December 2018 combined with higher inventory levels.The $5.5 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with (i) $992 million of proceeds from debt issuances related to our 4.00 percent Senior Notes, (ii) $239 million of proceeds from borrowings of VIEs, and (iii) $399 million from available cash on hand, were used mainly to:•fund $2.7 billion in capital investments, as defined in “Capital Investments” on page 50, of which $160 million related to self-funded capital investments by DGD;•fund $225 million of capital expenditures of VIEs other than DGD;•acquire undivided interests in pipeline and terminal assets for $72 million;•redeem our 6.125 percent Senior Notes for $871 million (or 102.48 percent of stated value);•purchase common stock for treasury of $777 million;48Table of Contents•pay common stock dividends of $1.5 billion;•acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common units of VLP for $950 million; and•pay distributions to noncontrolling interests of $70 million.In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold and repaid $900 million of eligible receivables under our accounts receivable sales facility.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2018Our operations generated $4.4 billion of cash in 2018, driven primarily by net income of $3.4 billion and noncash charges to income of $2.3 billion, partially offset by a negative change in working capital of $1.3 billion. Noncash charges included $2.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and $203 million of deferred income tax expense. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. The change in our working capital is detailed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of cash resulting from the $1.3 billion change in working capital was mainly due to:•an increase of $457 million in receivables resulting from an increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in commodity prices;•an increase of $197 million in inventory primarily due to higher inventory levels;•a decrease of $684 million in income taxes payable primarily resulting from (i) $527 million of payments in early 2018 related to 2017 tax liabilities and (ii) $181 million of payments in late 2018 that will be applied to 2019 tax liabilities; •a decrease of $113 million in accrued expenses mainly due to the timing of payments on our environmental compliance program obligations; partially offset by•an increase of $304 million in accounts payable due to an increase in crude oil and other feedstock volumes purchased, partially offset by a decrease in commodity prices.The $4.4 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with (i) $1.3 billion of proceeds from debt issuances and borrowings, (ii) $109 million of proceeds from borrowings of VIEs, and (iii) $2.9 billion from available cash on hand, were used mainly to:•fund $2.7 billion in capital investments, of which $192 million related to self-funded capital investments by DGD;•fund $124 million of capital expenditures of VIEs other than DGD;•fund (i) $468 million for the Peru Acquisition (as defined and discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) in May 2018; (ii) $320 million for the acquisition of three ethanol plants in November 2018; and (iii) $88 million for other minor acquisitions;•acquire undivided interests in pipeline and terminal assets for $212 million;•redeem our 9.375 percent Senior Notes for $787 million (or 104.9 percent of stated value);•make payments on debt and finance lease obligations of $435 million, of which $410 million related to the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under VLP’s $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the VLP Revolver);•retire $137 million of debt assumed in connection with the Peru Acquisition;•purchase common stock for treasury of $1.7 billion;•pay common stock dividends of $1.4 billion; and•pay distributions to noncontrolling interests of $116 million.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2017Our operations generated $5.5 billion of cash in 2017. Net income of $4.2 billion, net of the $1.9 billion noncash benefit from Tax Reform and other noncash charges of $2.1 billion, and a positive change in working 49Table of Contentscapital of $1.3 billion were the primary drivers of the cash generated by our operations in 2017. Other noncash charges included $2.0 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. The Tax Reform benefit and the change in our working capital are detailed in Notes 15 and 18, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The source of cash resulting from the $1.3 billion change in working capital was mainly due to:•an increase of $1.8 billion in accounts payable primarily as a result of an increase in commodity prices;•an increase of $489 million in income taxes payable resulting from deferring the payment of our fourth quarter 2017 estimated taxes to January 2018, as allowed by tax relief authorization from the IRS; partially offset by•an increase of $870 million in receivables primarily as a result of an increase in commodity prices; and•an increase of $516 million in inventory due to higher volumes held combined with an increase in commodity prices.The $5.5 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with borrowings of $380 million under the VLP Revolver, were used mainly to:•fund $2.3 billion in capital investments, of which $88 million related to self-funded capital investments by DGD;•fund $26 million of capital expenditures of VIEs other than DGD;•acquire an undivided interest in crude system assets for $72 million;•purchase common stock for treasury of $1.4 billion;•pay common stock dividends of $1.2 billion;•pay distributions to noncontrolling interests of $67 million; and•increase available cash on hand by $1.0 billion.Capital InvestmentsOur operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are improved continuously. The cost of improvements, which consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, can be significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly.50Table of ContentsWe consider capital investments to include the following:•Capital expenditures for purchases of, additions to, and improvements in our property, plant, and equipment, including those made by DGD but excluding other VIEs; •Deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, including those made by DGD; and•Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.We include DGD’s capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures in capital investments because we, as operator of DGD, manage its capital projects and expenditures. We do not include the capital expenditures of our other consolidated VIEs in capital investments because we do not operate those VIEs. In addition, we do not include expenditures for acquisitions and acquisitions of undivided interests in capital investments.We expect to make capital investments of approximately $2.5 billion in 2020. Approximately 60 percent of those investments are for sustaining the business and 40 percent are for growth strategies. However, we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. This capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions, including acquisitions of undivided interests.Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Purchase ProgramOn January 23, 2018, our board of directors authorized the 2018 Program for the purchase of our outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.5 billion remaining available for purchase under the 2018 Program with no expiration date. We have no obligation to make purchases under this program.Pension Plan FundingWe plan to contribute approximately $140 million to our pension plans and $21 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2020. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our employee benefit plans.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of our environmental liabilities.Tax MattersWe take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority. When we take such positions, we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions, if any, that should be recognized in our financial statements. Tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained.As of December 31, 2019, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, was $868 million. Of this amount, $525 million is associated with refund claims associated with taxes paid 51Table of Contentson incentive payments received from the U.S. federal government for blending biofuels into refined petroleum products. We recorded a tax refund receivable of $525 million in connection with our refund claims, but we also recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $525 million due to the complexity of this matter and uncertainties with respect to sustaining these refund claims. Therefore, our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity will not be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in sustaining these refund claims. The remaining liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, of $343 million represents our potential future obligations to various taxing authorities if the tax positions associated with that liability are not sustained.Details about our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits, are included in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash Held by Our International SubsidiariesAs of December 31, 2019, $1.5 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our international subsidiaries. Cash held by our international subsidiaries can be repatriated to us without any U.S. federal income tax consequences as a result of the deemed repatriation provisions of Tax Reform, but certain other taxes may apply, including, but not limited to, withholding taxes imposed by certain international jurisdictions and U.S. state income taxes. Therefore, there is a cost to repatriate cash held by certain of our international subsidiaries to us, but we believe that such amount is not material to our financial position or liquidity.Concentration of CustomersOur operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.52Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 are summarized below (in millions).

Finance lease obligations include related interest expense. Debt obligations due in 2020 include $348 million associated with borrowings under the IEnova Revolver (as defined and described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) for the construction of terminals in Mexico by Central Mexico Terminals (as defined and described in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The IEnova Revolver is only available to the operations of Central Mexico Terminals, and its creditors do not have recourse against us.(b)Operating lease liabilities include related interest expense.(c)Other long-term liabilities exclude amounts related to the long-term portion of operating lease liabilities that are separately presented above.Debt and Finance Lease ObligationsOur debt and finance lease obligations are described in Notes 9 and 5, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements may increase. As of December 31, 2019, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt, including debt guaranteed by us, are at or above investment grade level as follows:Rating Agency RatingMoody’s Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook)Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook)Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook)We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.Debt Obligations – Interest PaymentsInterest payments for our debt obligations as described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are the expected payments based on information available as of December 31, 2019.53Table of ContentsOperating Lease LiabilitiesOur operating lease liabilities arise from leasing arrangements for the right to use various classes of underlying assets as described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating lease liabilities are recognized for leasing arrangements with terms greater than one year and are not reduced by minimum lease payments to be received by us under subleases.Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations under certain crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, industrial gas supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), natural gas supply arrangements, and various throughput, transportation and terminaling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of feedstock and utilities and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries and ethanol plants. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the preceding table include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (ii) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions.Other Long-Term LiabilitiesOur other long-term liabilities are described in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the preceding table, we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2019.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAs discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements became effective January 1, 2020, or will become effective in the future. The effect on our financial statements upon adoption of these pronouncements is discussed in the above-referenced note.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes.Unrecognized Tax BenefitsWe take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority. When we take such positions, we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions, if any, that should be recognized in our financial statements. Tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax 54Table of Contentsbenefits, which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained.The evaluation of tax positions and the determination of the benefit arising from such positions that are recognized in our financial statements requires us to make significant judgments and estimates based on an analysis of complex tax laws and regulations and related interpretations. These judgments and estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and changes in legislation.Details of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits, are included in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies.The amount of our accruals for environmental matters are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit ObligationsWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are disclosed and described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we utilized a forward-looking model of asset returns. The historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to December 31, 2019 was 9.41 percent. The actual return on assets for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was 23.44 percent, (5.53) percent, and 19.31 percent, respectively. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements.55Table of ContentsThe following sensitivity analysis shows the effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2020 (in millions): Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefitsIncrease in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease of 0.25%$134 $10Compensation rate increase of 0.25%17 n/aIncrease in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease of 0.25%12 —Expected return on plan assets decrease of 0.25%6 n/aCompensation rate increase of 0.25%4 n/aOur net periodic benefit cost is determined using the spot-rate approach. Under this approach, our net periodic benefit cost is impacted by the spot rates of the corporate bond yield curve used to calculate our liability discount rate. If the yield curve were to flatten entirely and our liability discount rate remained unchanged, our net periodic benefit cost would increase by $16 million for pension benefits and $2 million for other postretirement benefits in 2020.See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.Inventory ValuationThe cost of our inventories is principally determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using the dollar-value LIFO approach. Our LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value and our non-LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The market value of our LIFO inventories is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories.We compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis, excluding materials and supplies. In determining the market value of our inventories, we assume that feedstocks are converted into refined products, which requires us to make estimates regarding the refined products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined products. We also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our plants to the appropriate points of sale. We then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories. If the aggregate market value is less than cost, we recognize a loss for the difference in our statements of income.56Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined petroleum products (primarily gasoline and distillate), renewable diesel, grain (primarily corn), renewable diesel feedstocks, and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including futures and options to manage the volatility of:•inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a LIFO basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels; and•forecasted feedstock and refined petroleum product purchases, refined petroleum product sales, renewable diesel sales, or natural gas purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable.Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.The following sensitivity analysis includes all of our derivative instruments entered into for purposes other than trading with which we have market risk (in millions): December 31, 2019 2018Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices$(39) $210% decrease in underlying commodity prices38 (6)See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2019.COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory environmental compliance programs. To manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would have resulted from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts was not material.

These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted operating income (loss) (including adjusted operating income (loss) for each of our reportable segments, as applicable); refining, renewable diesel, and ethanol segment margin; and capital investments attributable to Valero. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between years and to help assess our cash flows. See the tables in note (f) beginning on page 46 for reconciliations of adjusted operating income (loss) (including adjusted operating income (loss) for each of our reportable segments, as applicable) and refining, renewable diesel, and ethanol segment margin to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Also in note (f), we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of such non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information. See the table on page 53 for a reconciliation of capital investments attributable to Valero to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Beginning on page 52, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information.32Table of ContentsOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOKOverviewBusiness Operations UpdateThe outbreak of COVID-19 and its development into a pandemic in March 2020 has resulted in significant economic disruption globally, including in North America, Europe, and Latin America, the primary geographic areas where we operate. In March, governmental authorities around the world took actions, such as stay-at-home orders and other social distancing measures, to slow the spread of COVID-19 that restricted travel, public gatherings, and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction across the globe. These actions significantly reduced global economic activity and negatively impacted many businesses, including our business. Airlines have dramatically reduced flights and motor vehicle usage has significantly declined, in each case relative to typical pre-pandemic levels. As a result, in the first half of 2020, there was a decline in the demand for, and thus also the market prices of, most of the transportation fuels that we produce and sell. There was also a decline in the global demand for crude oil, the primary feedstock for our refined products, resulting in a decline in crude oil prices and production levels. While the production levels of all types of crude oils have declined, sour crude oil production has declined significantly and by more than production levels for sweet crude oils. This has reduced the price advantage of sour crude oils relative to sweet crude oils, which has exacerbated the negative impact of lower product prices on our refining margin.6,7Beginning in the latter part of the second quarter, certain governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries across the world, particularly those in our U.S. Gulf Coast and U.S. Mid-Continent regions, began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19, while governmental authorities in our U.S. West Coast and North Atlantic regions began lifting restrictions on a more moderate basis during the third quarter. This resulted in an increase in the level of individual movement and travel and, in turn, an increase in the demand and market prices for most of our products relative to what we experienced during the early months of the pandemic. However, in the second half of 2020, many locations where restrictions were lifted, and others where the restrictions were only more moderately lifted (such as California in our U.S. West Coast region, and New York, Canada, and the U.K. in our North Atlantic region), experienced a resurgence in the spread of COVID-19, which prompted many governmental authorities to reimpose certain restrictions. In December 2020, the U.S. FDA and Canadian and U.K. regulators each granted emergency-use authorization for multiple COVID-19 vaccines to be used as immunization against the COVID-19 virus. Although these vaccines may be seen as a key factor in helping to restore public confidence, and thus stimulate and increase economic activity, potentially to pre-pandemic levels, they may not be distributed widely on a timely basis and they may not be effective against new variants of the virus. Based on these and other circumstances that cannot be predicted, the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and financial position remain uncertain.As previously noted, the decrease in the demand for transportation fuels has resulted in a significant decrease in the price of refined petroleum products manufactured by our refining segment. For example, the price of gasoline8 in the U.S. Gulf Coast region where eight of our 15 refineries are located was $68.82 per barrel at the beginning of 2020, fell to $17.65 per barrel at the end of March (a 74 percent decline), and partially recovered to $57.63 per barrel by the end of December (a 16 percent decline over 6 See page 46 for our definition of refining margin and why we believe it is an important financial and operating measure.7 Sour crude oils typically sell at a discount to the price of benchmark sweet crude oils, which set the price of most refined products. Therefore, lower prices for sour crude oils that we process have a favorable impact on our refining margin.8 Gasoline prices quoted represent the price of U.S. Gulf Coast conventional blendstock of oxygenate blending gasoline.33Table of Contentsthe twelve-month period). Another example is the price of diesel9 in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, which was $81.71 per barrel at the beginning of 2020, fell to $39.18 per barrel at the end of March (a 52 percent decline), and partially recovered to $60.20 per barrel by the end of December (a 26 percent decline over the twelve-month period). On February 22, 2021, the prices of gasoline and diesel were $76.62 per barrel and $76.84 per barrel, respectively.Demand for renewable diesel has not declined due to continued demand for this low-carbon transportation fuel despite the current economic environment; therefore, our renewable diesel segment has not been impacted as were our refining and ethanol segments.The price of ethanol manufactured by our ethanol segment has also decreased due to a decline in demand. Because ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline, ethanol demand declined along with the decline in the demand for gasoline.Prices for the products we sell and the feedstocks we purchase impact our revenues, cost of sales, operating income, and liquidity. In addition, a decline in the market prices of products and feedstocks below their carrying values in our inventory results in a writedown in the value of our inventories, and a subsequent recovery in market prices results in a write-up in the value of our inventories, not to exceed their previous carrying values. These inventory valuation adjustments are referred to as LCM inventory valuation adjustments and are described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We wrote down the value of our inventories by $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2020 due to the significant decline in market prices at that time, but as market prices improved, the writedown was fully reversed by the end of the third quarter.For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated an operating loss of $1.6 billion. Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, including operating results by segment, are described in the summary below, and detailed descriptions can be found under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” on pages 37 through 49.Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $730 million during 2020, from $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 to $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2020. We invested $2.4 billion in our business and returned $1.8 billion to our stockholders primarily through dividend payments. These uses of cash were offset by proceeds from two public debt offerings totaling $4.0 billion before deducting the underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs as described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, our operations generated net cash of $948 million, which was driven by a decrease in inventory on hand. We had $9.0 billion of liquidity10 as of December 31, 2020. A summary of our cash flows is presented on page 50, and a description of our cash flows and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources, including measures we have taken to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity, can be found under “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES” on pages 49 through 55.We have responded in multiple ways to the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and we will strive to continue to respond to these impacts. During the early months of the pandemic, we reduced the amount of crude oil processed at most of our refineries in response to the decreased demand for our products, we temporarily idled various gasoline-making units at certain of our refineries to further limit gasoline production, and we took measures to reduce jet fuel production. We also temporarily idled 9 Diesel prices quoted represent the price of U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low sulfur diesel.10 See the components of our liquidity as of December 31, 2020 in the table on page 50 under “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES—Our Liquidity.”34Table of Contentseight of our ethanol plants and reduced production at our other ethanol plants, in each case in order to address the decreased demand for ethanol. We have since increased the production of most of our products to align with increasing demand, and we restarted the gasoline-making units and most of the ethanol plants that had been temporarily idled. Demand for our products taken as a whole, however, has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, and as of December 31, 2020, our refineries and plants are operating to meet current product demand. In addition to these measures and the issuances of an aggregate of $4.0 billion of debt previously noted, we have addressed our liquidity as outlined below:•We deferred projects representing approximately $500 million of capital investments that we had expected to make in 2020 related to our refining and ethanol segments.•We deferred income and indirect (e.g., VAT and motor fuel taxes) tax payments of approximately $440 million due in the first and second quarters of 2020. These deferrals were provided to taxpayers under new legislation, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the U.S., and by various taxing authorities under existing legislation. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $250 million of deferred tax payments. Of the $250 million, approximately 70 percent will be paid in 2021 and 30 percent in 2022.•We have not purchased any shares of our common stock under our stock purchase program since mid-March 2020, and we will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate. We have no obligation to make purchases under our stock purchase program.•We entered into a 364-day Revolving Credit Facility on April 13, 2020 with an aggregate principal amount of up to $875 million as described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2020 and February 22, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility.•We extended the maturity date of our accounts receivable sales facility to July 2021 and decreased the facility amount from $1.3 billion to $1.0 billion as described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2020 and February 22, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility.Many uncertainties remain with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, including its resulting economic effects, and we are unable to predict the ultimate economic impacts from the pandemic on our business and how quickly national economies can recover once the pandemic subsides, the timing or effectiveness of vaccine distributions, or whether any recovery will ultimately experience a reversal or other setbacks. However, the adverse impacts of the economic effects on our company have been and will likely continue to be significant. We believe we have proactively addressed many of the known impacts of the pandemic to the extent possible and we will strive to continue to do so, but there can be no assurance that these or other measures will be fully effective.Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2020For 2020, we reported a net loss attributable to Valero stockholders of $1.4 billion compared to net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $2.4 billion for 2019, which represents a decrease of $3.8 billion. The decrease was primarily due to lower operating income of $5.4 billion, partially offset by a $1.6 billion decrease in income taxes. The decrease in operating income included a $224 million charge for the impact of a liquidation of LIFO inventory layers, which is described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in note (a) on page 44.35Table of ContentsWhile our operating income decreased by $5.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, adjusted operating income decreased by $5.0 billion. Adjusted operating income excludes the LIFO liquidation adjustment and other adjustments to operating income reflected in the table in note (f) on page 49.The $5.0 billion decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to the following:•Refining segment. Refining segment adjusted operating income decreased by $5.1 billion primarily due to decreases in gasoline and distillate margins, lower throughput volumes, and the higher cost of biofuel credits, partially offset by higher margins on other products and lower operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense). This is more fully described on pages 41 and 42.•Renewable diesel segment. Renewable diesel segment adjusted operating income increased by $62 million primarily due to a favorable impact from commodity derivative instruments associated with our price risk management activities. This is more fully described on page 43.•Ethanol segment. Ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased by $40 million primarily due to lower ethanol prices and production volumes, partially offset by higher prices on corn related co-products, lower corn prices, and lower operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense). This is more fully described on pages 43 and 44.OutlookAs previously discussed, many uncertainties remain with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, and while it is difficult to predict the ultimate economic impacts that the pandemic will have on us and how quickly we can recover once the pandemic subsides, we have noted several factors below that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2021.•Gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel prices are expected to improve as industry-wide excess inventory levels continue to draw toward historical levels and product demand recovers.•Sour crude oil discounts are not expected to improve until OPEC production is increased in response to any growth in global oil demand.•Renewable diesel margins are expected to remain consistent with current levels.•Ethanol margins are expected to decline.As a result of Brexit in June 2016, the U.K. withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020 consistent with the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. In late December 2020, the European Commission reached a trade agreement with the U.K. on the terms of its future cooperation with the EU. The trade agreement offers U.K. and EU companies preferential access to each other’s markets, ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas (subject to rules of origin requirements). Although the ultimate impact of this trade agreement is currently unknown, we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our operations in the U.K.In mid-February 2021, the U.S. Gulf Coast and U.S. Mid-Continent regions experienced a severe winter storm that disrupted the operation of industrial facilities like refineries, plants, and logistical assets, including ours located in those regions. Most facilities experienced curtailments or outages of various utilities and other services necessary for such facilities to remain operational. All of our facilities in those 36Table of Contentsregions were impacted to some extent by the severe cold and/or supply and utility disruptions.

The decrease in revenues was partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales of $37.9 billion and a decrease in general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) of $112 million, which resulted in a $5.4 billion decrease in operating income, from $3.8 billion of operating income in 2019 to an operating loss of $1.6 billion in 2020. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to decreases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, partially offset by the $224 million LIFO liquidation adjustment, which is described in note (a) on page 44.Adjusted operating income decreased by $5.0 billion, from $3.7 billion of adjusted operating income in 2019 to an adjusted operating loss of $1.3 billion in 2020. The $5.0 billion decrease includes a $112 million decrease in general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization 40Table of Contentsexpense) associated with our corporate activities, and this decrease is discussed below. The remaining components of the decrease in adjusted operating income are discussed by segment in the segment analysis that follows.General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) decreased by $112 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in employee incentive compensation expenses of $37 million, a decrease in charitable contributions of $20 million, lower advertising expenses of $18 million, and lower taxes other than income taxes of $16 million, as well as the effect from transaction costs of $7 million associated with the Merger Transaction with VLP in 2019.“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” increased by $109 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to interest expense associated with public debt offerings in 2020 and finance leases that commenced in the latter part of 2019 and the first nine months of 2020. See Notes 6 and 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Income tax expense decreased by $1.6 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate was 45 percent in 2020 compared to 20 percent in 2019. The effective tax rate for 2020 was impacted by a U.S. federal tax net operating loss (NOL) carried back to 2015 when the U.S. federal statutory rate was 35 percent, as described in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $48 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower earnings associated with DGD. The decrease in DGD’s earnings is primarily due to the effect of a $156 million benefit for the 2018 blender’s tax credit recognized in 2019, of which 50 percent is attributable to the holder of the noncontrolling interest, as described in note (b) on page 44.Refining Segment ResultsThe following table includes selected financial and operating data of our refining segment for 2020 and 2019. The selected financial data is derived from the Financial Highlights by Segment and Total Company tables on pages 37 and 38, respectively, unless otherwise noted.Year Ended December 31,20202019ChangeOperating income (loss)$(1,342)$4,022 $(5,364)Adjusted operating income (loss) (see note (f) on page 48)(1,105)4,040 (5,145)Refining margin (see note (f) on page 46)$4,977 $10,391 $(5,414)Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense reflected below)3,944 4,289 (345)Depreciation and amortization expense2,138 2,062 76 Throughput volumes (thousand BPD) (see note (g) on page 49)2,555 2,952 (397)Refining segment operating income decreased by $5.4 billion in 2020; however, refining segment adjusted operating income, which excludes the adjustments in the table in note (f) on page 48, decreased 41Table of Contentsby $5.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The components of this decrease, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are outlined below.•Refining segment margin decreased by $5.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. Refining segment margin is primarily affected by the prices of the refined petroleum products that we sell and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we process. The table on page 39 reflects market reference prices and differentials that we believe had a material impact on the change in our refining segment margin in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in refining segment margin was primarily due to the following:◦A decrease in distillate (primarily diesel) margins had an unfavorable impact of approximately $3.4 billion. ◦A decrease in gasoline margins had an unfavorable impact of approximately $1.7 billion.◦A decrease in throughput volumes of 397,000 BPD had an unfavorable impact of $773 million. As noted in “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK—Overview—Business Operations Update” on pages 33 through 35, as a result of the economic disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced the amount of crude oil processed at our refineries and limited the production of gasoline and jet fuel at certain of our refineries during the early months of the pandemic. While we have since increased the production of most of our products and restarted the gasoline-making units that we had temporarily idled at certain of our refineries in order to align with increasing demand for most of our products, we expect to continue to operate most of our refineries at reduced rates.◦An increase in the cost of biofuel credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) had an unfavorable impact of $330 million. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our government and regulatory compliance programs.◦Higher margins on other products had a favorable impact of approximately $1.1 billion.•Refining segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) decreased by $345 million primarily due to lower natural gas and electricity costs of $161 million, lower chemical and catalyst costs of $78 million, lower maintenance expenses of $40 million, and lower employee incentive compensation costs of $28 million. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower production.•Refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased by $76 million primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense of $118 million associated with capital projects that were completed and finance leases that commenced in the latter part of 2019 and the first nine months of 2020, partially offset by lower refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense of $33 million.42Table of ContentsRenewable Diesel Segment ResultsThe following table includes selected financial and operating data of our renewable diesel segment for 2020 and 2019. The selected financial data is derived from the Financial Highlights by Segment and Total Company tables on pages 37 and 38, respectively, unless otherwise noted.Year Ended December 31,20202019ChangeOperating income$638 $732 $(94)Adjusted operating income (see note (f) on page 48)638 576 62 Renewable diesel margin (see note (f) on page 47)$767 $701 $66 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation andamortization expense reflected below)85 75 10 Depreciation and amortization expense44 50 (6)Sales volumes (thousand gallons per day)(see note (g) on page 49)787 760 27 Renewable diesel segment operating income decreased by $94 million in 2020; however, renewable diesel segment adjusted operating income, which excludes the adjustment in the table in note (f) on page 48, increased by $62 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher renewable diesel segment margin.Renewable diesel segment margin increased by $66 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to a favorable impact from commodity derivative instruments associated with our price risk management activities. We recognized a hedge gain of $34 million in 2020 compared to a hedge loss of $24 million in 2019, resulting in a favorable change of $58 million between the years.Ethanol Segment ResultsThe following table includes selected financial and operating data of our ethanol segment for 2020 and 2019. The selected financial data is derived from the Financial Highlights by Segment and Total Company tables on pages 37 and 38, respectively, unless otherwise noted.Year Ended December 31,20202019ChangeOperating income (loss)$(69)$3 $(72)Adjusted operating income (loss) (see note (f) on page 48)(36)4 (40)Ethanol margin (see note (f) on page 47)$461 $598 $(137)Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense reflected below)406 504 (98)Depreciation and amortization expense (see note (d) onpage 45)121 90 31 Production volumes (thousand gallons per day) (see note (g) on page 49)3,588 4,269 (681)43Table of ContentsEthanol segment operating income decreased by $72 million in 2020; however, ethanol segment adjusted operating income, which excludes the adjustments in the table in note (f) on page 48, decreased by $40 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The components of this decrease, along with the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.•Ethanol segment margin decreased by $137 million in 2020 compared to 2019.Ethanol segment margin is primarily affected by prices of the ethanol and corn related co-products that we sell and the cost of corn that we process. The table on page 40 reflects market reference prices that we believe had a material impact on the change in our ethanol segment margin in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in ethanol segment margin was primarily due to the following:◦Lower ethanol prices had an unfavorable impact of approximately $166 million.◦A decrease in production volumes of 681,000 gallons per day had an unfavorable impact of approximately $92 million. As noted in “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK—Overview—Business Operations Update” on pages 33 through 35, as a result of the economic disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, eight of our ethanol plants were temporarily idled and production was reduced at our remaining ethanol plants during the early months of the pandemic. However, demand for ethanol began to recover during the latter part of 2020, and as a result, most of our ethanol plants have recently increased production to meet current product demand.◦Higher prices on the co-products that we produce, primarily DDGs, had a favorable impact of approximately $79 million.◦Lower corn prices had a favorable impact of approximately $45 million.•Ethanol segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) decreased by $98 million primarily due to lower natural gas and electricity costs of $43 million, lower chemical and catalyst costs of $23 million, and lower maintenance expenses of $15 million. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower production.________________________The following notes relate to references on pages 32 through 44.(a)Cost of materials and other for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a charge of $224 million related to the liquidation of LIFO inventory layers attributable to our refining and ethanol segments. Our inventory levels decreased throughout 2020 due to lower production resulting from lower demand for our products caused by the negative economic impacts of COVID-19 on our business. As a result, our inventory levels at December 31, 2020 were below their December 31, 2019 levels. Of the $224 million charge recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020, $222 million and $2 million is attributable to our refining and ethanol segments, respectively.(b)Cost of materials and other for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 includes a benefit related to the blender’s tax credit. The legislation authorizing the credit through December 31, 2022 was passed and signed into law in December 2019. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a benefit of $297 million related to the blender’s tax credit attributable to renewable diesel volumes blended during 2020. The legislation also reinstated the credit retroactively to volumes blended during 2019 and 2018, and 44Table of Contentsconsequently, we recognized a benefit of $449 million in December 2019 for the blender’s tax credit attributable to volumes blended during those two years. The entire amount was recognized by us in December 2019 because the law was enacted in that month. The above-mentioned pre-tax benefits are attributable to our reportable segments and stockholders as follows:Year Ended December 31,20202019Blender’s tax credit by reportable segmentRefining:Amount related to reporting period$9 $16 Amount related to prior periods but recognized in reportingperiod— 2 Total9 18 Renewable diesel:Amount related to reporting period288 275 Amount related to prior periods but recognized in reportingperiod— 156 Total288 431 Total recognized in reporting period$297 $449 Interests to which blender’s tax credit is attributableValero Energy Corporation stockholders:Amount related to reporting period$153 $154 Amount related to prior periods but recognized in reportingperiod— 80 Total153 234 Noncontrolling interest:Amount related to reporting period144 137 Amount related to prior periods but recognized in reportingperiod— 78 Total144 215 Total recognized in reporting period$297 $449 (c)The market value of our inventories accounted for under the LIFO method fell below their historical cost on an aggregate basis as of March 31, 2020. As a result, we recorded an LCM inventory valuation adjustment of $2.5 billion in March 2020. The market value of our LIFO inventories improved due to the subsequent recovery in market prices, which resulted in a full reversal of the reserve by September 30, 2020. The LCM inventory valuation adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects a net benefit of $19 million due solely to the foreign currency translation effect of the portion of the LCM inventory valuation adjustments attributable to our international operations.(d)Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $30 million in accelerated depreciation related to a change in the estimated useful life of one of our ethanol plants. (e)“Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a $22 million charge from the early redemption of $850 million of our 6.125 percent senior notes due February 1, 2020.45Table of Contents(f)We use certain financial measures (as noted below) that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.We have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes their utility.Non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:◦Refining margin is defined as refining operating income (loss) excluding the blender’s tax credit not attributable to volumes blended during the applicable period,

liquidity was negatively impacted by the significant economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as described in “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK—Overview—Business Operations Update.” However, we took a number of actions to address the economic environment and its impact on our liquidity, most notably two public debt offerings totaling $4.0 billion before deducting the underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs, which are described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We took other actions to address our liquidity and those actions are described in “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK—Overview—Business Operations Update” on pages 33 through 35 and in the discussion of matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources below. As a result of the actions taken during 2020, our liquidity position has improved as of December 31, 2020 compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020, which was when the pandemic began to have a negative impact on our business.49Table of ContentsOur LiquidityOur liquidity consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):Available borrowing capacity from committed facilities:Valero Revolver$3,966 364-day Revolving Credit Facility875 Canadian Revolver(a)114 Accounts receivable sales facility885 Letter of credit facility50 Total available borrowing capacity5,890 Cash and cash equivalents(b)3,152 Total liquidity$9,042 ________________________(a)The amount for our Canadian Revolver is shown in U.S. dollars. As set forth in the summary of our credit facilities in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the availability under our Canadian Revolver as of December 31, 2020 in Canadian dollars was C$145 million.(b)Excludes $161 million of cash and cash equivalents related to our variable interest entities (VIEs) that is available for use only by our VIEs.Information about our outstanding borrowings, letters of credit issued, and availability under our credit facilities is reflected in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that cash provided by operations, along with cash from our public debt offerings in April and September of 2020 and available borrowings under our credit facilities, is sufficient to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional cash through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.Cash FlowsComponents of our cash flows are set forth below (in millions):Year Ended December 31,20202019Cash flows provided by (used in):Operating activities$948 $5,531 Investing activities(2,425)(3,001)Financing activities:Borrowings4,570 2,131 Other financing activities(2,493)(5,128)Financing activities2,077 (2,997)Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash130 68 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$730 $(399)50Table of ContentsCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2020During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $948 million of cash generated by our operations and $4.6 billion in borrowings to make $2.4 billion of investments in our business, fund $2.5 billion of other financing activities, and increase our available cash on hand by $730 million. The borrowings are described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.As previously noted, our operations generated $948 million of cash in 2020, which was negatively impacted by an unfavorable change in working capital of $345 million. The change in working capital was affected primarily by a $740 million use of cash11 resulting from the rapid decline in market prices of refined petroleum products and crude oil as a result of the negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that impacted our receivables and accounts payable. This use of cash, along with other uses of cash, were partially offset by a $1.0 billion source of cash driven by a reduction in inventory levels on hand. Details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for an analysis of our net loss.Our investing activities of $2.4 billion consisted of $2.5 billion in capital investments, as defined below, of which $548 million related to self-funded capital investments by DGD, and $251 million was related to capital expenditures of VIEs other than DGD.Other financing activities of $2.5 billion consisted primarily of $1.6 billion in dividend payments, $490 million of payments of debt and finance lease obligations, $208 million to pay distributions to noncontrolling interests, and $156 million for the purchase of common stock for treasury.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2019During the year ended December 31, 2019, we used $5.5 billion of cash generated by our operations, $2.1 billion in borrowings, and $399 million of cash on hand to make $3.0 billion of investments in our business and fund $5.1 billion of other financing activities. The borrowings are described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.As previously noted, our operations generated $5.5 billion of cash in 2019, driven primarily by net income of $2.8 billion, noncash charges to income of $2.5 billion, and a positive change in working capital of $294 million. Details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for an analysis of our net income.Our investing activities of $3.0 billion consisted primarily of $2.9 billion in capital investments, as defined below, of which $160 million is related to self-funded capital investments by DGD, and $225 million was related to capital expenditures of VIEs other than DGD.Other financing activities of $5.1 billion consisted primarily of $1.8 billion of payments of debt and finance lease obligations, $1.5 billion in dividend payments, $950 million to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common units of VLP, and $777 million for the purchase of common stock for treasury.11 Represents the net cash flow change in “receivables, net” of $3.3 billion and accounts payable of $4.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020, as described in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.51Table of ContentsCapital InvestmentsOur operations are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries and plants comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil and other feedstock processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are improved continuously. The cost of improvements, which consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, can be significant. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly.Our capital investments include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Capital investments attributable to Valero, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, reflects our net share of capital investments and is defined as all capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the portion of DGD’s capital investments attributable to our joint venture partner and all of the capital expenditures of other VIEs.We are a 50/50 joint venture partner in DGD and consolidate DGD’s financial statements; as a result, all of DGD’s net cash provided by operating activities (or operating cash flow) is included in our consolidated net cash provided by operating activities. DGD’s partners use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Because DGD’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each partner, only 50 percent of DGD’s capital investments should be attributed to our net share of capital investments. We also exclude the capital expenditures of our other consolidated VIEs because we do not operate those VIEs. We believe capital investments attributable to Valero is an important measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments.52Table of ContentsCapital investments attributable to Valero should not be considered as an alternative to capital investments, its most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our cash flows as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define it differently, which may diminish its utility.Year Ended December 31,20202019Reconciliation of capital investmentsto capital investments attributable to ValeroCapital expenditures (excluding VIEs)$1,014 $1,627 Capital expenditures of VIEs:DGD523 142 Other VIEs251 225 Deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures(excluding VIEs)623 762 Deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expendituresof DGD25 18 Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures54 164 Capital investments2,490 2,938 Adjustments:DGD’s capital investments attributable to our jointventure partner(274)(80)Capital expenditures of other VIEs(251)(225)Capital investments attributable to Valero$1,965 $2,633 We expect to incur capital investments and capital investments attributable to Valero in 2021 as follows by reportable segment (in millions):Refining$1,600 Renewable diesel720 Ethanol40 Corporate25 Capital investments2,385 Adjustments:DGD’s capital investments attributable to our joint venture partner(360)Capital expenditures of other VIEs(25)Capital investments attributable to Valero$2,000 Approximately 60 percent of the capital investments attributable to Valero are for sustaining the business and 40 percent are for growth strategies, almost half of which is allocated to expanding the renewable diesel business. However, we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. This capital investment estimate excludes strategic acquisitions, if any.53Table of ContentsOther Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Purchase ProgramOn January 23, 2018, our board of directors authorized the 2018 Program for the purchase of our outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.4 billion available for purchase under the 2018 Program, which has no expiration date. We have not purchased any shares of our common stock under the 2018 Program since mid-March 2020, and we will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate. We have no obligation to make purchases under this program.Pension Plan FundingWe plan to contribute $128 million to our pension plans and $22 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2021. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our employee benefit plans.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries or plants could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of our environmental liabilities.Tax MattersUnder deferrals provided by recently passed legislation, such as the CARES Act in the U.S., and by various taxing authorities under other existing legislation, we deferred approximately $440 million of income and indirect (e.g., VAT and motor fuel taxes) tax payments due in the first and second quarters of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $250 million of deferred tax payments. Of the $250 million, approximately 70 percent will be paid in 2021 and 30 percent in 2022.We take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority. When we take such positions, we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions, if any, that should be recognized in our financial statements. Tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained.As of December 31, 2020, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, was $821 million. Of this amount, $525 million is associated with refund claims associated with taxes paid on incentive payments received from the U.S. federal government for blending biofuels into refined petroleum products. We recorded a tax refund receivable of $525 million in connection with our refund claims, but we also recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $525 million due to the complexity of this matter and uncertainties with respect to sustaining these refund claims. Therefore, our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity will not be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in sustaining these refund claims. The remaining liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, of $296 million represents our potential future obligations to various taxing authorities if the tax positions associated with that liability are not sustained.54Table of ContentsDetails about our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits, are included in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash Held by Our International SubsidiariesAs of December 31, 2020, $2.5 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our international subsidiaries. Cash held by our international subsidiaries can be repatriated to us without any U.S. federal income tax consequences, but certain other taxes may apply, including, but not limited to, withholding taxes imposed by certain international jurisdictions and U.S. state income taxes. Therefore, there is a cost to repatriate cash held by certain of our international subsidiaries to us, but we believe that such amount is not material to our financial position or liquidity.Concentration of CustomersOur operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions including the uncertainties concerning the COVID-19 pandemic and volatility in the global oil markets. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. See also Item 1A, “RISK FACTORS”—Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Operations—Developments with respect to low-carbon fuel policies and the market for alternative fuels may affect demand for our renewable fuels and could adversely affect our financial performance.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are summarized below (in millions).Payments Due by Year20212022202320242025ThereafterTotalDebt and financelease obligations (a)$790 $188 $1,632 $1,103 $1,828 $9,972 $15,513 Debt obligations – interestpayments550 544 524 501 469 3,544 6,132 Operating lease liabilities (b)324 231 194 155 107 435 1,446 Purchase obligations14,641 1,871 1,268 1,246 1,124 2,445 22,595 Other long-term liabilities (c)— 129 225 235 259 1,887 2,735 Total$16,305 $2,963 $3,843 $3,240 $3,787 $18,283 $48,421 ________________________(a)Debt obligations exclude amounts related to unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. Finance lease obligations include related interest expense. Debt obligations due in 2021 include $598 million associated with borrowings under the IEnova Revolver (as defined and described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) for the construction of terminals in Mexico by Central Mexico Terminals (as defined and described 55Table of Contentsin Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The IEnova Revolver is only available to the operations of Central Mexico Terminals, and its creditors do not have recourse against us.(b)Operating lease liabilities include related interest expense.(c)Other long-term liabilities exclude amounts related to the long-term portion of operating lease liabilities that are separately presented above.Debt and Finance Lease ObligationsOur debt and finance lease obligations are described in Notes 10 and 6, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements may increase. As of December 31, 2020, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt, including debt guaranteed by us, are at or above investment grade level as follows:Rating AgencyRatingMoody’s Investors ServiceBaa2 (negative outlook)Standard & Poor’s Ratings ServicesBBB (negative outlook)Fitch RatingsBBB (negative outlook)We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.Debt Obligations – Interest PaymentsInterest payments for our debt obligations as described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are the expected payments based on information available as of December 31, 2020.Operating Lease LiabilitiesOur operating lease liabilities arise from leasing arrangements for the right to use various classes of underlying assets as described in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating lease liabilities are recognized for leasing arrangements with terms greater than one year and are not reduced by minimum lease payments to be received by us under subleases.Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations under certain crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, industrial gas supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), natural gas supply arrangements, and various throughput, transportation and terminaling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of feedstock and utilities and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries and plants. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the 56Table of Contentspreceding table include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (ii) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions.Other Long-Term LiabilitiesOur other long-term liabilities are described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the preceding table, we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2020.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAs discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements became effective in 2020 and January 2021. The effect on our financial statements upon adoption of these pronouncements is discussed in the above-referenced note.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes.Unrecognized Tax BenefitsWe take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority. When we take such positions, we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions, if any, that should be recognized in our financial statements. Tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained.The evaluation of tax positions and the determination of the benefit arising from such positions that are recognized in our financial statements requires us to make significant judgments and estimates based on an analysis of complex tax laws and regulations and related interpretations. These judgments and estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and changes in legislation.Details of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits, are included in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and GoodwillLong-lived assets (primarily property, plant, and equipment) are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. A 57Table of Contentslong-lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, with fair value determined based on discounted estimated net cash flows or other appropriate methods.In order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated; such estimates include, but are not limited to, assumptions about future sales volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, the use or disposition of the asset, the asset’s estimated remaining useful life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings.Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. We first evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, by taking into consideration relevant events and circumstances. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. However, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value. During 2020, we performed qualitative assessments of the reporting unit to which our goodwill is related to determine if the quantitative impairment test was necessary. We considered company-specific information, such as current and future financial performance, as well as external factors, that could affect the fair value of the reporting unit. We evaluated (i) the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the demand for our products and utilization of our U.S. refineries, (ii) the expected contribution from the reporting unit, which historically has had strong performance, and (iii) the estimated margin between the carrying amount and the implied enterprise value of our reporting unit. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for impairment, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings.As of December 31, 2020, we determined there was no impairment of our long-lived assets or goodwill as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of feedstocks (primarily crude oil and corn), the products we produce (primarily refined petroleum products), and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including futures and options to manage the volatility of:•inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a LIFO basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels; and58Table of Contents•forecasted purchases and/or product sales at existing market prices that we deem favorable.Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of gain or loss that would have resulted from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price for all of our commodity derivative instruments entered into for purposes other than trading with which we have market risk was not material. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2020.COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory environmental compliance programs. To manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would have resulted from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts was not material. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs.INTEREST RATE RISKThe following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented.

The IEnova Revolver is only available to the operations of Central Mexico Terminals, and its creditors do not have recourse against us.59Table of Contents(b)As of December 31, 2020, our floating rate debt also includes $575 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Notes issued in September 2020, which are due September 15, 2023.(c)Excludes unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs.(d)As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had an interest rate swap associated with $31 million and $36 million, respectively, of our floating rate debt resulting in an effective interest rate of 3.85 percent as of each of those reporting dates. The fair value of the swap was immaterial for all periods presented.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKWe are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our international operations that are denominated in currencies other than the local (functional) currencies of those operations. To manage our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, we use foreign currency contracts. The following table provides information about our foreign currency contracts (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Contracts that were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 mature on or before April 15, 2021 and those outstanding as of December 31, 2019 matured in 2020.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Items 1, 1A and 2, “Business, Risk Factors and Properties,” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” included in this report. In the discussions that follow, all per-share amounts assume dilution. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report, including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading “Results of Operations - Outlook,” includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “projection,” “predict,” “budget,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “target,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “may,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding: • future refining margins, including gasoline and distillate margins; • future retail margins, including gasoline, diesel, home heating oil, and convenience store merchandise margins; • expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil differentials, and operating expenses; • anticipated levels of crude oil and refined product inventories; • our anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred refinery turnaround and catalyst costs and capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and the effect of those capital investments on our results of operations; • anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere; • expectations regarding environmental, tax, and other regulatory initiatives; and • the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining and retail industry fundamentals. We based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined products or receive feedstocks; • political and economic conditions in nations that consume refined products, including the United States, and in crude oil producing regions, including the Middle East and South America; • the domestic and foreign supplies of refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil, and petrochemicals; • the domestic and foreign supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks; • the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls; • the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations; • refinery overcapacity or undercapacity; 22 Table of Contents • the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and the expansion and retirement of refining capacity in response to market conditions; • environmental, tax, and other regulations at the municipal, state, and federal levels and in foreign countries; • the level of foreign imports of refined products; • accidents or other unscheduled shutdowns affecting our refineries, machinery, pipelines, or equipment, or those of our suppliers or customers; • changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined products; • the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles; • delay of, cancellation of, or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects; • earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil and other feedstocks, and refined products; • rulings, judgments, or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs, in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage; • legislative or regulatory action, including the introduction or enactment of federal, state, municipal, or foreign legislation or rulemakings, which may adversely affect our business or operations; • changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and trade credit; • changes in currency exchange rates, including the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar; and • overall economic conditions. Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 23 Table of Contents OVERVIEW The strong industry fundamentals we experienced throughout 2005 continued during 2006, resulting in the highest net income in our history of $5.5 billion, 52% higher than the net income reported in 2005. Our profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the “refined product margin.” Refined product margins for the year 2006, both for gasoline and distillates, were comparable to the strong margins realized in 2005. Heavy industry-wide turnaround activity, the implementation of more restrictive sulfur regulations on gasoline and diesel, increased use of ethanol and decreased use of MTBE in the reformulated gasoline pool, and limited capacity expansions due to the high cost of compliance with environmental regulations resulted in tighter supplies of refined products and strong margins during most of 2006. Since approximately 60% of our total crude oil throughput represents sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that are purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil, our profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the “sour crude oil differential.” Sour crude oil differentials for 2006 were also about as wide as the very favorable differentials experienced in 2005. In addition to these continuing strong industry fundamentals, we benefited significantly from the addition of the four former Premcor refineries, which generated $2.5 billion of operating income, or 31% of our total operating income of $8.0 billion, with average throughput volumes of 792,000 barrels per day during 2006. In addition to the operating income effects discussed above, we monetized our entire ownership interest in Valero L.P. by selling all of our units in Valero GP Holdings, LLC during 2006, generating proceeds of $880 million and recognizing a pre-tax gain of $328 million. This sale, along with our favorable operating results, resulted in a strong balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. We reduced debt by $245 million during 2006 and increased our cash balance to $1.6 billion at year-end, while at the same time purchasing $2.0 billion, or approximately 5%, of our outstanding shares.

(a) Includes the operations related to the Premcor Acquisition commencing on September 1, 2005. Cost of sales and refining operating income presented for the year ended December 31, 2005 include the effect of a $621 million LIFO charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying Valero’s LIFO accounting policy. This charge was excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented herein in order to make the information presented comparable between periods. (b) As described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, amounts previously reported in 2005 for refining operating expenses, retail selling expenses, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense, as well as related segment and regional amounts, have been reclassified for comparability with amounts reported in 2006. (c) Operating revenues and cost of sales both include approximately $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to certain crude oil buy/sell arrangements, which involve linked purchases and sales related to crude oil contracts entered into to address location, quality, or grade requirements. Commencing January 1, 2006, we adopted EITF Issue No. 04-13 which requires that such buy/sell arrangements be accounted for as one transaction, thereby resulting in no recognition of revenues and cost of sales for these transactions. (d) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (e) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (f) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries subsequent to the Premcor Acquisition: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, Memphis, and Lima Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (g) Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Northeast regions for the year ended December 31, 2006 include 287,000, 304,000, and 201,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor on September 1, 2005. Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Northeast regions for the year ended December 31, 2005 include 78,000, 106,000, and 63,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor commencing on September 1, 2005. Throughput volumes for those acquired refineries for the 122 days of their operations subsequent to the acquisition date of September 1, 2005 were 234,000, 317,000, and 187,000 barrels per day, respectively, for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Northeast regions. 28 Table of Contents (h) The information presented for the Mid-Continent region for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes the operations of the Denver Refinery, which was sold on May 31, 2005 to Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc. Throughput volumes for the Mid-Continent region for the year ended December 31, 2005 include 15,000 barrels per day related to the Denver Refinery. (i) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services-London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (j) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues increased 12% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from the former Premcor refinery operations. Operating income and net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating income increased $2.6 billion, or 47%, from 2005 to 2006 due to a $2.6 billion increase in the refining segment and a $28 million increase in the retail segment, partially offset by a $47 million increase in general and administrative expenses (including corporate depreciation and amortization expense). Refining Operating income for our refining segment increased from $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $8.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulting from a 19% increase in throughput volumes and an increase in refining throughput margin of $1.15 per barrel, or 10%, partially offset by increased refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense) of $1.2 billion. In addition, the increase in the 2006 results was partially attributable to the unfavorable impact in 2005 of a $621 million pre-tax LIFO charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying Valero’s LIFO accounting policy. The change in refining throughput margin for 2006 compared to 2005 was impacted by the following factors: • Throughput volumes increased 472,000 barrels per day during 2006 compared to 2005 due to 545,000 barrels per day of incremental throughput from the four former Premcor refineries, offset to some extent by the sale of the Denver Refinery in 2005 and significant planned and unplanned downtime at several of our refineries in 2006. • Overall, gasoline and distillate margins increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to significantly improved margins in the first half of 2006 attributable to increased foreign and U.S. demand, limited capacity additions, major industry turnaround activity, and continuing outages from last season’s hurricanes. However, the 2006 increase in gasoline and distillate margins was somewhat diminished in the second half of 2006 due to excess refined product supply and the higher margins experienced in September and October of 2005 due to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. • Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks during 2006 were essentially unchanged from the strong differentials in 2005, and remained wide due to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for gasoline and diesel and a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which has resulted in higher utilization rates by refineries that require sweet crude oil as feedstock. • Throughput margin improved in 2006 due to the negative impact in 2005 of pre-tax losses of approximately $525 million on hedges related to forward sales of distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil. 29 Table of Contents • Margins on other refined products such as petroleum coke and sulfur were lower in 2006 due to an increase in the price of crude oil from 2005 to 2006. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 32% higher for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, due primarily to the Premcor Acquisition on September 1, 2005. Excluding the effect of the Premcor Acquisition, operating expenses increased 5% due mainly to increases in maintenance expense, employee compensation and related benefits, outside services, and catalyst and chemicals, partially offset by reduced energy costs. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 42% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the Premcor Acquisition, the implementation of new capital projects, and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $154 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This 18% increase in operating income was primarily attributable to improved retail fuel margins and increased in-store sales in the U.S. system, partially offset by higher selling expenses due mainly to an increase in credit card processing fees. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, environmental expenses, and charitable contributions as well as the favorable resolution of a California excise tax dispute in 2005. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense and 2005 nonrecurring expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel. “Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes a pre-tax gain of $328 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in Valero GP Holdings, LLC in 2006, as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2005 to 2006 due to the effect of a full year of interest incurred in 2006 on the debt assumed in the Premcor Acquisition, partially offset by a reduction in other debt outstanding. Capitalized interest increased due to an increase in capital projects, including projects at the four former Premcor refineries. Income tax expense increased $1.0 billion from 2005 to 2006 mainly as a result of a 55% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased from the year ended December 31, 2005 as a lower percentage of our pre-tax income was contributed by the Aruba Refinery, the profits of which are non-taxable in Aruba through December 31, 2010. This increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the effects of new tax legislation in both Texas and Canada in 2006. 30 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004 Financial Highlights

(f) Total throughput volumes and throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast region for the year ended December 31, 2004 are based on 366 days, which results in 183,000 barrels per day being included for the Aruba Refinery for the year ended December 31, 2004. Throughput volumes for the Aruba Refinery for the 302 days of its operations during 2004 averaged 221,000 barrels per day. (g) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (h) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries subsequent to the Premcor Acquisition: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, Memphis, and Lima 34 Table of Contents Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (i) Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Northeast regions for the year ended December 31, 2005 include 78,000, 106,000, and 63,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor commencing on September 1, 2005. Throughput volumes for those acquired refineries for the 122 days of their operations subsequent to the acquisition date of September 1, 2005 were 234,000, 317,000, and 187,000 barrels per day, respectively, for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Northeast regions. (j) The information presented for the Mid-Continent region includes the operations of the Denver Refinery through May 31, 2005, the date of our sale of this facility to Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc. Throughput volumes for the Mid-Continent region include 15,000 and 37,000 barrels per day related to the Denver Refinery for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (k) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services-London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (l) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues increased 50% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of significantly higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations. Operating income and net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating income increased $2.5 billion, or 83%, from 2004 to 2005 due primarily to a $2.6 billion increase in the refining segment, partially offset by a $30 million decrease in the retail segment and a $123 million increase in general and administrative expenses (including corporate depreciation and amortization expense). Refining Operating income for our refining segment increased from $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, resulting mainly from an increase in refining throughput margin of $3.70 per barrel, or 50%, and a 15% increase in throughput volumes, partially offset by an increase in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense) of $977 million and the 2005 LIFO charge discussed in the “2006 Compared to 2005 Results of Operations.” Refining throughput margin for 2005 increased primarily due to the following factors: • Distillate margins increased significantly in all of our refining regions during 2005 compared to 2004, with margins in the Gulf Coast region almost triple the margins in 2004 and margins in the Mid-Continent and Northeast regions more than double 2004 margins. The improvement in distillate margins was due to increased foreign and U.S. demand, resulting from improved U.S. and global economies and higher demand for on-road diesel and jet fuel. In addition, both gasoline and distillate margins increased significantly in September and October of 2005 due to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which reduced the supply of refined products as refineries along the Gulf Coast reduced or shut down their operations because of the hurricanes. • Differentials on our sour crude oil feedstocks improved during 2005 compared to 2004 due to ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. In addition, differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks benefited from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from several factors, including (i) the global movement to cleaner fuels, which has required most refineries to lower the sulfur content of the gasoline they produce, and (ii) a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which has resulted in higher utilization rates by refineries that require sweet crude oil as feedstock. 35 Table of Contents • Throughput volumes increased 326,000 barrels per day in 2005 compared to 2004 due mainly to throughput of 247,000 barrels per day at the four refineries acquired from Premcor on September 1, 2005, incremental throughput of 40,000 barrels per day at the Aruba Refinery, which was acquired in March 2004, and lower volumes in 2004 due to turnarounds at the St. Charles, Benicia, and Wilmington Refineries. The above increases in throughput margin for 2005 were partially offset by the effects of: • lower margins on other refined products such as petroleum coke, sulfur, No. 6 fuel oil, asphalt, and propylene due to a significant increase in the price of crude oil from 2004 to 2005, and • increased pre-tax losses of approximately $295 million on hedges related to forward sales of distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 37% higher for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 due mainly to $420 million of expenses related to the refineries acquired in the Premcor Acquisition, a full year of operations of the Aruba Refinery, and increases in energy costs, employee compensation expense, and maintenance expense. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 39% from 2004 to 2005 due mainly to depreciation expense resulting from the Premcor Acquisition on September 1, 2005, implementation of new capital projects, increased turnaround and catalyst amortization, a $15 million gain in 2004 on the sale of certain property discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the write-off of costs in 2005 resulting from the decision to convert wholesale sites marketing under the Diamond Shamrock brand to the Valero brand. Retail Retail operating income was $154 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of 16% between the periods. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased selling expenses in the U.S. and Canada as higher retail fuel prices resulted in higher credit card processing fees. In addition, Canada’s selling expenses increased $15 million due to an increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, the recognition of increased variable compensation expense, resulting in large part from a significant increase in our common stock price during 2005, and expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel. These increases were partially offset by the successful resolution in the first quarter of 2005 of a California excise tax dispute. “Other income (expense), net” improved $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to the combined effect of a $55 million gain realized on the sale of our equity interests in Javelina Company and Javelina Pipeline Company in November 2005 and a 2004 impairment charge of $57 million to write off the carrying amount of our equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. This combined effect, as well as an increase in bank interest income due to higher cash balances, was partially offset by our 50% interest in certain debt refinancing costs incurred in 2005 by the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline joint venture and increased costs related to our accounts receivable sales program. 36 Table of Contents Interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2004 to 2005 due to interest incurred in 2005 on the debt resulting from the Premcor Acquisition. Capitalized interest increased due to an increase in capital projects, including projects at the four former Premcor refineries. Income tax expense increased $791 million from 2004 to 2005 mainly as a result of a 95% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005, however, decreased from the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of a change in permanent book-to-tax differences, which included a deduction from income in 2005 for qualified domestic manufacturing activities, as allowed under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. OUTLOOK In January 2007, we saw industry fundamentals for refined products remain consistent with what we experienced at the end of 2006. The Gulf Coast gasoline margin for January 2007 was $4.62 per barrel, while the West Coast gasoline margin averaged $20.34 per barrel. Regarding distillates, the Gulf Coast on-road diesel margin was $13.00 per barrel and the West Coast on-road diesel margin was $28.94 per barrel. Our outlook for gasoline margins is positive. Gasoline supplies are expected to tighten as spring maintenance activity gets underway. In addition, the industry will soon be making the transition from winter-grade gasoline specifications to summer-grade specifications, which generally leads to declines in inventories and higher margins as we head toward the summer driving season. While these factors are expected to reduce supplies, gasoline demand is expected to remain positive this year as a result of lower pump prices and a continuing strong economy. This positive demand trend combined with the expected pressure on supplies should create a tightening of the supply/demand balance. The outlook for low-sulfur distillate margins is also favorable as on-road diesel demand continues to be strong. Currently, approximately 80% of our U.S. on-road distillate production is ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) and we are on schedule to meet the EPA’s phase-in requirements for ULSD by the end of the transition period in June 2007. In addition, specifications requiring a reduction in the amount of sulfur in off-road diesel (excluding marine and railroad uses) go into effect in June of this year, which may further tighten supplies. As a result, we expect the favorable spread between on-road and off-road diesel prices to continue. Sour crude oil differentials are expected to remain favorable for the foreseeable future. Persistently weak residual fuel oil prices support wider differentials for sour crude oil since complex refiners can substitute residual fuel oil for a portion of their sour crude oil purchases if residual fuel oil becomes more economic to process than crude oil. In addition, the flexibility of many of our refineries to process alternative sour crude oils allows us to continue to find attractively priced feedstocks. Operationally during 2007, we expect to benefit from our recently completed Port Arthur crude unit expansion which allows us to process up to 325,000 barrels per day of sour crude oil at that refinery. On February 16, 2007, our McKee Refinery experienced a fire in its propane deasphalting unit. As of the filing of this annual report, the entire McKee Refinery remains shut down while efforts are underway to determine the cause of the accident, assess damages, and establish a plan for making repairs. Full scale efforts to assess damages, make repairs, and restart the refinery are underway though we do not yet have a firm estimated date for commencement of operations. Although we are in the preliminary stages of assessing the extent of damages, we do not believe that this incident will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the first quarter of 2007. 37 Table of Contents Overall, we believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the expected continuing positive industry fundamentals during 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $6.3 billion compared to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the significant increase in operating income discussed above under “Results of Operations,” partially offset by a $1.2 billion decrease from an unfavorable change in working capital between the years and a $1.0 billion increase in current income tax expense. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary difference in the working capital changes between the two years resulted from a favorable working capital change in 2005 attributable to the factors discussed below in “Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2005.” Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2006 due mainly to price increases for gasoline and crude oil. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2006, combined with $880 million of proceeds from the sale of our ownership interest in Valero GP Holdings, LLC, a $206 million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized stock-based compensation cost, and $122 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans, were used mainly to: • fund $3.8 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • purchase 34.6 million shares of treasury stock at a cost of $2.0 billion; • make long-term note repayments of $249 million; • fund $101 million of contingent earn-out payments in connection with the acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc., the St. Charles Refinery, and the Delaware City Refinery; • terminate our interest rate swap contracts for $54 million; • pay common and preferred stock dividends of $184 million; and • increase available cash on hand by $1.2 billion. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $5.9 billion compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $2.9 billion. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the significant increase in operating income discussed above under “Results of Operations” and an $879 million increase from favorable working capital changes between the years, as reflected in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2005, working capital was positively impacted by a $400 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program and a decrease in restricted cash of approximately $200 million due to the repayment of certain debt assumed in the Premcor Acquisition using funds restricted for that purpose. Both receivables and accounts payable increased significantly due to commodity price increases from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. The net cash generated from operating activities during 2005, combined with $428 million of available cash on hand, $182 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans, $78 million of proceeds from the sale of our investment in the Javelina joint venture, $45 million of proceeds from the sale of the Denver Refinery, and a $38 million net return of investment from the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline joint venture resulting mainly from the refinancing of the joint venture’s debt in June 2005, were used mainly to: • fund $2.6 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; • make long-term note repayments of $874 million; 38 Table of Contents • fund $2.3 billion of the Premcor Acquisition, net of cash acquired; • purchase 13 million shares of treasury stock at a cost of $571 million; • fund contingent earn-out payments of $85 million in connection with prior acquisitions; • fund certain minor acquisitions for $62 million; • make a general partner contribution to Valero L.P. of $29 million; and • pay common and preferred stock dividends of $106 million. Capital Investments During the year ended December 31, 2006, we expended $3.2 billion for capital expenditures and $569 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2006 included approximately $1.6 billion of costs related to environmental projects. In addition, we expended $101 million for amounts due under contingent earn-out agreements. In connection with our acquisitions of Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997 and the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the sellers are entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years and seven years, respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified level (see the discussion in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In connection with the Premcor Acquisition, we assumed Premcor’s obligation under a contingent earn-out agreement related to Premcor’s acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery from Motiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva). Under this agreement, Motiva was entitled to receive two separate annual earn-out contingency payments depending on (a) the amount of crude oil processed at the refinery and the level of refining margins through May 2007, and (b) the achievement of certain performance criteria at the gasification facility through May 2006. The earn-out contingency related to the gasification facility expired in 2006 with no payment required. Payments due under all of these earn-out arrangements are limited based on annual and aggregate limits. During 2006, we made earn-out payments of $26 million (the maximum remaining payment based on the aggregate limitation under the agreement) related to the acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc., $50 million related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery, and $25 million related to the acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery. In January 2007, we made an earn-out payment of $50 million related to the St. Charles Refinery. Based on estimated margin levels through April 2007, earn-out payments of $25 million (the maximum remaining payment based on the aggregate limitation under the agreement) related to the acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery would be due in the second quarter of 2007. For 2007, we expect to incur approximately $3.5 billion for capital investments, including approximately $3.1 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $800 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $400 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to the contingent earn-out agreements discussed above and strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Long-term debt $ 462 $ 6 $ 209 $ 33 $ 418 $ 3,946 $ 5,074 Capital lease obligations 9 10 10 10 9 84 132 Operating lease obligations 413 331 243 161 100 238 1,486 Purchase obligations 19,955 7,090 1,657 311 302 2,333 31,648 Other long-term liabilities — 183 155 153 145 986 1,622 Total $ 20,839 $ 7,620 $ 2,274 $ 668 $ 974 $ 7,587 $ 39,962 39 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt Payments for long-term debt are at stated values. During March 2006, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $220 million related to our 7.375% notes. In addition, during 2006, we made debt payments of $29 million related to various notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2006, “current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations” as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet included mainly $230 million of notes which become due in April 2007 and $50 million of notes which become due in November 2007, as well as $175 million of notes with a maturity date of February 2010 which were redeemed in February 2007, as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of December 31, 2006, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above “investment grade” level as follows: Rating Agency Rating Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook) Moody’s Investors Service Baa3 (stable outlook) Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook) Operating Lease Obligations Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities, feedstock, and storage to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short-term and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2006, our short-term and long-term purchase obligations decreased by approximately $2.0 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2005. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in obligations under crude oil supply contracts, partially offset by new contracts in 2006. We have not made in the past, nor do we expect to make in the future, payments for feedstock or services that we have not received or will not receive, nor paid prices in excess of then prevailing market conditions. 40 Table of Contents Other Long-term Liabilities Our “other long-term liabilities” are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For most of these liabilities, the timing of the payment of such liabilities is not fixed and therefore cannot be determined as of December 31, 2006. However, certain expected payments related to our anticipated pension contribution in 2007 and our other postretirement benefit obligations are discussed in Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2006. Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2006, our committed lines of credit were as follows: Borrowing Capacity Expiration Revolving credit facility $ 2.5 billion August 2011 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn. $ 115 million December 2010 As of December 31, 2006, we had $343 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities, Cdn. $85 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Canadian committed revolving credit facility, and $245 million of letters of credit outstanding under our committed revolving credit facility. These letters of credit expire during 2007, 2008, and 2009. Stock Purchase Programs Our board of directors has approved our purchase of treasury stock in open market transactions to satisfy employee benefit plan requirements as well as purchases under our publicly announced stock purchase programs. Under these authorizations, we purchased approximately 5% of our outstanding shares during 2006. We purchased 28.9 million shares for $1.6 billion related to our employee benefit plans and 5.7 million shares for $361 million under our former stock purchase program. On October 19, 2006, our board of directors approved a new $2 billion common stock purchase program. This new authorization is in addition to our existing authorization for employee benefit plan requirements. Stock purchases under this program will be made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and are subject to market conditions and other factors. The program does not have a scheduled expiration date. During 2006, we purchased no shares under our new $2 billion stock purchase program. Sale of Investment in Valero GP Holdings, LLC On July 19, 2006, Valero GP Holdings, LLC consummated an initial public offering (IPO) of 17,250,000 of its units representing limited liability company interests to the public at $22.00 per unit, before an underwriters’ discount of $1.265 per unit. On December 22, 2006, Valero GP Holdings, LLC completed a secondary public offering of 20,550,000 units representing limited liability company interests at a price of $21.62 per unit, before an underwriters’ discount of $0.8648 per unit. In addition, 4,700,000 unregistered units of Valero GP Holdings, LLC were sold to its chairman of the board of directors (who was at that time also chairman of Valero’s board of directors) at $21.62 per unit. All such units were sold by our subsidiaries that held various ownership interests in Valero GP Holdings, LLC. As a result, Valero GP Holdings, LLC did not receive any proceeds from these offerings, and our indirect ownership interest in Valero GP Holdings, LLC was reduced to zero. Proceeds to our selling subsidiaries from the IPO totaled approximately $355 million, net of the underwriters’ discount and other offering expenses, which resulted in a pre-tax gain to us of $132 million on the sale of the units. Proceeds to our selling subsidiaries from the secondary offering and private sale of units totaled 41 Table of Contents approximately $525 million, net of the underwriters’ discount and other offering expenses, which resulted in an additional pre-tax gain to us of $196 million. The total pre-tax gain of $328 million is included in “other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. The funds received from these offerings are being used for general corporate purposes. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2006, we contributed $343 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.75% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 104% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2006. Although we have no expected minimum required contribution to our qualified pension plans during 2007 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, we expect to contribute approximately $100 million to our qualified plans during 2007. Environmental Matters We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. For additional information regarding our environmental matters, see Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Tax Matters We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. For example, effective January 1, 2007, the Government of Aruba (GOA) enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods produced and services rendered in Aruba. The turnover tax, which is 3% for on-island sales and services and 1% on export sales, is being assessed by the GOA on sales by our Aruba Refinery. However, due to a previous tax holiday that was granted to our Aruba Refinery by the GOA through December 31, 2010, we believe that sales by our Aruba Refinery should not be subject to this turnover tax. We have filed a request for arbitration with the Netherlands Arbitration Institute pursuant to which we will seek to enforce our rights under this tax holiday. Other During the third quarter of 2005, certain of our refineries experienced property damage and business interruption losses associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As a result of these losses, we submitted claims to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies. As of December 31, 2006, we have recorded a receivable related to our property damage claims, which was recorded as a reduction of repair and maintenance expense. No amounts related to the potential business interruption insurance recoveries were accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 as we had not reached a final settlement with the insurance carriers. During 2006, we reached a final business interruption settlement with our insurance carriers, the proceeds from which were recorded as a reduction to “cost of sales.” Amounts received or to be received for these matters are immaterial to our results of operations and financial position. On February 1, 2007, we announced our plan to explore strategic alternatives for our Lima Refinery, which we acquired in the Premcor Acquisition. 42 Table of Contents Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from the public and private capital markets and bank markets, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Accounts Receivable Sales Facility As of December 31, 2006, we had an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables, which matures in August 2008. We use this program as a source of working capital funding. Under this program, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third-party financial institutions. We remain responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pay certain fees related to our sale of receivables under the program. As of December 31, 2006, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party financial institutions was $1 billion. Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional discussion of the activity related to this program. Termination of this program would require us to obtain alternate working capital funding, which would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on our consolidated balance sheet. However, as of December 31, 2006, the termination of this program would not have had a material effect on our liquidity and would not have affected our ability to comply with restrictive covenants in our credit facilities. We are not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, nor is expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 43 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long-lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method investments, and deferred tax assets) are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans. However, providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. We recognized an impairment charge of $57 million in 2004 related to our equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. as discussed in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the 44 Table of Contents determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes. The balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 is included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that we have adequately accrued for our environmental exposures. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption is based on a review of long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2006 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2007 (in millions): Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits Increase in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease $ 59 $ 17 Compensation rate increase 23 — Health care cost trend rate increase — 11 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease 9 2 Expected return on plan assets decrease 3 — Compensation rate increase 5 — Health care cost trend rate increase — 2 Tax Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax 45 Table of Contents liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. Legal Liabilities A variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. Although we have been successful in defending litigation in the past, we cannot be assured of similar success in future litigation due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the individual fact circumstances in each case. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). The carrying amount of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories was $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and the fair value of such inventories was $7.1 billion as of both December 31, 2006 and 2005. From time to time, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). We also use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. Finally, we enter into derivative commodity instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. See “Derivative Instruments” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures, and options. Our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy which has been approved by our board of directors. 46 Table of Contents The following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including: • fair value hedges which are used to hedge our recognized refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments (i.e., binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future); • cash flow hedges which are used to hedge our forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; • economic hedges (hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges) which are used to: - manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, and - manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; and • derivative commodity instruments held or issued for trading purposes. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of “other comprehensive income” and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic hedges and for derivative instruments entered into by us for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. The following tables include only open positions at the end of the indicated reporting period, and therefore do not include amounts related to closed cash flow hedges for which the gain or loss remains in “accumulated other comprehensive income” pending consummation of the forecasted transactions. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. For futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period-end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. The pre-tax fair value for futures, swaps, and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. The pre-tax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the pre-tax fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options represents their strike price. 47 Table of Contents December 31, 2006 Contract Volumes Wtd Avg Pay Price Wtd Avg Receive Price Contract Value Market Value Pre-tax Fair Value Fair Value Hedges: Futures – long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 15,261 $ 63.66 N/A $ 972 $ 949 $ (23 ) Futures – short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 22,091 N/A $ 64.56 1,426 1,379 47 Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps – long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 39,125 70.14 65.16 N/A (195 ) (195 ) Swaps – short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 39,125 69.66 76.30 N/A 260 260 Futures – long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 21,087 64.75 N/A 1,365 1,336 (29 ) Futures – short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 18,356 N/A 64.82 1,190 1,161 29 Economic Hedges: Swaps – long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 13,244 12.02 11.02 N/A (13 ) (13 ) 2007 (natural gas) 893 0.76 0.78 N/A — — Swaps – short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 7,605 26.47 27.66 N/A 9 9 2007 (natural gas) 833 0.85 0.89 N/A — — Futures – long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 50,442 64.28 N/A 3,242 3,171 (71 ) 2007 (natural gas) 400 7.33 N/A 3 3 — Futures – short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 51,623 N/A 64.15 3,312 3,252 60 2007 (natural gas) 400 N/A 8.21 3 3 — Options – long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 31 84.29 N/A — — — Options – short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 1,478 N/A 61.94 — (6 ) 6 Trading Activities: Futures – long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 801 77.29 N/A 62 59 (3 ) Futures – short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 801 N/A 84.87 68 58 10 Total pre-tax fair value of open positions $ 87 48 Table of Contents December 31, 2005 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Pre-tax Contract Pay Receive Contract Market Fair Volumes Price Price Value Value Value Fair Value Hedges: Futures – long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 50,912 $ 59.03 N/A $ 3,005 $ 3,113 $ 108 Futures – short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 64,422 N/A $ 59.87 3,857 3,958 (101 ) Cash Flow Hedges: Futures – long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 18,179 62.24 N/A 1,131 1,152 21 Futures – short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 13,690 N/A 60.51 828 849 (21 ) Economic Hedges: Swaps – long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 7,947 8.12 8.81 N/A 5 5 2006 (natural gas) 2,700 11.37 9.19 N/A (6 ) (6 ) Swaps – short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 4,481 17.27 16.85 N/A (2 ) (2 ) 2006 (natural gas) 1,350 9.19 11.46 N/A 3 3 Futures – long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 29,945 65.64 N/A 1,966 2,036 70 Futures – short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 27,052 N/A 65.34 1,768 1,815 (47 ) Options – long: 2006 (natural gas) 1,290 9.27 N/A (2 ) (1 ) 1 Options – short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 190 N/A 72.95 (1 ) (1 ) — 2006 (natural gas) 690 N/A 7.98 — — — Trading Activities: Swaps – long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 300 11.64 11.94 N/A — — 2006 (natural gas) 350 9.33 11.28 N/A 1 1 Swaps – short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 1,350 12.66 13.17 N/A 1 1 2006 (natural gas) 350 11.28 9.18 N/A (1 ) (1 ) Futures – long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 12,266 60.01 N/A 736 763 27 2006 (natural gas) 840 8.03 N/A 6 9 3 Futures – short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 10,816 N/A 60.49 654 678 (24 ) 2006 (natural gas) 840 N/A 8.34 7 9 (2 ) Options – long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 2,000 0.50 N/A — — — 2006 (natural gas) 900 10.00 N/A — — — Options – short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 2,000 N/A 0.50 — — — 2006 (natural gas) 900 N/A 10.00 — — — Total pre-tax fair value of open positions $ 36 49 Table of Contents INTEREST RATE RISK Our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our long-term debt obligations. We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged is recorded in interest expense. The recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and long-term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. The following table provides information about our long-term debt and interest rate derivative instruments (dollars in millions), all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted-average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted-average floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. December 31, 2006 Expected Maturity Dates 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 There- after Total Fair Value Long-term Debt: Fixed rate $ 462 $ 6 $ 209 $ 33 $ 418 $ 3,946 $ 5,074 $ 5,361 Average interest rate 7.3 % 6.0 % 3.6 % 6.8 % 6.4 % 7.1 % 6.9 % December 31, 2005 Expected Maturity Dates 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 There- after Total Fair Value Long-term Debt: Fixed rate $ 220 $ 287 $ 6 $ 209 $ 208 $ 4,392 $ 5,322 $ 5,735 Average interest rate 7.4 % 6.1 % 6.0 % 3.6 % 8.9 % 7.0 % 6.9 % Interest Rate Swaps Fixed to Floating: Notional amount $ 125 $ 225 $ — $ 9 $ — $ 641 $ 1,000 $ (28 ) Average pay rate 6.5 % 6.2 % 5.8 % 5.9 % 5.9 % 5.6 % 5.9 % Average receive rate 6.0 % 5.8 % 5.7 % 5.7 % 5.7 % 5.6 % 5.7 % On May 1, 2006, we terminated the $875 million of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at that date for a payment of $54 million. Substantially all of this payment was deferred and is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining lives of the debt instruments that were being hedged. 50 Table of Contents FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK We enter into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our Canadian operations. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. As of December 31, 2006, we had commitments to purchase $290 million of U.S. dollars. Our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before January 19, 2007, resulting in a 2007 gain of $4 million. 51 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:44:32.654064
